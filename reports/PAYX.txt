FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ROCHESTER, NY, June 25, 2002  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $68.7 million, or $.18 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended May 31, 2002, a 1% increase over net income of $67.8 million, or $.18 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $244.3 million, a 7% increase over $228.6 million for the fourth quarter last year.
For the twelve months ended May 31, 2002, the Company reported record net income of $274.5 million, or $.73 diluted earnings per share, an 8% increase over $254.9 million, or $.68 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $954.9 million, an increase of 10% over $869.9 million for the same period last year.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
The Company began to experience the effects of the economic recession during the first quarter of fiscal 2002, and these effects continued throughout the year. In response to the declining economic conditions, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate eleven times for a cumulative 475 basis point reduction. The last reduction in the Federal Funds rate occurred in December 2001. The short- and long-term effects of changing interest rates are disclosed in detail in the Company's financial statements and recent SEC filings, which are accessible on the Company's Web site at www.paychex.com.
In addition to the effects of volatile interest rates, the impact of a recessionary economy has resulted in a lower number of checks per client, as existing clients reduce their work forces. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company experienced a 3.0% year-over-year decline in checks per client compared to 4.8% in the third quarter, 4.3% in the second quarter and 2.6% in the first quarter. For the full year fiscal 2002, checks per client declined 3.7%. During the recession of the early 1990's, the Company experienced a total reduction in checks per client of approximately 3%.
Despite these factors, income before taxes remained strong at 41% of revenues for the twelve months of fiscal 2002, compared with 42% for the same period last year. The Company estimates that if the interest rates and checks per client conditions experienced in fiscal 2000 had continued throughout fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, net income growth in fiscal 2001 would have been approximately 25% compared with actual growth of 34%, and net income growth in fiscal 2002 would have been approximately 20%.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended May 31, 2002, service revenues, which are comprised of the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $230.5 million, an increase of 12% over $206.0 million for the prior year quarter. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2002, service revenues were $892.2 million, an increase of 13% over $786.5 million for the same period last year.
Payroll service revenue increased 10% to $196.5 million from $179.2 million for the prior year fourth quarter. For the twelve-month period, Payroll service revenue increased 12% to $770.2 million from $688.7 million for the prior year period. The increases in Payroll service revenue reflect growth in the client base, increased utilization of ancillary services and price increases. As of May 31, 2002, 85% of Paychex clients utilized Taxpay, the Company's tax filing and payment feature. The Company's Employee Pay Services were utilized by 57% of its clients. Major Market Services revenue increased 51% for both the fourth quarter and twelve-month periods to $20.3 million and $71.7 million, respectively. Human Resource and Benefits service revenue was $34.0 million, an increase of 27% over $26.8 million for the fourth quarter last year. For the twelve-month period, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 25% to $121.9 million from $97.9 million for the prior year period. The increases are related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services
 
revenue increased 31% and 30% in the fourth quarter and twelve-month periods to $15.2 million and $56.5 million, respectively.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
For the quarter ended May 31, 2002, interest on funds held for clients was $13.8 million, a 39% decrease from $22.7 million for the fourth quarter last year. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2002, interest on funds held for clients decreased 25% to $62.7 million from $83.3 million. The decreases are primarily the result of lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2002 offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. For the quarter, net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients decreased to $1.5 million compared with $2.5 million in the prior year fourth quarter. For the twelve-month period of fiscal 2002, net realized gains increased to $9.2 million compared with $5.7 million in the respective prior year period.
OPERATING INCOME
For the quarter ended May 31, 2002, operating income was $91.6 million, an increase of 5% over $87.6 million for the fourth quarter last year. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2002, operating income increased 8% to $363.7 million from $336.7 million in the prior year period. Combined operating and selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the twelve-month period over the prior year periods. These increases reflect increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the growth of the Company.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net for the quarter ended May 31, 2002 decreased 16% to $7.2 million from $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of last year primarily due to lower average interest rates. Investment income, net for the twelve-month period increased 15% to $31.3 million from $27.3 million in the prior year period. The increase is due to net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average daily invested balances offset by the impact of lower average interest rates in fiscal 2002. Net realized gains included in investment income were $1.5 million and $6.7 million for the fourth quarter and twelve-month periods of fiscal 2002 compared with net realized gains of $1.3 million and $1.7 million for the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The income tax rate for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended May 31, 2002 was 30.5%, as compared to 29.5% and 30.0% for the same periods last year.
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased to have completed our twelfth consecutive year of record total revenues and net income. These results were achieved despite a difficult economic and interest rate environment, as we remained focused on growing our client base, increasing utilization of ancillary services, and controlling expenses. On an encouraging note, while year-over-year checks per client continue to reflect declines, we are beginning to see indications of improving check conditions in our client base. We have based our fiscal 2003 expectations on current economic conditions remaining in place with no significant changes. Accordingly, we anticipate achieving record total revenues and net income in fiscal 2003, and estimate total revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10% with net income growth approximating or slightly less than total revenue growth."

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reviews the Company's operating results for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended May 31, 2002 (fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000), and its financial condition at May 31, 2002. This review provides additional analysis and disclosure than that contained in the Company's June 25, 2002 press release, which is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
This review is not a complete and comprehensive discussion and analysis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission for Annual Reports filed on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company expects to file its fiscal 2002 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 90 days after the May 31, 2002 fiscal year-end. The fiscal 2002 Form 10-K will contain a complete set of audited Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Forward-looking statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis are qualified by the "Safe Harbor" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 included in the Company's Press Release, which is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Critical Accounting Policies:
The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to investments, allowance for doubtful accounts, fixed assets, income taxes, contingencies, and our clients' ability to meet their payroll obligations. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to the Company's results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
Service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Professional Employer Organization (PEO) revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $1,056.9 million, $865.7 million, and $731.3 million for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Paychex provides delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports. The revenue earned from delivery service is included in service revenues and the costs for delivery are included in operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on Taxpay and Employee Pay Services funds that are collected before due dates and invested (funds held for clients) until remittance to the applicable tax authorities for Taxpay clients and employees of Employee Pay Services clients. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities.
As part of providing Payroll, Taxpay, and Employee Pay Services, Paychex is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct
 
deposits. Electronic money funds transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of losses resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers.
The Company's investments in debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on the Company's Statement of Stockholders' Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impacts the Company's net income only when such investments are sold. The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds.
Results of Operations:
For fiscal 2002, the Company completed its twelfth consecutive year of record total revenues and net income and now services over 390,000 clients. The results for fiscal 2002 have been affected by recessionary economic conditions in the U.S. and lower interest rates. The Company's results of operations are summarized as follows:
 
Details regarding the Company's combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
Total service revenues are comprised of revenues from the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from Payroll, Taxpay, Employee Pay Services, and other ancillary services. Employee Pay Services include the Direct Deposit, Readychex, and Access Card products. Human Resource and Benefits service revenues are earned primarily from Retirement Services, Workers' Compensation Insurance Administration, Section 125 Plan Administration, and Paychex Administrative Services and Professional Employer Organization bundled services.
The increases in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 compared with the respective prior year periods are attributable to the addition of new clients, new services, price increases, and increased utilization of ancillary services by both new and existing clients. As of May 31, 2002, 85% of Paychex clients utilized Taxpay, the Company's tax filing and payment feature, compared with 83% at the end of 2001 and 81% at the end of 2000. Client utilization of the Taxpay product is expected to mature in the range of 85% to 87%. The Company's Employee Pay Services were utilized by 57% of its clients at May 31, 2002 compared with 53% at the end of 2001 and 47% at the end of 2000. Major Market
 
Services revenues totaled $71.7 million, $47.4 million, and $30.0 million for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 51% for fiscal 2002 and 58% for fiscal 2001. Approximately one-third of new Major Market Services clients are conversions from the Company's Core Payroll service.
The increases in Human Resource and Benefits service revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 are primarily related to increases in the number of clients for Retirement Services and increases in Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) client employees serviced. The increase in Retirement Services clients reflects the continuing interest of small- to medium-sized businesses in offering retirement savings benefits to their employees. Retirement Services revenues totaled $56.5 million, $43.3 million, and $31.5 million in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 30% for fiscal 2002 and 37% for fiscal 2001. The Company serviced over 23,000 and over 19,000 Retirement Services clients at May 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) product is a package of payroll, employer compliance, employee benefits administration, and risk management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for small businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs. This product was introduced in May 2000 and was available nationwide by the end of fiscal 2001. The Company's PEO product provides primarily the same bundled services as the PAS product, but with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the client's employees. The PEO service is available primarily in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have been strong, with administrative fee revenue from these products increasing 41% and 50% for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The PAS and PEO products serviced over 80,000 and over 60,000 client employees as of May 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The decline in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2002 is primarily the result of lower interest rates in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 offset by net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances. In fiscal 2001, interest on funds held for clients increased over fiscal 2000 levels due to higher comparable average interest rates, net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances.
The increases in combined operating and SG&A expenses reflect increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the overall growth of the Company. At May 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 7,400 employees compared with approximately 7,300 at the end of fiscal 2001. The Company has made an investment in sales and operations personnel and technology for the MMS and PAS product expansions during fiscal 2002 and 2001.
Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from the Company's cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income, net does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenues. The increases in investment income, net in fiscal 2002 and 2001 are primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and the increase in average daily invested balances. The increase for fiscal 2002 was offset by lower average interest rates compared with fiscal 2001. The increase for fiscal 2001 reflected the benefit of higher average interest rates compared with fiscal 2000.
The effective income tax rate was 30.5% in fiscal 2002 compared with 30.0% in fiscal 2001 and 31.0% in fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2003's effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 31.0%.
Economic Conditions and Outlook:
The Company began to experience the effects of the economic recession in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, and these effects continued throughout the fiscal year. In response to the declining economic conditions, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate eleven times since January 2001 to 1.75%, which represents a cumulative 475 basis point reduction. The last reduction in the Federal Funds rate occurred in December 2001. Year-over-year comparisons for interest on funds held for clients and
 
corporate investment income combined were down 15% in fiscal 2002, but were up 47% and 16% in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. The impact of the rate cuts on year-over-year comparisons for interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income was more significant in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2002.
In addition to the effects of volatile interest rates, the impact of a recessionary economy has resulted in a lower number of checks per client as existing clients reduce their work forces. For fiscal 2002, checks per client declined 3.7% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company experienced a 3.0% decline in checks per client compared to 4.8% in the third quarter, 4.3% in the second quarter, and 2.6% in the first quarter. During the recession of the early 1990's, the Company experienced a total reduction in checks per client of approximately 3%.
Despite the above factors, income before taxes remained strong at 41% of total revenues during fiscal 2002, compared with 42% in fiscal 2001 and 38% in fiscal 2000. In addition, the Company continued to leverage its infrastructure as operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% in fiscal 2002 compared with 32% in fiscal 2001 and 30% in fiscal 2000. The Company estimates that if the interest rates and checks per client conditions experienced in fiscal 2000 had continued throughout fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002, net income growth for fiscal 2001 would have been approximately 25% compared with actual growth of 34%, and net income growth for fiscal 2002 would have been approximately 20% compared with actual growth of 8%.
The Company has based fiscal 2003 expectations on current economic conditions remaining in place with no significant changes. Accordingly, for fiscal 2003, the Company projects Payroll service revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11% and Human Resource and Benefits service revenue growth in the range of 17% to 19%. Total service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 12%. The Company expects interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income combined to be down approximately 15%.
Taking the aforementioned factors into consideration, the Company anticipates achieving record total revenues and net income for fiscal 2003 and estimates total revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% with net income growth approximating or slightly less than total revenue growth.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
The Company has funded its operations, capital purchases, purchases of corporate investments, and dividend payments primarily through cash generated from its operating activities. At May 31, 2002, the Company had $725 million in available cash and corporate investments. Projected operating cash flows are expected to adequately support normal business operations, purchases of property and equipment, and current dividend payments. The Company has two available, uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit from various banks totaling $140 million at market rates of interest. The Company also has an available, uncommitted, secured line of credit from a bank totaling $350 million at a market rate of interest. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2002 or at May 31, 2002. As of May 31, 2002, future minimum lease payments under various non-cancelable operating leases with terms of more than one year are as follows:
 
Operating activities
Operating cash flows in fiscal 2002 were comparable with fiscal 2001 as higher net income was offset by higher uses of working capital. The higher use of working capital was related primarily to the timing of payments for payroll-related, income tax, and other liabilities and timing of payments for PEO and PAS payroll liabilities. The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to higher net income.
Investing activities
Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
The reported amount of funds held for clients will vary significantly based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to the applicable tax authorities for Taxpay clients and employees of clients utilizing Employee Pay Services. Cash used in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relates to purchases of corporate investments. Corporate investments have increased due to the investment of growing cash balances provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and dividend payments. Refer to the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review for additional discussion of interest rates and related risks.
To support the Company's continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2002, the Company made purchases of property and equipment of $54.4 million compared with $45.3 million of purchases in fiscal 2001 and $34.2 million in fiscal 2000. Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2003 are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, including the purchase of a 220,000 square foot facility in Rochester, New York which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $33 million to $35 million.
Purchases of property and equipment:
During fiscal 2002, the Company began constructing a data center to consolidate the location and operation of certain data processing equipment and software and enhance disaster recovery capabilities. Purchases of data processing equipment and software and building improvements in fiscal 2002 for the data center were approximately $18.3 million. During fiscal 2002, the Company purchased through negotiated transactions approximately $11.2 million of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors of Paychex.
 
Financing activities
In October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a 22.2% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.11 per share from $.09 per share. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.09 per share from $.06 per share. Future dividends are dependent on the Company's future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company declared a three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend in May of 2000.
Dividends paid:
The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options is primarily due to an increase in number of shares exercised and an increase in the comparable average exercise price per share. Shares exercised in fiscal 2002 were 2,212,000 compared with 1,878,000 shares in fiscal 2001 and 1,532,000 shares in fiscal 2000. The Company has recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $24.1 million, $26.4 million, and $19.4 million for fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001, and fiscal 2000, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid-in-capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes.
Proceeds from exercise of stock options:
Other:
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 141 requires that all future business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the use of the pooling-of-interest method is prohibited for transactions initiated after July 1, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. This statement recognizes that goodwill has an indefinite useful life and will no longer be subject to periodic amortization, but rather periodically evaluated for impairment. The statement also requires an evaluation of existing acquired goodwill and other intangible assets for proper classification under the new requirements. The Company adopted these standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Based on the provisions of SFAS No. 142, amounts previously recorded as goodwill were reclassified to intangible assets. Adoption of these standards did not impact the results of operations or financial position of the Company.
New Accounting Pronouncements:
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which requires companies to record a liability at fair value for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. This Statement is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this Statement, but does not anticipate adoption of this Statement will result in a material impact to its results of operations or financial position.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of. This
 
Statement is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this statement, but does not anticipate that adoption will result in a material impact to its results of operations or financial position.
Market Risk Factors:
Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities, whereas corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. The Company's available-for-sale debt securities are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held investments and the earnings potential of future investments. Increases in interest rates normally decrease the market value of the available-for-sale securities, while decreases in interest rates increase the market value of the available-for-sale securities. The Company's available-for-sale securities and short-term funds are exposed to earnings risk from changes in interest rates, as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments. Increases in interest rates quickly increase earnings from short-term funds, and over time increase earnings from the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Decreases in interest rates have the opposite earnings effect on the available-for-sale securities and short-term funds. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities do not reflect changes in rates until the investments are sold or mature, and the proceeds are reinvested at current rates. The immediate impact of changing interest rates on earnings from short-term funds may be temporarily offset by realized gains or losses from transactions in the Company's available-for-sale portfolio.
Interest Rate Risk:
The Company directs investments towards high credit-quality, tax-exempt securities to mitigate the risk that earnings from the portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates in the near term. The Company invests in short- to intermediate-term, fixed-rate municipal and government securities, which typically have lower interest rate volatility, and normally manages the securities portfolio to a benchmark duration of 2.5 to 3.0 years. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
The trend in market interest rates during the second half of fiscal 2001 and the first half of fiscal 2002 has been interest rate reductions. The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the last three years:
Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short- and intermediate-term investments, the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change generally affects the Company's tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
 
The total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately $2.85 billion in fiscal 2003. The Company's normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 50% invested in short-term securities with a duration of less than 30 days and 50% invested in intermediate-term municipal securities with an average duration of three years. The Company estimates that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at this point in time would be approximately $3.0 million for fiscal 2003.
The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale investment portfolios reflected unrealized gains of $26.7 million at May 31, 2002 and $20.5 million at May 31, 2001, compared with unrealized losses of $13.4 million at May 31, 2000. During fiscal 2002, the unrealized gain position ranged from approximately $7.5 million (during the fourth quarter) to $35.9 million (during the second quarter). As of May 31, 2002 and May 31, 2001, the Company had $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value, with weighted average yields to maturity of 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at May 31, 2002 would be approximately $8.5 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity, and with no related or immediate impact to the results of operations.
The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA and AA rated securities and A-1 rated short-term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At May 31, 2002, approximately 98% of the available-for-sale securities held an AA rating or better, and all short-term securities classified as cash equivalents held an A-1 or equivalent rating.

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
The registrant's press release dated September 18, 2002, which reports its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 ended August 31, 2002, is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1. This press release also announces that the Company has entered into an agreement to acquire Advantage Payroll Services, Inc.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
     
EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE OF PAYCHEX, INC. DATED SEPTEMBER 18, 2002   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ROCHESTER, NY, September 18, 2002  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $75.9 million, or $.20 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended August 31, 2002, an 8% increase over net income of $70.2 million, or $.19 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $252.7 million, an 8% increase over $234.8 million for the first quarter last year. The Company's financial results continue to be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions and the effect of lower interest rates earned on the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios.
Paychex, Inc. today also announced it entered into an agreement to acquire Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. (Advantage). The purchase price will total approximately $240 million in cash. In addition, Paychex will expend approximately $75 million in cash for the redemption of preferred stock and the repayment of outstanding loan agreements. B. Thomas Golisano, chairman, president and CEO of Paychex, Inc., said, "We are very excited about the merger with Advantage. It is not often a payroll processor of the size and quality of Advantage becomes available. Advantage will provide us with over 49,000 new clients and the opportunity to offer these clients our broad array of Human Resource and Retirement Services products. In addition, the combination of the two companies will allow us to become more efficient in offering services to our clients as well as expand our geographic coverage into areas previously not served by Paychex. It is a great fit for Paychex."
Advantage is a privately owned payroll processor founded in 1967 with a diverse client base of small to mid-sized businesses located throughout the United States. Advantage provides comprehensive payroll and related services through a national network of 41 offices, including 15 independently owned associate offices. Advantage provides a full range of payroll services from the preparation of clients' payroll checks and reports to the preparation and distribution of federal, state and local agency information returns and remittance of related taxes. Charles W. Lathrop, Jr., chairman, president and CEO of Advantage, said, "We look forward to joining the Paychex team. The combination of Paychex and Advantage will enable us to provide a much broader range of services to our clients and allow us to improve our client efficiencies by utilizing the Paychex infrastructure."
Paychex expects Advantage to contribute approximately $75 million in revenue over the next twelve months. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003 we expect the acquisition to be slightly dilutive as the expenses of assimilating the acquisition and amortization of intangibles will not be fully offset by anticipated gains realized in the corporate investment portfolio that will be liquidated in order to pay for the acquisition. Paychex expects future earnings will be accretive as a result of this acquisition.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended August 31, 2002, service revenues, which are comprised of Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $239.4 million, an increase of 11% over $216.2 million for the prior year quarter.
Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $205.5 million from $189.4 million for the prior year first quarter. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from a higher client base, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Payroll service revenues were negatively impacted during the first quarter by a 2.1% year-over-year decrease in checks per client. The declining check volume trend peaked in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 and began to show signs of improving in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The year-over-year reductions in checks per client were 2.6%, 4.3%, 4.8%, and 3.0% in the first through fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, respectively. As of August 31, 2002, 86% of Paychex clients utilized Taxpay, the Company's tax filing and payment feature. The Company's
 
Employee Pay Services were utilized by 58% of its clients. Major Market Services revenue increased 42% in the first quarter to $22.2 million.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue was $33.9 million, an increase of 27% over $26.7 million for the first quarter last year. The increase is related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services revenue increased 26% in the first quarter to $15.6 million.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
For the quarter ended August 31, 2002, interest on funds held for clients was $13.3 million, a 29% decrease from $18.6 million for the first quarter last year. The decrease is primarily the result of lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2003 and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. The average interest rate earned by the funds held for clients portfolio was 2.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 compared with 3.6% for the first quarter last year. The average rate of return was 2.9% in the full year fiscal 2002. Net realized gains for the first quarter which are included in interest on funds held for clients decreased to $1.6 million compared with $3.2 million in the prior year first quarter. Average portfolio balances for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were approximately $1.85 billion compared with approximately $1.73 billion in the prior year quarter.
OPERATING INCOME
For the quarter ended August 31, 2002, operating income was $102.5 million, an increase of 9% over $93.8 million for the same period last year. Combined operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 6% in the first quarter over the prior year period. This increase reflects increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the growth of the Company. The Company continued to leverage its infrastructure as operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 37% for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to 35% in the prior year first quarter.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net for the quarter ended August 31, 2002 increased 11% to $8.4 million from $7.5 million in the first quarter of last year primarily due to higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances offset by lower average interest rates earned. Net realized gains included in investment income, net were $2.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 compared with net realized gains of $1.0 million for the prior year period. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $.75 billion compared to average balances of approximately $.65 billion for the prior year first quarter. The average interest rate earned for the corporate investment portfolio was 3.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 compared with 4.1% for the first quarter of last year. The average return rate for the full year fiscal 2002 was 3.7%.
INCOME TAXES
The income tax rate for the quarter ended August 31, 2002 was 31.5% compared to 30.7% for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
Golisano said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 in light of the current economic conditions and the interest rate environment. Despite these factors, income before taxes remained strong at 44% of total revenues, as we continue to grow our client base, increase utilization of ancillary services, and control expenses. We continue to see indications of slightly improving check conditions in our client base. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2003 is expected to be in the range of 8% to 10%, with net income growth slightly less than total revenue growth. We have based these expectations on current economic conditions continuing with no significant changes and excluding the impact of the acquisition of Advantage."

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
The registrant's press release dated December 19, 2002, which reports its financial results for the second quarter and six months ended November 30, 2002, is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
Exhibit 99.1    Press Release of Paychex, Inc. Dated December 19, 2002

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ROCHESTER, NY, December 19, 2002  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $74.7 million, or $.20 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended November 30, 2002, a 9% increase over net income of $68.7 million, or $.18 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $268.8 million, a 15% increase over $233.0 million for the second quarter last year.
For the six months ended November 30, 2002, the Company reported record net income of $150.6 million, or $.40 diluted earnings per share, an 8% increase over $138.9 million, or $.37 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $521.5 million, an increase of 11% over $467.8 million for the same period last year. The Company's financial growth continues to be adversely impacted by difficult economic conditions and the effect of lower interest rates earned on the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios.
As previously announced, on September 20, 2002 Paychex completed the acquisition of Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage"), a comprehensive payroll processor that serves small- to mid-sized businesses throughout the United States. The purchase price was $240 million in cash. Paychex also paid $74 million in cash for the redemption of preferred stock and the repayment of outstanding debt of Advantage. The acquisition provided Paychex with 49,000 new clients. The Company's second quarter financial results for the period ended November 30, 2002 include the results of Advantage since the date of acquisition. For the second quarter, Advantage revenues included service revenue of $14.1 million and interest on funds held for clients of $1.2 million. Advantage operating and selling, general and administrative expenses were $14.3 million, including $1.6 million in amortization of intangible assets. During the quarter, Paychex also realized $7.0 million of gains related to the sale of corporate investments to fund the acquisition of Advantage. The use of corporate investments to fund the acquisition reduced investment income by $2.0 million during the quarter. The acquisition of Advantage resulted in $.01 of earnings per share accretion for the second quarter and is expected to result in $.01 of earnings per share dilution in each of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. The company expects the results of Advantage to be accretive thereafter.
ACQUISITION OF ADVANTAGE
For the quarter ended November 30, 2002, service revenues, which are comprised of Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $255.7 million, an increase of 18% over $217.5 million for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended November 30, 2002, service revenues were $495.1 million, an increase of 14% over $433.7 million for the same period last year.
SERVICE REVENUES
Payroll service revenue increased 17% to $220.0 million from $188.5 million for the prior year second quarter. For the six-month period, Payroll service revenue increased 13% to $425.5 million from $377.9 million for the prior year period. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the acquisition of Advantage, a higher client base, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Payroll service revenue continues to be impacted by year-over-year decreases in checks per client. The year-over-year reductions in checks per client (excluding Advantage) for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2003 were 2.1% and .8%, respectively. The reductions for the first through fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, respectively, were 2.6%, 4.3%, 4.8%, and 3.0%.
As of November 30, 2002, 86% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services. The Company's employee payment services were utilized by 58% of its clients. Major Market Services revenue increased 44% and 43% for the second quarter and six-month periods to $23.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively.
 
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue was $35.6 million, an increase of 23% over $29.0 million for the second quarter last year. For the six-month period, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 25% to $69.5 million from $55.8 million for the prior year period. The increases are related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services revenue increased 20% and 23% in the second quarter and six-month periods to $16.3 million and $31.9 million, respectively.
For the quarter ended November 30, 2002, interest on funds held for clients was $13.1 million, a 15% decrease from $15.5 million for the second quarter last year. For the six months ended November 30, 2002, interest on funds held for clients decreased 23% to $26.4 million from $34.1 million. The decreases are primarily the result of lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2003 and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 were $1.97 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively, compared with $1.71 billion and $1.72 billion in the prior year quarter and six-month periods. The average interest rate earned by the funds held for clients portfolio was 2.5% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 compared with 3.1% and 3.3% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $.6 million and $2.3 million for the second quarter and six-month periods of fiscal 2003 compared with net realized gains of $2.2 million and $5.4 million for the respective prior year periods.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
For the quarter ended November 30, 2002, operating income was $99.2 million, an increase of 9% over the same period last year. For the six months ended November 30, 2002, operating income increased 9% to $201.7 million. Combined operating and selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 20% in the second quarter and 13% for the six-month period over the prior year periods. These increases reflect increases in personnel, information technology, facility costs and the addition of Advantage. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues remained strong at 34% for the second quarter and 35% for the six-month period of fiscal 2003 compared to 35% in both the respective prior year periods. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 36% exclusive of the Advantage acquisition in the second quarter.
OPERATING INCOME
Investment income, net for the quarter ended November 30, 2002 increased 39% to $11.4 million from $8.2 million in the second quarter of last year. Investment income for the six-month period increased 26% to $19.8 million from $15.7 million in the prior year period. The increases are primarily due to higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities offset by lower average interest rates earned and lower average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $512 million and $631 million for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2003 compared to average balances of $663 million and $655 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rate earned for the corporate investment portfolio was 3.4% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2003 compared with 4.0% in the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in investment income were $7.2 million and $9.6 million for the second quarter and six-month periods of fiscal 2003 compared with net realized gains of $1.8 million and $2.8 million for the respective prior year periods. The higher realized gains and the lower average portfolio balances are the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund the acquisition of Advantage.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
The income tax rates for the second quarter and six months ended November 30, 2002 were 32.5% and 32.0%, respectively, compared to 30.8% for the same periods last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
INCOME TAXES
B.     Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 in light of the current economic and interest rate environment. The integration of Advantage is progressing quite well, and the year-over-year decline in checks per client is slowing. Including Advantage, estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2003 is expected to be in the range of 13% to 15%, with net income growth in the high single digits. Excluding Advantage, the Company estimates total revenue growth in fiscal 2003 to be in the range of 8% to 10%, with net income growth slightly less than total revenue growth. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

ROCHESTER, NY, March 17, 2003  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced it entered into an agreement to acquire InterPay, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation (Fleet). The purchase price is $155 million in cash. "We believe the acquisition of InterPay is good news for Paychex and its shareholders. The addition of a strong payroll service provider with more than 33,000 clients brings many opportunities for Paychex. Further adding to the prospects of this acquisition is the development of a new client referral relationship with Fleet," said B. Thomas Golisano, chairman, president and CEO of Paychex, Inc.
Fleet has also agreed to enter into a referral relationship with Paychex through which Fleet will be able to continue to offer payroll processing and related services to its small and mid-sized business clients on a co-branded basis with Paychex.
"Fleet is committed to offering world-class payroll services to its small and mid-sized commercial clients, as part of a superior suite of financial products and services," said Norman J. DeLuca, managing director, Fleet Business Financial Services. "To that end, we're very pleased to be teaming up with a leading US payroll provider to this market. We know our clients will benefit from Paychex's commitment to their payroll needs."
InterPay, founded in 1971, is a national payroll and human resource administrative services provider primarily focused on small- to medium-sized businesses located in 49 states. InterPay's offices encompass the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., as well as northern Illinois and Florida. InterPay provides a full range of payroll services, including payroll processing, payroll tax filing and employee pay services. Its HR administrative services include workers' compensation solutions, section 125 plans, and employee benefit booklets.
A closing date is expected in early April 2003. Paychex expects InterPay to contribute just over $50 million in revenue during the first 12 months after the acquisition. In the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2003, Paychex anticipates the acquisition will be slightly dilutive as the expenses of assimilating the acquisition and amortization of intangibles will not be fully offset by anticipated gains realized in the corporate investment portfolio that will be liquidated in order to fund the acquisition. Paychex expects future earnings will be accretive as a result of this acquisition.

EXHIBIT 99.1 PRESS RELEASE OF PAYCHEX, INC. DATED MARCH 20, 2003 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE John Morphy, CFO, or Jan Shuler 585-383-3406. Media inquiries, Laura Saxby Lynch 585-383-3074 Access the Webcast of the Paychex, Inc. Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call scheduled for March 21, 2003 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time at www.paychex.com at the Investor Relations home page. Paychex, Inc. news releases, current financial information, related SEC filings and Investor Relations presentation are accessible at the same Web site. PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS ROCHESTER, NY, March 20, 2003 -- Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $71.5 million, or $.19 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended February 28, 2003, a 7% increase over net income of $67.0 million, or $.18 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $287.8 million, a 19% increase over $242.8 million for the third quarter last year. For the nine months ended February 28, 2003, the Company reported record net income of $222.1 million, or $.59 diluted earnings per share, an 8% increase over $205.9 million, or $.54 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $809.3 million, an increase of 14% over $710.6 million for the same period last year. On September 20, 2002, Paychex completed the acquisition of Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage"), a comprehensive payroll processor that serves small- to mid-sized businesses throughout the United States. The Company's financial results for the nine-month period ended February 28, 2003 include the results of Advantage since the date of acquisition. INTERPAY ACQUISITION ANNOUNCED On March 17, 2003, Paychex announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire InterPay, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("Fleet"). The purchase price is $155 million in cash. InterPay is a national payroll and human resource administrative services provider that serves more than 33,000 small- to medium-sized businesses throughout the United States. The acquisition is expected to close in early April 2003. Paychex expects InterPay to contribute approximately $50 million in revenue during the first 12 months after the acquisition. Paychex anticipates the acquisition will be slightly dilutive in the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2003, as the expenses of assimilating the acquisition and amortization of intangible assets will not be fully offset by anticipated gains realized in the corporate investment portfolio that will be liquidated in order to fund the acquisition. Paychex expects future earnings will be accretive as a result of this acquisition. SERVICE REVENUES For the quarter ended February 28, 2003, service revenues, which are comprised of the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $274.3 million, an increase of 20% over $228.0 million for the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended February 28, 2003, service revenues were $769.4 million, an increase of 16% over $661.6 million for the same period last year. Payroll service revenue increased 20% and 15% for the third quarter and nine-month periods to $235.3 million and $660.8 million, respectively. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the acquisition of Advantage, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Payroll service revenue continues to be impacted by year-over-year decreases in checks per client. The year-over-year reductions in checks per client (excluding Advantage) for the first through third quarters of fiscal 2003 were 1.7%, .3%, and .1%, respectively. The reductions for the first through fourth quarters of fiscal 2002, respectively, were 1.9%, 3.8%, 4.1%, and 2.6%. The Company has adjusted the calculation of checks per client to eliminate the impact of client payroll frequency. The Company believes this calculation provides a more accurate indicator of underlying economic demand for its services. As of February 28, 2003, 87% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services. The Company's employee payment services were utilized by 59% of its clients. Major Market Services revenue increased 42% for both the third quarter and nine-month periods to $27.3 million and $73.3 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue was $39.0 million and $108.6 million for the third quarter and nine-month periods, year-over-year increases of 21% and 23%, respectively. The increases are related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services revenue increased 15% and 20% in the third quarter and nine-month periods to $17.6 million and $49.5 million, respectively. INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% for the third quarter and 19% for the nine-month period to $13.5 million and $39.9 million, respectively. The decreases are primarily the result of lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2003 and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances from organic client growth and the acquisition of Advantage. Average portfolio balances for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2003 were $2.37 billion and $2.07 billion, respectively, compared with $1.95 billion and $1.80 billion in the prior year quarter and nine-month periods. The average interest rate earned by the funds held for clients portfolio was 2.1% and 2.4%, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2003 compared with 2.6% and 3.1% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $.7 million and $3.0 million for the third quarter and nine-month periods of fiscal 2003 compared with net realized gains of $2.3 million and $7.6 million for the respective prior year periods. OPERATING INCOME Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 20% in the third quarter and 15% for the nine-month period over the prior year periods. These increases are due to the acquisition of Advantage and increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the growth of the Company. For the quarter ended February 28, 2003, operating income was $101.4 million, an increase of 16% over the same period last year. For the nine months ended February 28, 2003, operating income increased 11% to $303.1 million. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 21% in the third quarter and 18% in the nine-month period to $87.9 million and $263.2 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 32% for the third quarter and 34% for the nine-month period of fiscal 2003, which was comparable to the respective prior year periods. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) exclusive of the Advantage acquisition as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% and 36% in the third quarter and nine months, respectively. ADVANTAGE For the third quarter ended February 28, 2003, Advantage revenues included service revenue of $18.6 million and interest on funds held for clients of $1.4 million. For the nine-month period, Advantage revenues were comprised of $32.7 million of service revenue and $2.6 million of interest on funds held for clients. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for Advantage totaled $17.0 million and $31.3 million, respectively, for the third quarter and nine-month periods. Included in these expenses is amortization of intangible assets of $2.1 million and $3.7 million for the respective quarter and year-to-date periods. The acquisition of Advantage resulted in $.01 of earnings per share accretion since acquisition and is expected to result in $.01 of earnings per share dilution in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company expects the results of Advantage to be accretive in the next fiscal year. INVESTMENT INCOME, NET Investment income, net decreased 55% for the third quarter and 2% for the nine-month period to $3.8 million and $23.5 million, respectively. The decreases are due to lower average portfolio balances, lower average interest rates earned, and the timing of gains realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, Paychex realized $7.0 million of gains related to the sale of corporate investments to fund the acquisition of Advantage. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $495 million and $585 million for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2003 compared to average balances of $697 million and $669 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2003 compared with 3.6% and 3.9% in the respective prior year periods. There were no net realized gains included in investment income for the third quarter and $9.6 million in net realized gains for the nine-month period of fiscal 2003. This compares to net realized gains of $2.4 million and $5.2 million for the respective prior year periods. Page 2 of 5
INCOME TAXES The effective income tax rate was 32.0% for both the third quarter and nine months ended February 28, 2003, compared to 30.0% and 30.5% for the same periods last year. These increases are primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments. B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. In light of current economic conditions, the Company's year-over-year increase in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) of 18% for the first nine months of fiscal 2003 is quite impressive. Including Advantage, estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2003 is expected to be in the range of 13% to 15%, with net income growth in the high single digits. Excluding Advantage, the Company estimates total revenue growth in fiscal 2003 to be in the range of 8% to 10%, with net income growth slightly less than total revenue growth. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes and exclude the impact of the acquisition of InterPay."

ROCHESTER, NY, April 1, 2003  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of InterPay, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation (Fleet). The purchase price totaled $182 million in cash, an increase of $27 million from the $155 million purchase price previously announced.

The resulting cash benefit to Paychex will exceed the price increase but neither the increase nor the tax benefits will affect future statements of income.
The acquisition of InterPay provides Paychex with more than 33,000 new clients and the opportunity to offer those clients Paychex's broad array of Human Resource and Retirement Services products.
InterPay, founded in 1971, is a national payroll and human resource administrative services provider primarily focused on small- to medium-sized businesses located in 49 states. InterPay's offices encompass the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., as well as northern Illinois and Florida.

INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 4% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the twelve-month period to $13.2 million and $53.1 million, respectively. The decreases are primarily the result of lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2003 and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances resulting from organic client growth and the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Average portfolio balances for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2003 were $2.50 billion and $2.18 billion, respectively, compared with $2.01 billion and $1.85 billion in the prior year quarter and twelve-month periods. The average interest rates earned by the funds held for clients portfolio were 1.9% and 2.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2003 compared with 2.4% and 2.9% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $1.0 million and $4.0 million for the fourth quarter and twelve-month periods of fiscal 2003 compared with net realized gains of $1.5 million and $9.2 million for the respective prior year periods.
OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 26% in the fourth quarter and 18% for the twelve-month period over the prior year periods. These increases are due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and investments in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. For the quarter ended May 31, 2003, operating income was $98.0 million, an increase of 7% over the same period last year. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2003, operating income increased 10% to $401.0 million.
Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 9% in the fourth quarter and 16% in the twelve-month period to $84.8 million and $348.0 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 31% for the fourth quarter and 33% for the twelve-month period of fiscal 2003, compared to 34% in both the respective prior year periods. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) exclusive of the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions as a percentage of total service revenues was 33% and 35% in the fourth quarter and twelve months, respectively.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 3% for both the fourth quarter and the twelve-month periods to $7.0 million and $30.5 million, respectively. The decreases are due to lower average portfolio balances (from the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions) and lower average interest rates earned, offset by higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $434.1 million and $547.6 million for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2003 compared to average balances of $739.6 million and $686.5 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 3.0% and 3.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2003 compared with 3.4% and 3.7% in the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in investment income were $4.1 million and $13.7 million for the fourth quarter and twelve-month periods of fiscal 2003, compared to net realized gains of $1.5 million and $6.7 million for the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate was 32.0% for both the fourth quarter and twelve months ended May 31, 2003, compared to 30.5% for the same periods last year. These rate increases are primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 32.5% in fiscal 2004.
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are very pleased to have completed our thirteenth year of record revenues and net income. Given the current economic environment, the Company's 16% year-over-year increase in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) is quite an accomplishment. Fiscal 2003 was a very exciting year as we supplemented our growth with the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Our revenues now exceed $1 billion  just twenty years after Paychex became a public company. We are looking forward to another excellent year in fiscal 2004. We expect total revenue growth for fiscal 2004 to be in the range of 15% to 17% (10% to 12% without Advantage and InterPay) accompanied by net income growth of approximately 10%, as the impact of lower interest rates continues to moderate year-over-year growth. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of
Page 2 of 5
 
15% to 20%. Our expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

The fiscal 2003 Form 10-K will contain a complete set of audited Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Forward-looking statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis are qualified by the "Safe Harbor" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 included in the Company's Press Release, which is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, investments, fixed assets, goodwill and intangible assets, potential losses resulting from its clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to the Company's results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
Service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Professional Employer Organization (PEO) revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $1,460.7 million, $1,056.9 million, and $865.7 million for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Paychex provides delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports. The revenue earned from delivery service is included in service revenues and the costs for delivery are included in operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue Recognition:
Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected before due dates from clients for payroll tax filing and payment services and employee payment services and invested (funds held for clients) until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities.
 
The Company's investments in debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on the Company's Statement of Stockholders' Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impacts the Company's net income only when such investments are sold or permanent impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. Realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net. The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio for potential write-down due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns.
Valuation of Investments:
During Fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") and InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay"). As a result of these purchases, the Company has recorded $393.7 million of goodwill on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2003. The value of this goodwill is based on an allocation of the purchase prices to assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to estimated fair values. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Since the Company's business is largely homogeneous, the Company has determined it will be evaluated as a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
Goodwill:
The Company's intangible assets are primarily comprised of client list acquisitions and license agreements with independently owned associate offices. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 7 to 12 years using accelerated or straight-line methods. The Company periodically reviews its intangible assets for potential impairment.
Intangible Assets:
The carrying value of fixed assets, including costs for software developed for internal use, reflects estimates, assumptions, and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful lives, utilization, and salvage value. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for materials and services and certain payroll and related fringe costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." The Company reviews the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Fixed Assets:
The Company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated with its clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, tax filing and payment service, and employee payment services, Paychex is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money funds transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of losses resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. The Company evaluates uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for Client Fund Losses:
Results of Operations
For fiscal 2003, the Company completed its thirteenth consecutive year of record total revenues and net income and now services approximately 490,000 clients. The Company's financial growth continues to be adversely impacted by the effect of lower interest rates on its funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and difficult economic conditions.
In response to economic conditions, the Federal Reserve has lowered the Federal Funds rate twelve times since January 2001 to 1.25%, for a cumulative 525-basis-point reduction. In addition to the effects
 
of interest rates, the difficult economic conditions have resulted in a lower number of checks per client as existing clients reduce their work forces. The Company experienced a .5% year-over-year decline in checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) in fiscal 2003 compared with a year-over-year decline of 3.0% in fiscal 2002.
The Company's results of operations for fiscal 2003 were impacted by the acquisitions of two payroll service providers servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States. On September 20, 2002, Paychex acquired Advantage for $314 million in cash including the redemption of preferred stock and the repayment of outstanding debt of Advantage. On April 1, 2003, Paychex acquired InterPay for $182 million in cash. These two acquisitions provided Paychex with over 82,000 new clients.
The integration of Advantage and InterPay is in process. By the end of fiscal 2003, the sales forces of these companies were combined with the sales force of Paychex, and the responsibility for their operations and corporate support had been integrated into the management structure of Paychex. In addition, certain branch operations were combined into existing Paychex locations, with more consolidation expected to occur in fiscal year 2004. The Company's focus has been on client service and retention. Approximately 2,000 Advantage clients have been converted to Paychex software platforms since acquisition. The majority of these clients were not using Advantage's core payroll system. The Advantage core payroll system will be retained to service clients affiliated with the independently owned associate offices and other Advantage co-branded products. For InterPay, it is anticipated that clients will be converted to the Paychex software platforms by the end of November 2004.
The results of operations for fiscal 2003, which are summarized in the following table, include the results of Advantage and InterPay since their respective dates of acquisition. The two acquisitions contributed $61.9 million in revenues in fiscal 2003, including $58.0 million of service revenues and $3.9 million of interest on funds held for clients. Operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses for Advantage and InterPay totaled $55.2 million, including $6.7 million for amortization of intangible assets. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company realized approximately $7.0 million of gains from the sale of corporate investments to fund the acquisition of Advantage. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, approximately $3.5 million of gains were realized from the sale of corporate investments to fund the acquisition of InterPay.
 
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
Details regarding the Company's combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
Total service revenues are comprised of revenues from the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from payroll processing, tax filing and payment service, employee payment service, and other ancillary services. Human Resource and Benefits service revenues are earned primarily from Retirement Services, Workers' Compensation Insurance Administration, Section 125 Plan Administration, and Paychex Administrative Services and Professional Employer Organization bundled services.
The increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services by both new and existing clients, and price increases. The increase in Payroll service revenues
 
in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 is attributable to organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services by both new and existing clients, and price increases. Organic client growth was slightly less than 5% in fiscal 2003 and slightly less than 4% in fiscal 2002. Payroll service revenues continue to be impacted by year-over-year changes in checks per client. The year-over-year changes in checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) are as follows:
As of May 31, 2003, 87% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services, compared with 85% at the end of 2002 and 83% at the end of 2001. The Company believes the client utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is near maturity. The Company's employee payment services were utilized by 60% of its clients at May 31, 2003 compared with 57% at the end of 2002 and 53% at the end of 2001. More than 90% of new clients purchase the Company's tax filing and payment services and more than 70% of new clients purchase employee payment services. Major Market Services revenues totaled $101.7 million, $71.7 million, and $47.4 million for fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 42% for fiscal 2003 and 51% for fiscal 2002. Approximately one-third of new Major Market Services clients are conversions from the Company's Core Payroll service.
The increases in Human Resource and Benefits service revenues in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 are primarily related to increases in the number of clients utilizing Retirement Services products and increases in Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) client employees serviced. The increase in Retirement Services clients reflects the continuing interest of small- to medium-sized businesses in offering retirement savings benefits to their employees. Retirement Services revenues totaled $66.7 million, $56.5 million, and $43.3 million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 18% for fiscal 2003 and 30% for fiscal 2002. The Company serviced over 26,000 and over 23,000 Retirement Services clients at May 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) product is a combined package of payroll, employer compliance, employee benefit administration, and risk management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for small businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs. The Company's PEO product provides primarily the same bundled services as the PAS product, but with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the client's employees. The PEO service is available primarily in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have been strong, with administrative fee revenues from these products increasing 40% and 41% for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The PAS and PEO products serviced over 103,000 and over 80,000 client employees as of May 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The decline in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is the result of lower average interest rates earned and a decrease in net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. In fiscal 2002, interest on funds held for clients declined when compared to fiscal 2001 due to lower average interest rates earned offset by higher net realized gains and higher average portfolio balances. The higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and from the growth in the utilization of the Company's tax filing and payment services and employee payment services in both fiscal 2003 and 2002.
 
The increase in consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 is due in part to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. The remaining increase in fiscal 2003 and the increase in fiscal 2002 are due to investments in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. At May 31, 2003, the Company had approximately 8,850 employees compared with approximately 7,400 at the end of fiscal 2002.
Investment income primarily represents earnings from the Company's cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale investment securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenues. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is primarily due to a decrease in average daily invested balances and lower average interest rates earned, offset by higher net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. The increase in investment income in fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 is primarily due to net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and the increase in average daily invested balances, offset by lower average interest rates earned. The decrease in average daily invested balances and higher realized gains in fiscal 2003 are primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions. The Company estimates the use of corporate investments to fund the two acquisitions reduced investment income by approximately $7.6 million in fiscal 2003.
The effective income tax rate was 32.0% in fiscal 2003 compared with 30.5% in fiscal 2002 and 30.0% in fiscal 2001. The increases in the effective income tax rate are primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities of the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. Fiscal 2004's effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 32.5%.
Despite the impact of lower interest rates and difficult economic conditions, income before taxes was 39% of total revenues during fiscal 2003, compared with 41% in fiscal 2002 and 42% in fiscal 2001. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 16% in fiscal 2003 and 19% in fiscal 2002 to $348.0 million and $301.0 million, respectively.
Outlook
The Company has based its fiscal 2004 expectations on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. For fiscal 2004, the Company projects Payroll service revenue growth in the range of 15% to 17%, reflecting the full-year benefits of the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay, and Human Resource and Benefits service revenue growth in the range of 21% to 23%. Total service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 16% to 18%. The Company expects interest on funds held for clients (including realized gains) to be flat in fiscal 2004 and corporate investment income to be down approximately 45% primarily due to the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions in fiscal 2003.
Taking the factors mentioned above into consideration, the Company anticipates achieving record total revenues and net income for fiscal 2004. Total revenue growth is estimated to be in the range of 15% to 17% (10% to 12% without Advantage and InterPay) accompanied by net income growth of approximately 10%. The impact of lower interest rates will continue to moderate year-over-year growth. In addition, the Company estimates that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of 15% to 20% for fiscal 2004.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has historically funded its operations, capital purchases, purchases of corporate investments, and dividend payments primarily through cash generated from its operating activities. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 were funded entirely by the Company's cash and corporate investments. At May 31, 2003, the Company had $381 million in available cash and corporate investments. Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support normal business operations, purchases of property and equipment, and current dividend payments.
The Company has two available, uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit from various banks totaling $140 million at market rates of interest. The Company also has an available, uncommitted, secured line of credit from a bank totaling $350 million at a market rate of interest. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2003 or at May 31, 2003. At May 31, 2003, the Company had a letter of credit outstanding totaling $7.1 million required by certain PEO workers' compensation insurance policies.
As of May 31, 2003, the Company has contractual obligations under operating lease agreements. Future minimum lease payments under various non-cancelable operating leases with terms of more than one year are as follows:
At May 31, 2003 the Company had outstanding commitments to purchase $6.7 million of capital assets. The Company enters into various purchase commitments with vendors in the ordinary course of business.
Operating activities
The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2003 reflects higher net income and cash provided by working capital. Operating cash flows in fiscal 2002 were comparable with fiscal 2001 as higher net income was offset by higher uses of working capital. The fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of payments for payroll-related, income tax, and other liabilities, and the timing of payments for PEO and PAS payroll liabilities.
 
Investing activities
Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to tax authorities for tax filing and payment service clients and employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relates to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. During fiscal 2003, corporate investments were sold to fund the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
To support the Company's continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2003, the Company made purchases of property and equipment of $60.2 million, compared with $54.4 million of purchases in fiscal 2002 and $45.3 million in fiscal 2001. Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2004 are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. Fiscal 2004 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million.
Purchases of property and equipment:
The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 include the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company placed into service a consolidated data center to enhance data processing and disaster recovery capabilities. Purchases of data processing equipment, software, and building improvements in fiscal 2003 and 2002 for the data center were approximately $12.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively.
 
Financing activities
In October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a 22.2% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.11 per share from $.09 per share. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.09 per share from $.06 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 56%, 57%, and 48% in fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on the Company's future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Dividends paid:
The decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2003 is primarily due to the decrease in number of shares exercised. The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2002 is due to an increase in the number of shares exercised and an increase in the comparable average exercise price per share. Shares exercised in fiscal 2003 were 839,000 compared with 2,212,000 shares in fiscal 2002 and 1,878,000 shares in fiscal 2001. The Company has recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $5.5 million, $24.1 million, and $26.4 million for fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid-in capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes.
Proceeds from exercise of stock options:
Other
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which requires companies to record a liability at fair value for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. This Statement is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2003. The Company does not believe adoption of this Statement will result in a material impact to its results of operations or financial position.
New accounting pronouncements:
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," which provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of. The Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 with no material impact to its results of operations or financial position.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections." SFAS No. 145 clarifies guidance related to the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the required accounting treatment of certain lease modifications. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 with no material impact to its results of operations or financial position.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity," under which a liability is
 
recognized solely based on an entity's commitment to a plan. SFAS No. 146 requires a liability for these costs to be recognized and measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.
SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," establishes accounting and reporting standards for stock-based employee compensation plans. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company accounts for such arrangements under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure." SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the previous disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported financial results and requires these disclosures in interim financial information. The Company continues to account for stock-based employee compensation under APB Opinion 25, but has adopted the new disclosure requirements of SFAS 148 beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003.
Market Risk Factors
Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities, whereas corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. The Company's available-for-sale debt securities are exposed to interest rate risk as interest rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the market value of held investments and the earnings potential of future investments. Increases in interest rates normally decrease the market value of the available-for-sale securities, while decreases in interest rates increase the market value of the available-for-sale securities. The Company's available-for-sale securities and short-term funds are exposed to earnings risk from changes in interest rates, as rate volatility will cause fluctuations in the earnings potential of future investments. Increases in interest rates quickly increase earnings from short-term funds, and over time increase earnings from the available-for-sale securities portfolio. Decreases in interest rates have the opposite earnings effect on the available-for-sale securities and short-term funds. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities do not reflect changes in rates until the investments are sold or mature, and the proceeds are reinvested at current rates. The immediate impact of changing interest rates on earnings from short-term funds may be temporarily offset by realized gains or losses from transactions in the Company's available-for-sale portfolio.
Interest rate risk:
The Company directs investments towards high credit-quality, tax-exempt securities to mitigate the risk that earnings from the portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates in the near term. The Company invests in short- to intermediate-term, fixed-rate municipal and government securities, which typically have lower interest rate volatility, and normally manages the securities portfolio to a benchmark duration of 2.5 to 3.0 years. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
 
The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the last three fiscal years:
Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short- and intermediate-term investments, the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change generally affects the Company's tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
The total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately $2.90 billion in fiscal 2004. The Company's normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 50% invested in short-term securities with a duration of less than 30 days and 50% invested in intermediate-term municipal securities with an average duration of three years. The Company estimates that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at this point in time would be approximately $3.0 million for fiscal 2004.
The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale investment portfolios reflected unrealized gains of $45.0 million at May 31, 2003 compared with $26.7 million at May 31, 2002 and $20.5 million at May 31, 2001. During fiscal 2003, the unrealized gain position ranged from approximately $22.3 million to $49.7 million. The range of unrealized gains in fiscal 2002 was $7.5 million to $35.9 million. As of May 31, 2003 and May 31, 2002, the Company had $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value, with weighted average yields to maturity of 3.1% and 3.6%, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at May 31, 2003 would be approximately $8.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity, and with no related or immediate impact to the results of operations.
The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA and AA rated securities and A-1 rated short-term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At May 31, 2003, available-for-sale and short-term securities held at least an A-1 or equivalent rating, with approximately 99% of available-for-sale securities holding an AA rating or better.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
The registrant's press release dated September 23, 2003, which reports its financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2003, is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ROCHESTER, NY, September 23, 2003  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $80.3 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended August 31, 2003, a 6% increase over net income of $75.9 million, or $.20 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $309.3 million, a 22% increase over $252.7 million for the first quarter last year.
In fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired two payroll service providers servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States. Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") on September 20, 2002 and InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay") on April 1, 2003. The Company's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 include the results of Advantage and InterPay for the entire period. Financial results for the prior year first quarter do not reflect the acquisitions. Advantage and InterPay combined contributed $31.6 million in revenues for the quarter ended August 31, 2003, including service revenues of $29.9 million and interest on funds held for clients of $1.7 million.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended August 31, 2003, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $295.9 million, an increase of 24% over $239.4 million for the prior year quarter.
Payroll service revenue increased 24% for the first quarter to $254.6 million. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) decreased .1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with 1.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, .3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and .1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. An increase in checks per client of .3% occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
As of August 31, 2003, 88% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 61% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 43% for the first quarter to $31.6 million.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue was $41.3 million for the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 22%. The increase is related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services revenue increased 15% in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to $17.9 million.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients was $13.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which is comparable to the fiscal 2003 first quarter. The impact of lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004 was offset by higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances. Higher average portfolio balances were due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and organic client growth. Average portfolio balances for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $2.3 billion compared with $1.9 billion in the prior year quarter. The average interest rate earned by the funds held for clients portfolio was 1.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with 2.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $2.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with net realized gains of $1.6 million for the prior year period.
 
OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 29% in the first quarter over the prior year quarter. The increase is due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. As a result of the acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets increased to $4.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 from $.6 million in the same period last year. For the quarter ended August 31, 2003, operating income was $115.1 million, an increase of 12% over the same period last year.
Operating income growth continues to be negatively impacted by the lower average interest rates earned by the funds held for clients portfolio. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 14% in the first quarter to $101.7 million. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared with 37% for the respective prior year period.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net, decreased 53% for the first quarter to $3.9 million. The decrease is due to lower average portfolio balances from the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions, lower average interest rates earned, and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $386 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with $749 million in the prior year period. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 compared with 3.3% in the prior year period. Net realized gains included in investment income were $1.5 million compared with $2.4 million for the prior year period.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate was 32.5% for the quarter ended August 31, 2003, compared with 31.5% for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and are hopeful that some early signs of improving conditions for small business will continue. The integration of Advantage and InterPay continues to progress as anticipated. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the range of 15% to 17%, accompanied by net income growth of approximately 10%. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of 15% to 20%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

ROCHESTER, NY, December 18, 2003  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $80.7 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended November 30, 2003, an increase of 8% over net income of $74.7 million, or $.20 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $312.1 million, a 16% increase over $268.8 million for the second quarter last year.
For the six months ended November 30, 2003, the Company reported net income of $161.0 million, or $.42 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 7% over net income of $150.6 million, or $.40 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $621.4 million, an increase of 19% over $521.5 million for the same period last year.
In fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired two payroll service providers servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States. Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") on September 20, 2002 and InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay") on April 1, 2003. The Company's results of operations for the first six months of fiscal 2004 include the results of Advantage and InterPay for the entire period. The results for the prior year six-month period include the results of Advantage from the date of acquisition.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended November 30, 2003, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $297.6 million, an increase of 16% over $255.7 million for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended November 30, 2003, service revenues were $593.5 million, an increase of 20% over $495.1 million for the same period last year. The Company estimates that organic service revenue growth was in the range of 11% to 12% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004.
Payroll service revenue increased 16% for the second quarter and 20% for the six-month period to $255.0 million and $509.7 million, respectively. The year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004 were comparable with the prior year periods.
As of November 30, 2003, 88% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 61% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 39% and 41% for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $33.1 million and $64.7 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 19% for the second quarter and 21% for the six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $42.5 million and $83.8 million, respectively. The increases are related primarily to growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. Retirement Services revenue increased 18% and 17% in the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $19.3 million and $37.2 million, respectively.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the second quarter and 6% for the six-month period of fiscal 2004 to $14.5 million and $27.9 million, respectively. The increases in interest on funds held for clients are attributable to higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by
 
lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. Higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and by the growth in the utilization of the Company's tax filing and payment services and employee payment services. Average portfolio balances for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004 were $2.3 billion, compared with $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in the prior year quarter and six-month period. The average interest rate earned on the funds held for clients portfolio was 1.8% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, compared with 2.5% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $4.4 million and $7.1 million for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $.6 million and $2.3 million for the respective prior year periods.
OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 16% in the second quarter and 22% for the six-month period over the prior year periods. The increases are due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. As a result of the acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets increased to $4.2 million and $8.3 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, from $2.2 million and $2.8 million in the respective prior year periods. Operating income increased 16% and 14% in the second quarter and six-month period to $114.8 million and $229.9 million, respectively.
Operating income growth continues to be negatively impacted by the lower average interest rates earned on funds held for clients. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 17% and 15% in the second quarter and six-month period to $100.3 million and $202.0 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% in the second quarter and six-month period, compared with 34% and 35% in the respective prior year periods.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 56% for the second quarter and 54% for the six-month period to $5.1 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The decreases are due to lower average portfolio balances resulting from the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions, lower average interest rates earned, and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $415 million and $400 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, compared with average balances of $512 million and $631 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.5% and 2.7% for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2004, compared with 3.4% in the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in investment income were $2.7 million and $4.2 million for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $7.2 million and $9.6 million for the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rates were 32.7% and 32.6% for the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with 32.5% and 32.0% for the respective prior year periods. The increases in the effective tax rates are the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, which were in line with our expectations. We are hopeful that signs of improving small business conditions will continue. We remain focused on growing our client base and the integration of the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the range of 15% to 17%, accompanied by net income growth in the high single digits. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of 15% to 20%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

ROCHESTER, NY, March 18, 2004  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $80.5 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended February 29, 2004, an increase of 13% over net income of $71.5 million, or $.19 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $342.6 million, a 19% increase over $287.8 million for the third quarter last year.
For the nine months ended February 29, 2004, the Company reported record net income of $241.5 million, or $.64 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 9% over net income of $222.1 million, or $.59 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $964.0 million, an increase of 19% over $809.3 million for the same period last year.
In fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. on September 20, 2002 and InterPay, Inc. on April 1, 2003. The Company's results of operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 include the results of Advantage and InterPay for the entire period, whereas the results for fiscal 2003 only include the results of the acquired companies from their acquisition date to the end of fiscal 2003. Period-over-period increases in revenues and expenses have been affected by the timing of the acquisitions.
For the quarter ended February 29, 2004, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $328.1 million, an increase of 20% over $274.3 million for the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended February 29, 2004, service revenues were $921.6 million, an increase of 20% over $769.4 million for the same period last year. The Company estimates that organic service revenue growth was approximately 13% for the third quarter and approximately 12% for the first nine months of fiscal 2004.
SERVICE REVENUES
Payroll service revenue increased 15% for the third quarter and 18% for the nine-month period to $270.6 million and $780.3 million, respectively. The year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. Checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 were comparable with the prior year period.
As of February 29, 2004, 88% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 62% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 39% and 40% for the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004 to $37.9 million and $102.6 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased to $57.5 million and $141.3 million for the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004, respectively. The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately $6.4 million in net incremental PEO revenue resulting from a refund of PEO workers' compensation insurance premium and a reduction of the estimated claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 insurance policy. Excluding the $6.4 million in net incremental PEO revenue, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 31% for the third quarter and 24% for the nine-month period of fiscal 2004. Retirement Services revenue increased 17% in both the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004 to $20.6 million and $57.9 million, respectively.
 
Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for the third quarter and 6% for the nine-month period of fiscal 2004 to $14.5 million and $42.4 million, respectively. The increases in interest on funds held for clients are attributable to higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. Higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and from organic client growth. Average portfolio balances were $2.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $2.4 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared with $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion in the respective prior year quarter and nine-month period. The average interest rates earned on the funds held for clients portfolio were 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared with 2.1% and 2.4% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $3.5 million and $10.6 million for the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $.7 million and $3.0 million for the respective prior year periods.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 21% for the third quarter and 22% for the nine-month period over the prior year periods. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately $9.2 million to increase reserves for pending legal matters. In addition, the increases are due to the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions and increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. As a result of the acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets increased to $4.1 million and $12.4 million in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004, from $2.8 million and $5.6 million in the respective prior year periods. Operating income increased 15% and 14% in the third quarter and nine-month period to $116.5 million and $346.4 million, respectively.
OPERATING INCOME
Operating income growth continues to be impacted by the lower average interest rates earned on funds held for clients. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 16% and 15% in the third quarter and nine-month period to $102.0 million and $304.0 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 31% and 33% in the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with 32% and 34% in the respective prior year periods.
Investment income, net decreased 16% for the third quarter and 48% for the nine-month period to $3.2 million and $12.2 million, respectively. The decreases are primarily due to lower average portfolio balances resulting from the sale of investments to fund the acquisitions and lower average interest rates earned. For the third quarter, investment income included higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities than in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, whereas the nine-month period reflected lower net realized gains than in the respective fiscal 2003 period. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $466 million and $422 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared with average balances of $495 million and $585 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.2% and 2.5% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004, compared with 3.2% and 3.3% in the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in investment income were $1.0 million and $5.2 million for the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004. There were no net realized gains in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and $9.6 million of net realized gains for the nine-month period of fiscal 2003.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
The effective income tax rates were 32.7% and 32.6% for the third quarter and nine-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with 32.0% for both the respective prior year periods. The increases in the effective tax rates are the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
INCOME TAXES
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2004. We now service over 500,000 clients and remain optimistic that the indicators of improving small business conditions will continue. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2004 is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%, accompanied by net income growth in the range of 8% to 10%. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) will be in the range of 15% to 20%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

ROCHESTER, NY, June 21, 2004  Paychex, Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced a jury finding in Los Angeles Superior Court. As previously disclosed in various filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Company's Fiscal 2003 Annual Report, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("RPI"), are presently defendants in 22 pending lawsuits brought by licensees of payroll processing software licensed by Rapid Payroll, Inc. The licensees assert breach of contract and various tort claims against Rapid Payroll Inc., the Company, and certain of its officers.
On June 18, 2004, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that RPI breached a payroll software license agreement with Payroll Partnership L.P. and two related entities. The jury awarded $6.4 million in damages against RPI. The plaintiffs had asserted claims for fraud and other torts against Paychex and two of its officers, but those claims were dismissed by the court. RPI intends to bring post-trial motions challenging the jury award, and, if necessary, to appeal.
The Company plans to announce fiscal 2004 earnings results after the market closes on June 24, 2004. Subject to a potential increase in the litigation reserve associated with the above matter, the Company results are expected to be in line with the guidance contained in the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 29, 2004.

ROCHESTER, NY, June 24, 2004  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $303.0 million, or $.80 diluted earnings per share, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, an increase of 3% over net income of $293.5 million, or $.78 diluted earnings per share, for the prior fiscal year. Total revenues were $1,294.3 million, an increase of 18% over $1,099.1 million for the same period last year.
For the fourth quarter ended May 31, 2004, the Company reported net income of $61.4 million, or $.16 diluted earnings per share, a decrease of 14% from net income of $71.3 million, or $.19 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $330.4 million, a 14% increase over $289.8 million for the fourth quarter last year.
The fiscal 2004 results were impacted by expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters of Rapid Payroll, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company), which totaled $26.6 million in the fourth quarter and $35.8 million in the twelve-month period. The expense charges reduced diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and the year ended May 31, 2004, by approximately $.04 per share and $.06 per share, respectively.
In fiscal 2003, Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. on September 20, 2002 and InterPay, Inc. on April 1, 2003. The Company's results of operations for fiscal 2004 include the results of Advantage and InterPay for the entire period, whereas the results for fiscal 2003 only include the results of the acquired companies from their acquisition dates to the end of fiscal 2003.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended May 31, 2004, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $318.5 million, an increase of 15% over $276.7 million for the prior year quarter. For the twelve months ended May 31, 2004, service revenues were $1,240.1 million, an increase of 19% over $1,046.0 million for the same period last year. The Company estimates that organic service revenue growth was approximately 15% for the fourth quarter and approximately 13% for the full year fiscal 2004.
Payroll service revenue increased 11% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the twelve-month period to $262.1 million and $1,042.4 million, respectively. The year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from the acquisitions, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases.
As of May 31, 2004, 89% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 63% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 31% and 37% for the fourth quarter and twelve-month period of fiscal 2004 to $37.1 million and $139.7 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased to $56.4 million and $197.7 million for the fourth quarter and twelve-month period of fiscal 2004, year-over-year increases of 41% and 33%, respectively. The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services and in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services, and higher net PEO workers' compensation revenue and workers' compensation Pay-As-You-Go revenue. Retirement Services revenue increased 23% and 18% in the fourth quarter and twelve-month period of fiscal 2004 to $21.1 million and $79.0 million, respectively. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately $6.4 million in net incremental PEO revenue resulting from a refund of PEO workers' compensation insurance premium and a reduction of the estimated claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 insurance policy. Excluding the $6.4 million in net incremental PEO revenue, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 29% for the full year fiscal 2004.
SM
 
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 10% for the fourth quarter and increased 2% for the twelve-month period of fiscal 2004, to $11.9 million and $54.3 million, respectively. The decrease in interest on funds held for clients in the fourth quarter is attributable to lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004 partially offset by higher average portfolio balances in fiscal 2004. The increase in interest on funds held for clients for the full-year period is due to higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. Higher average portfolio balances were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay and from organic client growth. Average portfolio balances were $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and $2.5 billion for the full year fiscal 2004, compared with $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned on the funds held for clients portfolio were 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2004, compared with 1.9% and 2.3% for the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $.9 million and $11.5 million for the fourth quarter and twelve-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $1.0 million and $4.0 million for the respective prior year periods.
OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 27% for the fourth quarter and 23% for the twelve-month period over the prior year periods. The fiscal 2004 periods were impacted by expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters totaling $26.6 million for the fourth quarter and $35.8 million for the twelve-month period. Excluding these amounts, consolidated expenses increased by 13% and 18%, respectively, for the fourth quarter and twelve-month period. These increases are due to the acquisitions and increases in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. As a result of the acquisitions, amortization of intangible assets increased to $4.2 million and $16.6 million in the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2004, from $3.8 million and $9.5 million in the respective prior year periods. Operating income decreased 11% in the fourth quarter to $86.9 million and increased 8% for the twelve-month period to $433.3 million, respectively.
Operating income growth in fiscal 2004 was impacted by lower average interest rates earned on funds held for clients, the $35.8 million of expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters, and the $6.4 million in net incremental PEO revenue. Operating income growth exclusive of interest on funds held for clients and the two unusual items discussed above, was 20% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and 17% for the year ended May 31, 2004.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 38% for the fourth quarter and 46% for the twelve-month period to $4.3 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The decrease in the fourth quarter is primarily due to lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004 and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. The decrease for the twelve-month period is due to lower average portfolio balances resulting from the sale of investments to fund the fiscal 2003 acquisitions, lower interest rates earned in fiscal 2004, and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $521 million and $447 million for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2004, compared with average balances of $434 million and $548 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned on the corporate investment portfolio were 1.9% and 2.3% for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2004, compared with 3.0% and 3.3% in the respective prior year periods. Net realized gains included in investment income were $2.2 million and $7.4 million for the fourth quarter and twelve-month period of fiscal 2004, compared with net realized gains of $4.1 million and $13.7 million for the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rates were 32.7% and 32.6% for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal 2004, compared with 32.0% for both the respective prior year periods. The increases in the effective tax rates are primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 33.0% in fiscal 2005.
B. Thomas Golisano, chairman, president, and chief executive officer of Paychex, said, "We are quite pleased with the accomplishments of fiscal 2004, which produced our fourteenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income. We closed the year with 505,000 clients and we made significant progress on the integration of the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions. Our PAS/PEO product offerings now service well over 150,000 worksite employees. We continue to be optimistic about expectations for the future, and for fiscal 2005, we anticipate total revenue growth will be in the range of 9% to 11%. Operating income growth, excluding interest on funds held for clients, the expense charges related to the pending legal matters, and the net incremental PEO revenue, is expected to be in excess of 15%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

Overview
     Paychex is a leading national provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. The Company has a broad portfolio of products and services that allow its clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. These include payroll processing, tax filing and payment, employee payment, time and attendance systems, regulatory compliance (new-hire reporting and garnishment processing), retirement services administration, employee benefits administration, workers' compensation insurance, and comprehensive bundled human resource administrative services. The Company's strategy is focused on growing its client base, increasing utilization of ancillary services, and leveraging its technological and operating infrastructure. The Company earns its revenues primarily through recurring fees for repetitive services performed related to these products. Service revenues are largely driven by the number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per pay period. The Company also earns interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from clients and remittance to the respective tax agencies or client employees.
     In fiscal 2004, the Company completed its fourteenth consecutive year of record total revenues, net income, and diluted earnings per share. For fiscal 2004, total revenues grew 18% year-over-year to $1,294.3 million. This in turn generated net income of $303.0 million, or $.80 diluted earnings per share. In comparison, revenues for fiscal 2003 increased 15% year-over-year to $1,099.1 million. Net income in fiscal 2003 was $293.5 million, or $.78 diluted earnings per share. Year-over-year growth in net income was 3% and 7% for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Operating income increased 8% year-over-year in fiscal 2004 to $433.3 million, compared with a year-over-year increase in fiscal 2003 of 10% to $401.0 million.
     During fiscal 2004, the Company's results of operations were impacted by expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters of Rapid Payroll, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company). These charges totaled $35.8 million, reflecting $9.2 million recorded in the third quarter and $26.6 million recorded in the fourth quarter. The expense charges reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 by approximately $.06 per share. The fiscal 2004 results of operations were also impacted by approximately $6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue resulting from a refund of PEO workers' compensation insurance premiums and a reduction of the estimated claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 insurance policy, which was recorded in the third quarter.
     The Company's results of operations for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were also impacted by the acquisitions in fiscal 2003 of two payroll service providers servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States. On September 20, 2002, Paychex acquired Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") for $314 million in cash. On April 1, 2003, Paychex acquired InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay") for $182 million in cash. These two acquisitions provided Paychex with over 80,000 new clients. The Company's results of operations for fiscal 2004 include the
 
results of Advantage and InterPay for the entire period. The results of operations for fiscal 2003 include the results of Advantage and InterPay from the respective dates of acquisition. In April 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Stromberg LLC ("Stromberg"), a provider of time and attendance software solutions, for $13.6 million. $12.6 million was paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 with an additional $1.0 million expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The Stromberg acquisition did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the Company for fiscal 2004.
     During fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2004, the Company, and the industry as a whole, experienced lower growth rates as a result of challenging economic conditions and the effect of lower interest rates. The downturn in the economy impacted payroll service revenues as a result of lower checks per client as existing clients reduced their work forces. Checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) decreased 3.0% and .5% year-over-year in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, respectively. For fiscal 2004, checks per client (excluding Advantage and InterPay) were relatively comparable with the prior year period.
     In response to economic conditions, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal Funds rate thirteen times from January 2001 through May 31, 2004 to 1.00%, for a cumulative 550-basis-point reduction. Lower interest rates have adversely impacted income earned on the Company's funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. During the last three fiscal years, the Company was able to offset some of the impact of lower interest rates by realizing gains from the sale of available-for-sale investments in both the client funds and corporate investment portfolios.
     Due to the impact of fluctuations in interest rates earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments, the Company also focuses on operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients in evaluating the results of operations. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients experienced year-over-year growth of 9% in fiscal 2004 and 16% in fiscal 2003, increasing to $379.1 million and $347.9 million, respectively. Operating income was also impacted by the $35.8 million of expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters and the $6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and these two unusual items was $408.5 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of 17% year-over-year.
     Paychex continues to make investments in the business as part of its growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:
      In fiscal 2004, the Company reached a milestone as its client base increased to approximately 505,000 clients at May 31, 2004. This compares with approximately 490,000 clients at May 31, 2003 and over 390,000 clients at May 31, 2002. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 accounted for over 80,000 clients. Year-over-year client growth was approximately 3% for fiscal 2004. Client growth excluding the impact of the acquisitions was approximately 7% for fiscal 2004 and slightly less than 5% for fiscal 2003.
Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services:
     Paychex has continued to invest in its direct sales force as the Company believes there is opportunity for growth within the target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. The approximate composition of the Company's direct sales force is summarized in the following table:
     The Company believes there are opportunities for growth within the current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased utilization of the Company's payroll-related and human resource ancillary services. Ancillary services effectively leverage the payroll processing data, and therefore, are beneficial to the Company's operating margin. Penetration of the Company's tax filing and payment services and employee payment services has
 
continued to increase, and totals 89% and 63%, respectively, at May 31, 2004. Client bases in the human resource and employee benefits areas have continued to grow as shown in the following table:
     During fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, the Company has been integrating Advantage and InterPay into the operations of Paychex. These integration efforts will lead to efficiencies in operations and services provided to clients. By the end of fiscal 2003, the sales forces of these companies were combined with the Paychex sales force, and the responsibility for their operations and corporate support had been integrated into the management structure of Paychex. By the end of fiscal 2004, most branch operations had been integrated into existing Paychex locations. The Company's primary integration focus continues to be on client service and retention. The Advantage payroll system is being retained for the foreseeable future in order to service clients affiliated with independently owned associate offices and Advantage co-branded products. Approximately one-half of the InterPay clients were converted to Paychex software platforms by the end of May 2004, with the remaining clients expected to be converted by December 2004.
Effective integration of acquired businesses:
     The Company has always focused on customer service and minimizing client losses, and in fiscal 2004, client satisfaction survey results improved over fiscal 2003. Client losses, which are slightly higher than 20% of the beginning client base, are near historical lows. The most significant factor contributing to client losses is companies going out of business. In addition, Paychex has invested in efforts to reduce turnover of payroll specialists, who are the primary contact with the clients, through improvements in work processes, technology, and compensation. These efforts have resulted in improvement in retention of payroll specialists.
Focus on customer service:
     Other initiatives during fiscal 2004 include the following:
Other initiatives:
     None of these initiatives, either individually or in the aggregate, had a material impact on the Company's results of operations.
     In fiscal 2003, the Company placed into service a $30 million consolidated data center in Rochester, New York. This data center was designed to enhance data processing and disaster recovery capabilities.
     At May 31, 2004, the Company maintains a strong financial position with total cash and corporate investments of $523.8 million. The Company's primary source of cash is its ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $390.1 million in fiscal 2004 and $373.7 million in fiscal 2003, year-over-year increases of 4% and 23%, respectively. Historically, the Company has funded its operations, capital purchases, purchases of corporate investments, and dividend payments from its operating activities. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and Stromberg in fiscal 2004, were funded from the Company's cash and corporate investments. It is anticipated that current cash and corporate investment balances, along with projected operating cash flows, will support normal business operations, capital purchases, and current dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
 
     For further analysis of the Company's results of operations for fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, and financial position at May 31, 2004, refer to the discussion of "Critical Accounting Policies" and the charts and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review.
Critical Accounting Policies
     The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting policies. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company's management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, PEO workers' compensation insurance, investments, goodwill and intangible assets, fixed assets, potential losses resulting from its clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations, contingencies, allowance for doubtful accounts, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to the Company's results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
     Service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. The Company's service revenues are largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. Paychex provides delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports. The revenue earned from delivery service is included in service revenues, and the costs for delivery are included in operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     Professional Employer Organization (PEO) revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $1,846.1 million, $1,460.7 million, and $1,056.9 million for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected before due dates from clients for payroll tax filing and payment services and employee payment services and invested (funds held for clients) until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities.
     In fiscal 2003, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided under a pre-funded, deductible workers' compensation policy with a national insurance company. Under this policy, the Company's maximum individual claims liability was $250,000 and the aggregate claims exposure was based on a percentage of premium rates as applied to workers' compensation payroll.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Based on claims experience, during the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately $6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue resulting from a refund of insurance premium and a reduction in estimated claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 policy. The fiscal 2004 policy is similar to the fiscal 2003 policy, except that the Company's maximum individual claims liability is $500,000. At May 31, 2004, the Company has recorded $1.8 million in current liabilities for workers' compensation claims cost based on the estimated loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 policy, and an estimated prepayment of $5.0 million under the fiscal 2004 policy in prepaid expenses and other current assets. These estimates may change in the future based on claims experience trends.
     The Company's investments in debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized
Valuation of investments:
 
gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact the Company's net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On the Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
     The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high-credit-quality securities. The Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and its ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of maturity or market price recovery. The Company's assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company's strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
     For business combinations, Paychex assigns estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software, and intangible assets, the Company utilizes the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets:
     The Company has $405.7 million of goodwill recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2004 resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. The Company's business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based on the results of the Company's goodwill impairment review, no impairment charge was recognized. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of the goodwill balance.
     The Company also tests intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
     The carrying value of fixed assets, including costs for acquired software and software developed for internal use, reflects estimates, assumptions, and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful lives, utilization, and salvage value. For software developed for internal use, all external direct costs for materials and services and certain payroll and related fringe costs are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." The Company reviews the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Fixed assets:
     The Company maintains an accrual for estimated losses associated with its clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, tax filing and payment services, and employee payment services, Paychex is authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money funds transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. The Company evaluates certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyzes historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
 
     The Company is subject to various claims and legal matters. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $9.2 million and $26.6 million, respectively, in expense charges to increase its reserves for pending legal matters. At May 31, 2004, the Company has recorded approximately $35.0 million in reserves for pending legal matters based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires the Company to record a reserve if it believes an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. These reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Company's strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the reserves that have been recorded, the Company's management currently believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position and the results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Contingent liabilities:
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
     Details regarding the Company's funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
Revenues:
     Total service revenues are comprised of revenues from the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from payroll processing, tax filing and payment services, employee payment services, and other ancillary services. Human Resource and Benefits service revenues are earned primarily from Retirement Services, Workers' Compensation Insurance Administration, Section 125 Plan Administration, and Paychex Administrative Services and Professional Employer Organization bundled services. The company estimates that year-over-year organic service revenue growth was approximately 13% for fiscal 2004 and approximately 11% for fiscal 2003.
     The increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is due to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay, organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services by both new and existing clients, and price increases. The increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is attributable to the same factors.
     As of May 31, 2004, 89% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services, compared with 87% at May 31, 2003 and 85% at May 31, 2002. The Company believes the client utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is near maturity. The Company's employee payment services were utilized by 63% of its clients at May 31, 2004, compared with 60% at May 31, 2003 and 57% at May 31, 2002. More than 90% of new clients purchase the Company's tax filing and payment services and more than 70% of new clients purchase employee payment services. Major Market Services revenues totaled $139.7 million, $101.7 million, and $71.7 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 37% for fiscal 2004 and 42% for fiscal 2003. Approximately one-third of new Major Market Services clients are
 
conversions from the Company's Core Payroll service.
     The increases in Human Resource and Benefits service revenues in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 are primarily related to increases in the number of clients utilizing Retirement Services products and increases in Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) client employees serviced. Fiscal 2004 also benefited from improving net PEO workers' compensation revenue under the fiscal 2004 insurance policy and higher workers' compensation Pay-As-You-Go revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately $6.4 million of net incremental PEO revenue resulting from a refund of PEO workers' compensation insurance premium and a reduction of the estimated claims loss exposure under the fiscal 2003 insurance policy. Excluding this item, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 29% for fiscal 2004. Retirement Services revenues totaled $79.0 million, $66.7 million, and $56.5 million in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 18% for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. The Company serviced over 29,000 and over 26,000 Retirement Services clients at May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
SM
     The Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) product is a combined package of payroll, employer compliance, employee benefit administration, and risk management outsourcing services designed to make it easier for small businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs. The Company's PEO product provides primarily the same bundled services as the PAS product, but with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the client's employees. The PEO service is available primarily in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have been strong, with administrative fee revenues from these products increasing 34% and 40% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The PAS and PEO products serviced over 157,000 and over 103,000 client employees as of May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is the result of higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2003, interest on funds held for clients declined when compared to fiscal 2002 due to lower average interest rates earned and a decrease in net realized gains, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. The higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were driven by the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and from organic client base growth.
Expenses:
     The following table summarizes total consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses:
     The increases in most expense categories in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were due in part to the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003. This includes the additional investment the Company made in its direct sales force in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003, as it integrated the sales forces of Advantage and InterPay. The remaining increases are primarily due to investments in personnel, information technology, and facility costs to support the organic growth of the Company. At May 31, 2004, the Company had approximately 9,400 employees compared with approximately 8,850 at May 31, 2003 and 7,400 at May 31, 2002.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. In addition to the impact from the acquisitions, depreciation expense in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 was higher due in part to the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York, and the placement of a $30 million consolidated data center into service, both of which occurred during the first half of fiscal 2003. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from the acquisitions. Fiscal 2004's
 
expense growth was also impacted by higher legal and professional service fees. During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded approximately $35.8 million in expense charges to increase reserves for pending legal matters. Excluding this amount, consolidated expenses grew 18% in fiscal 2004.
Operating Income:
     As a result of the above factors, operating income increased 8% and 10% in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 to $433.3 million and $401.0 million, respectively.
Investment Income:
     Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from the Company's cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale investment securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenues. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances, lower average interest rates earned, and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances and lower average interest rates earned, offset by higher net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. The decrease in average daily invested balances in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, and higher realized gains in fiscal 2003 are primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund the Advantage and InterPay acquisitions in fiscal 2003. The Company estimates that year-over-year reductions in investment income due to the use of corporate investments to fund the two acquisitions in fiscal 2003 were approximately $7.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively, in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.
Income Taxes:
     The effective income tax rate was 32.6% in fiscal 2004, compared with 32.0% in fiscal 2003 and 30.5% in fiscal 2002. The increases in the effective income tax rate are primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. Fiscal 2005's effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 33.0%.
Outlook
     The Company's current outlook for the full year fiscal 2005 is summarized as follows:
     These projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     At May 31, 2004, the Company's principal source of liquidity was $523.8 million of cash and corporate investment balances. Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support normal business operations, purchases of property and equipment, and current dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     The Company has unused borrowing capacity available under three uncommitted, short-term lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows:
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to client fund deposit obligations or to fund normal business operations, if necessary. The secured line of credit is collateralized primarily by securities in the Company's investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2004 or at May 31, 2004.
     At May 31, 2004, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $8.4 million required to secure commitments under certain insurance policies. These letters of credit expire at various dates between December 2004 and December 2005.
     At May 31, 2004, the Company has recorded $1.0 million in other current liabilities for additional purchase price expected to be paid for the Stromberg acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
     The Company has entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2004. The table below summarizes the Company's estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2004:
 
     Paychex, through it's acquisition of Advantage, has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices, which are responsible for selling and marketing the Company's payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex provides all centralized back-office payroll processing and tax filing services. In addition, the Company has a relationship with NEBS ("New England Business Service, Inc.") whereby Paychex performs all client functions other than sales and marketing. Under these arrangements, Paychex pays the Associates and NEBS commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments is uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates and NEBS in fiscal 2004 was $14.4 million.
     In the normal course of business, the Company makes representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of the Company's services under service arrangements with clients. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, which require the Company to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services to Paychex and its subsidiaries. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of its ongoing business, Paychex does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2004 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, offset by cash used by working capital. The increase in operating cash flows in fiscal 2003 is due to higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and cash provided by working capital. The increases in non-cash adjustments to net income are primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization on fixed and intangible assets. In fiscal 2004, non-cash adjustments to net income were also impacted by $35.8 million in expense charges to increase reserves for pending legal matters. The fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
 
Investing Cash Flow Activities
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
     The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to tax authorities for tax filing and payment services, and employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. During fiscal 2003, corporate investments were sold to fund the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     In fiscal 2004, the Company paid approximately $12.6 million in cash for the acquisition of Stromberg and $.6 million of additional purchase price related to the InterPay acquisition. In fiscal 2003, the company paid $314.4 million in cash for the acquisition of Advantage and $181.7 million in cash for the acquisition of InterPay.
Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired:
     To support the Company's continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2004, the Company made purchases of property and equipment of $50.6 million, compared with $60.2 million of purchases in fiscal 2003, and $54.4 million in fiscal 2002. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 include the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company placed into service a consolidated data center to enhance data processing and disaster recovery capabilities. Purchases of data processing equipment, software, and building improvements in fiscal 2003 and 2002 for the data center were approximately $12.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively. Construction in progress totaled $10.9 million and $5.0 million at May 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts primarily represent costs for software being developed for internal use.
Purchases of property and equipment:
     During fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, the Company purchased approximately $1.2 million, $2.6 million, and $11.2 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors of Paychex.
     Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2005 are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million. The expected increase in fiscal 2005 capital expenditures reflects higher anticipated purchases for printing equipment, communication system upgrades, and branch expansions. Fiscal 2005 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million. In addition, the Company projects amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2005 to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million.
 
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     In October 2003, the Board of Directors approved a 9.1% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.12 per share from $.11 per share. In October 2001, the Board of Directors approved a 22.2% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $.11 per share from $.09 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 59%, 56%, and 57% in fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on the Company's future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.
Dividends paid:
     The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to an increase in both the average exercise price per share and the number of shares exercised. The decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is due to a decrease in the number of shares exercised. Shares exercised in fiscal 2004 were 1.3 million compared with .8 million shares in fiscal 2003, and 2.2 million shares in fiscal 2002. The Company has recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $10.2 million, $5.5 million, and $24.1 million for fiscal 2004, fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2002, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid-in capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes.
Proceeds from exercise of stock options:
Other
     In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," which requires companies to record a liability at fair value for asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. This Statement was effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning June 1, 2003. The Company adopted this Statement in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 with no material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
New accounting pronouncements:
     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." A variable interest entity is an entity that has: (1) an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity's losses; (2) equity owners that do not have voting rights; or (3) equity that does not absorb the entity's losses or residual returns. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entity's activities, or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns, or both. For Paychex, the effective date for application of FIN 46 to variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003 was the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company has investments in various U.S. real estate partnership arrangements, which provide income tax credits for the Company. These partnerships have been determined to be variable interest entities as defined by FIN 46. At May 31, 2004, the Company's net invested equity in these partnerships was approximately $6.1 million. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships, and as such, the Company's adoption of FIN 46 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
     In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This Statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative under SFAS No. 133, and clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows. SFAS No. 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company currently does not utilize derivative instruments, and therefore, the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.
 
     In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity," which establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 was effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The Company currently does not issue financial instruments covered within the scope of SFAS No. 150, and therefore, the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on its results of operations or financial position.
Market Risk Factors
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities, and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of the Company's longer-term available-for-sale investments. The Company generally directs investments towards high-credit-quality, fixed-rate municipal and government securities and manages the available-for-sale portfolio to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     The Company's investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the decreasing interest rate environment, as the Federal Funds rate decreased from 6.50% at the end of fiscal 2000 to the current rate of 1.00%. The decreasing interest rate environment has negatively affected net income growth in fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, and generated significant unrealized gains for the Company's longer-term available-for-sale portfolio during most of the same periods. The Company has mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sale of investments. When interest rates begin to rise, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as discussed below.
     Increases in interest rates increase earnings from the Company's short-term investments, which totaled approximately $1.5 billion at May 31, 2004, and over time will increase earnings from the Company's longer-term available-for-sale investments, which totaled approximately $1.4 billion at May 31, 2004. Earnings from the available-for-sale-investments, which currently have an average duration of 2.1 years, will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates. An increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair value of Company's investment portfolio.
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the last three fiscal years:
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short-term and available-for-sale investments, the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change generally affects the Company's tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     The total investment portfolio is expected to average approximately $3.3 billion in fiscal 2005. The Company's
 
normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60% invested in short-term securities with an average duration of thirty days and 40% invested in available-for-sale municipal securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years. The Company estimates that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at this point in time would be in the range of $3.5 million to $4.0 million for fiscal 2005.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized loss of $4.2 million at May 31, 2004, compared with net unrealized gains of $45.0 million at May 31, 2003 and $26.7 million at May 31, 2002. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, interest rates on longer-term securities began to increase while short-term rates remained fairly consistent. The three-year "AAA" municipal securities yield increased to 2.50% at May 31, 2004 from 1.58% at February 29, 2004. This trend in longer-term interest rates resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the Company's investment portfolios, as the Company's $25.0 million net unrealized gain position at February 29, 2004 changed to a $4.2 million net unrealized loss position at May 31, 2004. During fiscal 2004, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately $7.6 million net unrealized loss to $49.6 million net unrealized gain. The range of unrealized gains in fiscal 2003 was $22.3 million net unrealized gain to $49.7 million net unrealized gain. The net unrealized loss position of the Company's investment portfolios was approximately $6.8 million at June 21, 2004.
     As of May 31, 2004 and May 31, 2003, the Company had $1.4 billion invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value, with weighted average yields to maturity of 2.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for the portfolio of securities at May 31, 2004 would be in the range of $7.0 million to $7.5 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity, and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations.
     The Company is exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. The Company attempts to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA- and AA-rated securities and A-1-rated short-term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At May 31, 2004, all available-for-sale and short-term securities classified as cash equivalents held an A-1 or equivalent rating, with over 99% of available-for-sale securities holding an AA rating or better.

ROCHESTER, NY, September 21, 2004  Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $87.7 million, or $.23 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended August 31, 2004, a 9% increase over net income of $80.3 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter last year. Total revenues were $345.0 million, a 12% increase over $309.3 million for the prior year first quarter.
SERVICE REVENUES
For the quarter ended August 31, 2004, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $334.2 million, an increase of 13% over $295.9 million for the prior year first quarter.
Payroll service revenue increased 10% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to $280.4 million. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. As of August 31, 2004, 89% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 63% utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 30% for the first quarter to $41.0 million.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased to $53.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, a year-over-year increase of 30%. The increase reflects growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg Time and Attendance products. Retirement Services revenue increased 17% year-over-year in the first quarter to $20.9 million. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 48% in the first quarter to $16.0 million.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 19% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to $10.8 million, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The decrease was attributable to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by higher average portfolio balances resulting from client base growth. Average portfolio balances for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $2.5 billion compared with $2.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The average interest rates earned by the funds held for clients portfolio were 1.7% for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with 1.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients were $.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with net realized gains of $2.7 million for the prior year period.
CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 11% in the first quarter over the prior year quarter. The increase is due to increases in personnel, information technology, and other costs to support the organic growth of the Company. Higher professional services expenses related to pending legal matters also contributed to the increase in the first quarter.
For the quarter ended August 31, 2004, operating income was $128.7 million, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Operating income growth continues to be impacted by the lower average interest rates earned by the funds held for clients portfolio. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 16% year-over-year in the first quarter to $117.9 million. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of
 
total service revenues was 35% for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with 34% for the respective prior year period.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net, decreased 43% year-over-year in the first quarter to $2.3 million, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The decrease is due to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $529 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with $386 million in the prior year period. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 1.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with 2.8% in the prior year period. There were no net realized gains included in investment income in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared with $1.5 million in the prior year period.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rate was 33.0% for the quarter ended August 31, 2004, compared with 32.5% for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate is the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and corporate investments.
B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, said, "Fiscal 2005 is off to a good start as our financial results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, and improving our profit margins. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2005 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%, accompanied by net income growth in the range of 16% to 18%. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income, excluding interest on funds held for clients, expense charges in fiscal 2004 for pending legal matters, and the net incremental PEO revenue benefit recognized in fiscal 2004, to be in excess of 15%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

     (a) See the information disclosed in Item 5.02 below, which is incorporated herein by reference thereto.
     (b) B. Thomas Golisano has retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex, Inc., which he founded in 1979. On October 1, 2004, Mr. Golisano tendered his resignation as President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex effective immediately. Mr. Golisano will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Paychex.
     (c) On October 1, 2004, the Paychex Board of Directors appointed Jonathan J. Judge as President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. From October 2002 through December 2003, Mr. Judge served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Crystal Decisions, Inc. in Palo Alto, California, a leading maker of information management software, where he was responsible for the overall operations and management of Crystal Decisions' business, including product development, customer satisfaction and partner relationship programs. Crystal Decisions was acquired by Business Objects, S.A., a French company, in December 2003. From 2001 to 2002, Mr. Judge was General Manager of IBM's Personal Computing Division, a $10 billion business unit offering a broad range of products, services and solutions, including IBM's ThinkPad brand of mobile computers. From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Judge headed up the worldwide sales, service and support functions of IBM's Personal Computing Division and was a member of the worldwide management committee of IBM. Prior thereto, Mr. Judge held various sales, marketing and management positions with IBM. Mr. Judge, age 50, serves on the Board of Directors of PMC-Sierra, Inc. (NASDAQ:PMCS), a leading provider of high-speed broadband communications and storage semiconductors and MIPS-based microprocessors located in Santa Clara, California.
     On October 1, 2004, the Paychex Board of Directors approved an employment agreement ("Agreement") between Paychex and Mr. Judge. The Agreement contemplates that Mr. Judge will be elected to the Paychex Board of Directors following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on October 6, 2004. Mr. Judge's initial base salary will be $800,000, subject to annual review and increase (but not decrease) by the Board of Directors. He will be eligible for a cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% of his base salary, based on achievement of certain operating and qualitative objectives, which will be prorated for the current fiscal year.
     The Agreement provides that Mr. Judge will be granted, effective October 1, 2004, ten-year options to purchase 650,000 shares of Paychex common stock at their fair market value on the grant date. The options will vest in accordance with the standard Paychex stock option vesting policy, under which one-third of the options vest on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third will vest on each of the third and fourth
 
     anniversaries of the grant date, except that they will become 100% vested and subject to a one-year post-termination exercise period in the event of termination of Mr. Judge's employment by Paychex without "Cause" (as defined in the Agreement) or by Mr. Judge for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Agreement).

The registered office of Paychex, Inc., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter referred to as the "Corporation"), shall be located within the State of Delaware. SECTION 2. The Corporation may also have offices at such places, either within or without the State of Delaware and either within or without the United States of America, as the board of directors may from time to time designate or the business of the Corporation may require. ARTICLE II MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS SECTION 1. All meetings of the stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such time and place, either within or without the State of Delaware and either within or without the United States of America, as shall be stated in the notice of meeting or in a duly executed waiver thereof. SECTION 2. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date and at such hour as shall be designated each year by the board of directors. At such annual meeting, the stockholders shall elect a board of directors and transact such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting. SECTION 3. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the board of directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning a majority in amount of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting.
SECTION 4. Except as otherwise expressly required by statute, written notice of each annual and special meeting of stockholders, stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. Notice shall be given personally or by mail and, if by mail, shall be sent in a postage prepaid envelope, addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Notice by mail shall be deemed given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such person attends the meeting in person or by proxy for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. A written waiver of notice signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, an annual or special meeting of stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. SECTION 5. The officer who has charge of the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at the time and in the manner required by applicable law, a list of stockholders entitled to vote and shall make such list available for such purposes, at such places, at such times and to such persons as required by applicable law. The stock transfer books shall be the only evidence as to the identity of the stockholders entitled to examine the stock transfer books or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. SECTION 6. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of stockholders, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Corporation's certificate of incorporation. The stockholders present and entitled to vote at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders entitled to vote to leave less than a quorum then present and represented provided that the action taken (other than an adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the holders of stock required to constitute a quorum. Any stockholders' meeting, annual or special, whether or not a quorum is present or represented, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock entitled to vote thereat, the holders of which are either present in person or represented by proxy, or the chairman of the meeting, but in the absence of a quorum no other business may be transacted at such meeting. At any adjourned meeting, at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified, except for such business as was duly transacted at any 2
earlier meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after adjournment a new record date is set, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. SECTION 7. At each meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board or, in his absence or inability to act, such other person as the board of directors may have designated shall call to order and act as chairman of the meeting.

SECTION 8. The order of business and the procedure at all meetings of the stockholders shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting, unless otherwise prescribed by law or regulation. SECTION 9. Except as otherwise provided by statute or the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, each holder of common stock of the Corporation shall be entitled at each meeting of stockholders to one (1) vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on the record of stockholders of the Corporation (a) on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 of Article V of these by-laws as the record date for the determination of the stockholders who shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting; or (b) if no such record date shall have been so fixed, then at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice thereof shall be given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a proxy signed by such stockholder or his attorney-in-fact, but no proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Any such proxy shall be delivered to the secretary of the meeting at or prior to the time designated in the order of business for so delivering such proxies. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, present in person or represented by proxy, shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of statute or of the Corporation's certificate of incorporation or of these by-laws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. On a vote by ballot, each ballot shall be signed by the stockholder voting, or by his proxy, if represented by proxy, and shall state the number of shares voted. 3
SECTION 10. The board of directors may, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at, and make a written report of, such meeting or any adjournment thereof. If any of the inspectors so appointed shall fail to appear or act, the chairman of the meeting shall, or, if inspectors shall not have been appointed, the chairman of the meeting may, appoint one or more inspectors. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. The inspectors shall determine the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power thereof, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies, certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and shall receive votes or ballots, hear, determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of, all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes or ballots, determine the results and perform such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders. If more than one inspector has been appointed, the decision, act or certificate of a majority of the inspectors is effective in all respects as the decision, act or certificate of all of the inspectors. On request of the chairman of the meeting, the inspector shall make a report in writing of any challenge, request or matter determined by them and shall execute a certificate of any fact found by them. No director or candidate for the office of director shall act as an inspector of election with respect to an election of directors. Inspectors need not be stockholders. SECTION 11. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Where corporate action is taken in such manner by less than unanimous written consent, prompt written notice of the taking of such action shall be given to all stockholders who have not consented in writing thereto. Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by statute to the Corporation, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. 4

The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the board of directors.

A written waiver of notice signed by a director, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice to such director.

SECTION 8. At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the total number of directors shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and, except as otherwise expressly required by statute or the Corporation's certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors.

Notice of the time and place of any such adjourned meeting shall be given to all of the directors unless such time and place were announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken, in which case such notice shall only be given to the directors who were not present thereat. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. The directors shall act only as a board and the individual directors shall have no power as such. SECTION 9. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice of his resignation to the Corporation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein or, if the time when it shall become effective shall not be specified therein, immediately upon its tender.

Any vacancy in the board of directors caused by such resignation may be filled by a majority vote of the board of directors for the unexpired portion of the term. SECTION 10. Any director of the Corporation may be removed, at any time, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, and any vacancy in the board of directors caused by any such removal may be filled by the stockholders at said meeting in which the vacancy is created or, if not so filled, by a majority vote of the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term. SECTION 11. Unless restricted by the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, the board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the entire board of directors, designate one or more committees, including an executive committee, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the Corporation.

SECTION 13. Any one or more members of the board of directors or any committee of the board of directors may participate in a meeting of the board of directors or such committee by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. SECTION 14. A director of the Corporation who is present at a meeting of the board of directors or any committee thereof at which action is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his dissent or abstention there from shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file a written dissent from such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation within five days after the date a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received.

Persons whose stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation he has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent and vote such stock. 11

SECTION 8. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its records as the owner of shares of stock to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its records as the owner of shares of stock, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares of stock on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE VI INDEMNIFICATION SECTION 1. To the full extent authorized by law, the Corporation shall indemnify any person made, or threatened to be made, a party in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is serving or served any other corporation, or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, in any such capacity at the request of the Corporation ("indemnitee") against expenses (including attorneys' and other fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. SECTION 2. Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by an indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon an undertaking 12
by or on behalf of such indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined, by final judicial decision from which there is no further right of appeal, that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. To be entitled to such advancement of expenses, the indemnitee shall cooperate in good faith with any request by the Corporation that common counsel be used by parties to such action or proceeding who are similarly situated unless it would be inappropriate to do so because of actual or potential conflicts between the interests of such parties. SECTION 3. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized by the board of directors, grant rights of indemnification and advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the full extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

ARTICLE VII GENERAL PROVISIONS SECTION 1. Subject to the provisions of law and the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, dividends upon the shares of capital stock of the Corporation may be declared by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting.

EXHIBIT 99.1: PRESS RELEASE OF PAYCHEX, INC. DATED OCTOBER 4, 2004 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE --------------------- PAYCHEX FOUNDER B. THOMAS GOLISANO TURNS OVER HIS POSITION AS PRESIDENT AND CEO TO SUCCESSOR, REMAINS AS CHAIRMAN LONGTIME IBM EXECUTIVE JONATHAN JUDGE TO SUCCEED GOLISANO Rochester, NY (October 4, 2004) - Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced that the company's founder, B. Thomas Golisano, is turning over his position as president and chief executive officer of the leading national payroll and human resource services provider to his newly named successor. Golisano will remain as chairman of the Paychex Board of Directors. Longtime IBM executive Jonathan J. Judge immediately succeeds Golisano as Paychex president and CEO. Judge, a 25-year veteran of IBM, left in 2002 to become president and CEO of Crystal Decisions, Inc., a world leader in information management software. "This is an excellent time to make this transition. Paychex is well-positioned, well-managed and continues to have enormous potential," said Golisano. "There is a large untapped market for payroll outsourcing in the United States, and Paychex has the products to meet the needs of U.S. businesses. Significant growth is being generated by our Major Market Services products, which provide payroll and HR services to larger companies, and Paychex Administrative Services, which provides comprehensive payroll, benefits and risk management services. The growth of our other Human Resource Services products and our initial expansion into Europe also add to our potential in the years to come. Combined with a strong balance sheet, including $600 million in cash and no debt, the future is very bright indeed." Golisano said, "Paychex has been fortunate to find a new CEO and president with the experience and qualifications of Jonathan Judge. He is an excellent fit with the current Paychex executive group, and we are definitely strengthening the management team. Jon's leadership qualities and work history demonstrate his abilities. He has successfully managed large groups of employees and over $10 billion in annual revenues. I look forward to working with him as the new CEO and have great confidence in the future successes he will bring to Paychex." Prior to leaving IBM, Judge was general manager of IBM's Personal Computing Division, a $10 billion business unit with 11,000 employees. Judge joined Crystal Decisions as CEO in 2002. In that role, he successfully succeeded the company's founder. Judge enjoyed his position as CEO at Crystal Decisions, but his job was effectively eliminated when he and the management team chose to merge the company with Business Objects, a leader in business intelligence, rather than taking Crystal Decisions public via an IPO. -More-
New Paychex President & CEO Page 2 of 3 October 4, 2004 "I am excited to join a company with the exceptional resources of Paychex, and I look forward to being part of its great management team," said Judge. "Paychex has a tradition of strong year-over-year growth and record performances, and my role will be to continue that legacy." Golisano, 62, said that in addition to maintaining his role as chairman of Paychex, he has a number of other activities he plans to pursue. "I am in great health and have many interests including other entrepreneurial opportunities, philanthropic endeavors, and a desire for political reform in New York State," said Golisano. "I recently got married, have two children and six grandchildren, and I want to spend more time with them."

The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by the Company's comprehensive Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance products. Retirement Services revenue increased 17% in both the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $22.5 million and $43.4 million, respectively. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 42% in the second quarter and 45% in the six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $16.5 million and $32.5 million, respectively.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 15% for the second quarter and 17% for the six-month period of fiscal 2005 to $12.4 million and $23.2 million, respectively, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The decreases are attributable to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from client base growth. Average portfolio balances for both the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005 were $2.4 billion, compared with $2.3 billion in both the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned by the funds held for clients portfolio were 2.0% for the second quarter and 1.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 1.8% for the respective periods of fiscal 2004. There were no net realized gains included in interest on funds held for clients for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and $.2 million for the six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with net realized gains of $4.4 million and $7.1 million for the respective prior year periods.
 
CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12% in both the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005 over the prior year periods. The increases are due to increases in personnel, information technology, and other costs to support the organic growth of the Company. Higher professional services expenses related to pending legal matters also contributed to the increases in consolidated expenses for both the second quarter and six-month period.
Operating income increased 11% in both the second quarter and six-month period to $126.9 million and $255.6 million, respectively. Operating income growth continues to be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates earned and realized gain comparisons in the funds held for clients investment portfolio. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) increased 14% and 15% year-over-year in the second quarter and six-month period to $114.5 million and $232.4 million, respectively. Operating income (excluding interest on funds held for clients) as a percentage of total service revenues was 34% for the second quarter and 35% for the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 34% for both the respective prior year periods.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 46% for the second quarter and 44% for the six-month period to $2.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, which was consistent with the Company's expectations. The decreases are due to lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by higher average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $557 million and $544 million for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with average balances of $415 million and $400 million in the respective prior year periods. The average interest rates earned for the corporate investment portfolio were 2.0% for the second quarter and 1.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2005, compared with 2.5% and 2.7% in the respective prior year periods. There were no net realized gains included in investment income in the second quarter or six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with $2.7 million and $4.2 million in the respective prior year periods.
INCOME TAXES
The effective income tax rates were 33.0% for both the second quarter and six-month period of fiscal 2005, compared with 32.7% and 32.6% for the respective prior year periods.
Jonathan J. Judge, president and chief executive officer of Paychex, said, "We are pleased with our financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2005, which were in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, and improving our profit margins. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2005 is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%, accompanied by net income growth in the range of 16% to 18%. In addition, we expect that growth in operating income, excluding interest on funds held for clients, expense charges in fiscal 2004 for pending legal matters, and the net incremental PEO revenue benefit recognized in fiscal 2004, will approximate 15%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.
     On January 31, 2005, Paychex of New York LLC (the "Borrower"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Registrant, entered into four uncommitted, secured credit arrangements (the "Credit Facilities") with the following financial institutions (the "Lenders") in the following amounts:
     The Credit Facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between Borrower and each of the Lenders, pursuant to which the Borrower has granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders. Borrower's obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by Registrant and certain of its subsidiaries.
     No borrowings were made or are currently planned to be made under the Credit Facilities. It is intended that the primary uses of the Credit Facilities would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary.
     Prior to entering into the Credit Facilities, Borrower maintained a $350 million uncommitted, secured line of credit with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a $150 million uncommitted, unsecured line of credit with Fleet National Bank, and a $100 million uncommitted, unsecured line of credit with PNC Bank, National Association, each of which has been terminated. The increase in the lines of credit relates to higher volumes of electronic payments made on behalf of clients.
     In the event that borrowings are made under the Credit Facilities, the maturity date and applicable interest rate would be determined at the time of borrowing.

ROCHESTER, NY, March 21, 2005  Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $92.8 million, or $.24 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended February 28, 2005, an increase of 15% over net income of $80.5 million, or $.21 diluted earnings per share, from the prior year third quarter. Total revenues for the three months ended February 28, 2005 were $373.9 million, a 9% increase over $342.6 million from the prior year third quarter.
For the nine months ended February 28, 2005, the Company reported net income of $267.4 million, or $.70 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 11% over net income of $241.5 million, or $.64 diluted earnings per share, from the same period last year. Total revenues were $1,066.1 million, an increase of 11% over $964.0 million from the same period last year.
"We have, once again, experienced record financial results for the quarter and for the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Our financial results remain in line with our expectations," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our focus continues to be on growth in our client base - both through adding new clients and selling our ancillary services into the base. We were also pleased to see our first significant increase in interest on funds held for clients since fiscal 2001. We expect the full year fiscal 2005 to be another year of record revenues and net income. Estimated total revenue growth for fiscal 2005 is expected to be near the upper end of 9% to 11%, and we expect the total revenue growth to be accompanied by net income growth in the range of 17% to 19%. These expectations are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes."
SERVICE REVENUES
For the three months ended February 28, 2005, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $357.1 million, an increase of 9% over $328.1 million from the prior year third quarter. For the nine months ended February 28, 2005, service revenues were $1,026.2 million, an increase of 11% over $921.6 million from the same period last year.
Payroll service revenue increased 8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 9% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 to $292.0 million and $851.0 million, respectively. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. The growth rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was impacted by one less calendar billing day than in the prior year third quarter. Due to one additional calendar billing day in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, there was no impact for the nine months of fiscal 2005 as compared to same period last year. As of February 28, 2005, 90% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 65% of all clients utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 25% and 27% for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 to $47.3 million and $130.8 million, respectively.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 13% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 24% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 to $65.1 million and $175.2 million, respectively. The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by Paychex Administrative Services (PAS) and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance products.
Retirement Services revenue increased 17% in both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005 from the same periods last year to $24.0 million and $67.5 million, respectively. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 32% in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 40% in the nine months of fiscal 2005 from the same periods last year to $16.9 million and $49.4 million, respectively. PEO workers' compensation revenue was affected by refunds of PEO workers' compensation insurance premiums and reductions in the estimated claim loss exposure related
 
to prior year periods. Excluding total PEO revenue, Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 25% and 28% for the three and nine month periods of fiscal 2005, respectively, from the same periods last year.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $16.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2005, but decreased 6% to $39.9 million for the nine months of fiscal 2005. The increase in interest on funds held for clients for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 is attributable to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from client base growth, partially offset by a decrease in net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities. The decrease in interest on funds held for clients for the nine months of fiscal 2005 is primarily attributable to lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances. Average portfolio balances were $3.0 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and $2.6 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion for the respective periods last year. The average interest rate earned by the funds held for clients portfolio was 2.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with 1.6% and 1.8% for the respective periods last year. Included in interest on funds held for clients were $0.1 million net realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and $0.1 million of net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities for the nine months of fiscal 2005. This compared with net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities of $3.5 million and $10.6 million for the respective periods last year.
CONSOLIDATED EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME
Consolidated operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 9% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 over the same periods last year. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded $9.2 million of expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters. Consolidated expenses, excluding the reserve for pending legal matters, increased by 10% and 11%, respectively, for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005. These increases are primarily the result of increases in personnel, information technology, and other costs incurred to support organic growth, and the additional expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition of Stromberg in April 2004.
Operating income increased 16% to $135.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 13% to $390.9 million in the nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, from the same periods last year. Operating income growth is impacted by fluctuations in interest rates earned and net realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities in the funds held for clients' investment portfolio.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net decreased 2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 33% for the nine months of fiscal 2005 to $3.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively. The decreases in fiscal 2005 are primarily attributable to lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average portfolio balances. The nine months of fiscal 2005 was also impacted by lower average interest rates earned. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $614 million and $567 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2005, respectively, compared with average portfolio balances of $466 million and $422 million in the respective periods last year. The average interest rate earned for the corporate investment portfolio was 2.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with 2.2% and 2.5% in the respective periods last year. There were no net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities in the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with net realized gains of $1.0 million and $5.2 million in the respective periods last year.
INCOME TAXES
The Company's effective income tax rates were 33.0% for both the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2005, compared with 32.7% and 32.6% for the respective periods last year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ROCHESTER, NY, June 27, 2005  Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $101.4 million for the three months ended May 31, 2005 (the "fourth quarter") compared to net income of $61.4 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter from $0.16 per share for the same period last year. These increases were primarily driven by an increase of 15% in total revenues to $379.0 million for the fourth quarter from $330.4 million for the same period last year.
For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 ("fiscal 2005"), the Company reported net income of $368.8 million, or $0.97 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 22% over net income of $303.0 million, or $0.80 diluted earnings per share for the prior fiscal year. Total revenues were $1,445.1 million, an increase of 12% over $1,294.3 million for the prior fiscal year.
The year-over-year growth rates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2005 were due to strong service revenue growth of 12% and the impact of expense charges recorded in the prior fiscal year that related to pending legal matters. These expense charges resulted in a reduction of diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended May 31, 2004 ("fiscal 2004") of approximately $0.04 per share and $0.06 per share, respectively.
"Fiscal 2005 represents our fifteenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income and I am pleased to report that we exceeded our revenue and net income expectations," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "With over 522,000 clients, we continue to grow our ancillary products and experience organic growth in our Payroll service offering. We also began to see the first significant increase in interest earned on funds held for clients since fiscal 2001, as a result of recent steady increases in interest rates. As we begin the year, we expect total revenue growth for fiscal 2006 to be in the range of 11% to 12%. Assuming no change to interest rates, we expect net income growth in the range of 18% to 20%. Excluding the impact of the additional legal charge, net income growth was 14% in fiscal 2005 and 11% in fiscal 2004. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth in fiscal 2006, and we remain committed to our tradition of excellence and professionalism to benefit our clients, our employees and our shareholders."
SERVICE REVENUES
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, service revenues, which include the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines, were $358.5 million, an increase of 12% over $318.5 million for the same period last year. For fiscal 2005, service revenues were $1,384.7 million, an increase of 12% over $1,240.1 million for the prior fiscal year.
Payroll service revenue increased 9% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 to $285.8 million and $1,136.8 million, respectively, from the same periods last year. Positive year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenue resulted from organic client base growth, increased utilization of ancillary services, and price increases. As of May 31, 2005, 90% of all clients utilized the Company's tax filing and payment services and 65% of all clients utilized employee payment services. Major Market Services revenue increased 26% and 27% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 to $46.9 million and $177.7 million, respectively, from the same periods last year.
Human Resource and Benefits service revenue increased 28% and 25% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 to $72.7 million and $247.9 million, respectively, from the same periods last year. The increases reflect growth in clients for Retirement Services, growth in client employees served by the Company's Paychex Administrative Services ("PAS") and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") bundled services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance products.
 
Retirement Services revenue increased 14% and 17% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 to $23.9 million and $91.4 million, respectively, from the same periods last year. Administrative fee revenue from PAS and PEO products increased 36% and 39% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 to $19.4 million and $68.8 million, respectively, from the same periods last year.
INTEREST ON FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS
Interest on funds held for clients increased 73% and 11% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 to $20.5 million and $60.4 million, respectively, from the same periods last year. The increases in interest on funds held for clients are primarily attributable to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances. The average interest rate earned on funds held for clients was 2.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2.2% for fiscal 2005, compared with 1.5% and 1.7% for the same periods last year. Average portfolio balances were $3.1 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and $2.8 billion for fiscal 2005, compared with $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion for the same periods last year. Partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities. Net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 were $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, compared with net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities of $0.9 million and $11.7 million for the same periods last year. Refer to the Company's Form 8-K filed today for further discussion on interest rate expectations for fiscal 2006.
TOTAL EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME
Total operating, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and increased 6% for fiscal 2005 over the same periods last year. During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters of $26.6 million for the fourth quarter and $35.8 million for the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 total expenses, excluding the reserve for pending legal matters, increased by 9% and 10%, respectively. These increases are primarily the result of investments in personnel, information technology, and other costs to support organic growth, and additional expenses as a result of the Company's April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg LLC.
Operating income increased 64% to $142.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 23% to $533.8 million for fiscal 2005, respectively, from the same periods last year. Operating income growth in fiscal 2005 was impacted by the $35.8 million expense charge for the reserve for pending legal matters in fiscal 2004, net incremental PEO revenue of $6.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $6.4 million in fiscal 2004, and $3.2 million of expense charges related to the Company's captive insurance company in fiscal 2005. Operating income exclusive of interest on funds held for clients and these unusual items increased approximately 18% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and approximately 15% for fiscal 2005.
INVESTMENT INCOME, NET
Investment income, net, earned on the corporate investment portfolio was unchanged for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 at $4.3 million and decreased 25% for fiscal 2005 to $12.4 million from the same periods last year. The decreases in fiscal 2005 are primarily attributable to lower net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by higher average portfolio balances. The fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 was also impacted by lower average interest rates earned on long-term investments. Average portfolio balances for the corporate investment portfolio were approximately $696.7 million and $599.5 million for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, respectively, compared with average portfolio balances of $520.7 million and $446.9 million, respectively, in the same periods last year. The average interest rate earned for the corporate investment portfolio was 2.4% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and 2.1% for fiscal 2005, compared with 1.9% and 2.3% in the same periods last year. There were no net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the fourth quarter and net realized losses of $0.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, compared with net realized gains of $2.2 million and $7.4 million in the same periods last year.
INCOME TAXES
The Company's effective income tax rates were 31.0% and 32.5% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, respectively, compared with 32.7% and 32.6% for the same periods last year. The lower effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 is the result of higher levels of tax-exempt income on funds held for clients and on corporate investments. The Company's effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 is expected to approximate 31.5%.

Overview
      We are a leading, national provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. We have a broad portfolio of products and services that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs, which include:
 
      Our strategy is focused on growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, and leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure. We earn revenues primarily through recurring fees for services performed related to our products. Service revenues are largely driven by the number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per pay period. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the respective tax or regulatory agencies or client employees.
      Fiscal 2005 was our fifteenth consecutive year of record total revenues, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our financial results for fiscal 2005 included the following highlights:
      Our growth rates in fiscal 2005 were due to strong service revenue growth of 12% and the impact of expense charges recorded in fiscal 2004 related to pending legal matters. These expense charges reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 by approximately $0.06 per share.
      During fiscal 2005, we began to see positive signs of economic improvement, especially in the interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds Rate by 200 basis points since June 2004 to 3.0% as of May 31, 2005. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 3% year-over-year for fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2.2% compared with 1.8% in fiscal 2004 and 2.5% in fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we were able to offset some of the impact of lower interest rates by realizing gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities of $19.1 million for fiscal 2004 and $17.8 million for fiscal 2003. This compares to net realized gains of $0.2 million in fiscal 2005. The impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the "Market Risk Factors" section.
      We continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:
      Our client base increased to approximately 522,000 clients at May 31, 2005. This compares with approximately 505,000 clients at May 31, 2004, and approximately 490,000 clients at May 31, 2003. Year-over-year client growth was approximately 3.5% for fiscal 2005, compared with 3.1% for fiscal 2004. Client growth excluding the impact of acquisitions was approximately 6% for fiscal 2005 and 7% for fiscal 2004.
Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services:
 
      We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. The approximate composition of our direct sales force is summarized in the following table:
      We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased utilization of our payroll-related and human resource ancillary services. Ancillary services effectively leverage the payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. Penetration of our tax filing and payment services and our employee payment services has continued to increase, and total 90% and 65%, respectively, at May 31, 2005. Our client bases in the human resource and employee benefits areas have continued to grow, as shown in the following table:
      During fiscal 2003, we acquired two payroll service providers servicing small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States. Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") was purchased on September 20, 2002 and InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay") was purchased on April 1, 2003. Since the completion of the acquisitions, we have integrated the sales force, branch operations, and corporate support of these acquired businesses to provide efficiencies in operations and services provided to our clients. By November 2004, we had successfully converted all InterPay clients to our Paychex software platforms and fully completed the integration of InterPay. The Advantage payroll system is being retained for the foreseeable future in order to service clients affiliated with independently owned associate offices and Advantage co-branded products.
Acquired businesses:
      In April 2004, we acquired substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Stromberg LLC ("Stromberg"). This acquisition, along with the October 2003 acquisition of Stromberg's Time In A Box product, has allowed us to expand our product offering to include time and attendance solutions and thus offer value-added products and services to payroll and non-payroll clients.
      We have always focused on customer service and maximizing client retention. Annual fiscal client retention is at record levels of slightly less than 80% of the beginning client base. The most significant factor contributing to our client losses is companies going out of business.
Focus on customer service:
      At May 31, 2005, we maintained a strong financial position with total cash and corporate investments of $707.6 million. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $467.9 million in fiscal 2005 and $389.9 million in fiscal 2004. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. The acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 and Stromberg in fiscal 2004, were funded from our cash and corporate investments. It is anticipated that current cash and corporate investment balances, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and current dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
      For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, and our financial position at May 31, 2005, refer to the charts and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this review.
 
Outlook
      Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 is summarized as follows:
      Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. The expected increase in fiscal 2006 capital expenditures reflects printing equipment, communication system upgrades, and branch expansions. Fiscal 2006 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. In addition, we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2006 to be in the range of $14 million to $15 million.
      Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. We estimate that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2006 would be in the range of $3.7 million to $4.2 million for fiscal 2006. The total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) is expected to average approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2006. Given current accounting interpretations, in order to preserve the accounting treatment on available-for-sale securities of recording market value fluctuations through comprehensive income instead of through the income statement, we do not expect to realize any losses in the investment portfolios in fiscal 2006.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
      Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
      Our total service revenues are comprised of revenues from the Payroll and Human Resource and Benefits product lines. Payroll service revenues are earned primarily from payroll processing, tax filing and payment services, employee payment services, and other ancillary services through either our Core Payroll or Major Market Services. Human Resource and Benefits service revenues are earned primarily from retirement services, workers' compensation insurance administration, section 125 plan administration, Paychex Administrative Services ("PAS") and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") services, and time and attendance solutions.
Revenues:
      Our total service revenues growth year-over-year was 12% for fiscal 2005 and 19% for fiscal 2004. The year-over-year growth in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2005 was due to increased utilization of our ancillary services, growth from within our current client base, and price increases. The increase in Payroll service revenues in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 was attributable to these same factors as well as the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003.
      As of May 31, 2005, 90% of all clients utilized our tax filing and payment services, compared with 89% at May 31, 2004, and 87% at May 31, 2003. We believe our client utilization percentage of the tax filing and payment services is near maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by 65% of our clients at May 31, 2005, compared with 63% at May 31, 2004, and 60% at May 31, 2003. More than 95% of new clients purchase our tax filing and payment services and more than 75% of new clients purchase our employee payment services. Major Market Services revenues totaled $177.7 million, $139.7 million, and $101.7 million for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 27% for fiscal 2005 and 37% for fiscal 2004. Approximately one-third of our new Major Market Services clients are conversions from our Core Payroll service.
 
      The increases in Human Resource and Benefits service revenues in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are primarily related to growth in the number of clients utilizing Retirement Services products, growth in client employees for PAS and PEO services, and the benefit of revenue from the April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg time and attendance solutions.
      Retirement Services revenues totaled $91.4 million, $79.0 million, and $66.7 million in fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. This represents year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and 18% for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. We serviced over 33,000 and 29,000 Retirement Services clients at May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      PAS is a combined package of services that include payroll, employer compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration, and risk management outsourcing designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and benefit costs. Our PEO service provides primarily the same services as PAS, but with Paychex acting as a co-employer of the client's employees. The PEO service is available primarily in the states of Florida and Georgia, where PEOs are more prevalent. Sales of the PAS and PEO products have been strong, with administrative fee revenues from these services increasing 39% and 34% for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our PAS and PEO products serviced over 225,000 and 157,000 client employees as of May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities. The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2004 is the result of higher net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2004. The higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were driven by organic client base growth and fiscal 2004 benefited from our acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003.
      The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31:
Combined Operating and SG&A Expenses:
      Combined operating and selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in fiscal 2005 and 18% in fiscal 2004, excluding the expense charge to increase legal reserve. These increases are primarily the result of our investments in personnel, information technology and other costs to support organic growth, and additional expenses as a result of our April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg. Our acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay in fiscal 2003 contributed to the increases in expenses in fiscal 2004. At May 31, 2005, we had approximately 10,000 employees compared with approximately 9,400 at May 31, 2004, and 8,850 at May 31, 2003.
      Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. In addition to the impact from the 2003 acquisitions of businesses, depreciation expense in fiscal 2004 was higher due in part to the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York, and the placement into service of our $30.0 million consolidated data center, both of which occurred during the first half of fiscal 2003. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from our fiscal 2003 acquisitions. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
      Operating income year-over-year growth was 23% for fiscal 2005 and 8% for fiscal 2004.
Operating Income:
 
The increases in operating income in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are attributable to the factors previously discussed. Operating income growth in fiscal 2005 was impacted by the $35.8 million expense charge for the reserve for pending legal matters in fiscal 2004, net incremental PEO revenue of $6.7 million in fiscal 2005 and $6.4 million in fiscal 2004, and $3.2 million of expense charges related to our captive insurance company in fiscal 2005. Operating income exclusive of interest on funds held for clients and these unusual items increased approximately 15% for fiscal 2005 and approximately 17% in fiscal 2004.
      Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale investment securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenues. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is mainly due to lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 on longer term investments, offset by an increase in average daily invested balances. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is mainly due to a decrease in average daily invested balances, lower average interest rates earned, and lower net realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments. The decrease in average daily invested balances in fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of the sale of corporate investments to fund our Advantage and InterPay acquisitions in fiscal 2003.
Investment Income:
      Our effective income tax rate was 32.5% in fiscal 2005, compared with 32.6% in fiscal 2004, and 32.0% in fiscal 2003. The increase in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios.
Income Taxes:
      Net income year-over-year growth was 22% for fiscal 2005 and 3% for fiscal 2004. The increases in net income for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Net Income:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
      At May 31, 2005, our principal source of liquidity was $707.6 million of cash and corporate investment balances. Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and current dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
      We have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows:
      Our Credit Facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between Paychex and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
      The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against our lines of credit during fiscal 2005 or at May 31, 2005.
 
      We had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $53.1 million and $8.4 million at May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. These letters of credit at May 31, 2005, expire at various dates between December 2005 and July 2006. Included in the $53.1 million is a $44.2 million letter of credit arrangement entered into in fiscal 2005. The letters of credit are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolios, including the $44.2 million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2005 or at May 31, 2005.
      We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2005. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2005:
      Through our acquisition of Advantage, Advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and tax filing services. In addition, Advantage has a relationship with New England Business Service, Inc. ("NEBS") whereby Advantage performs all client functions other than sales and marketing. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates and NEBS commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments is uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates and NEBS in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 was $16.7 million and $14.4 million, respectively.
      In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of our services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services to Paychex and our subsidiaries. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
      We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability and acts of terrorism, and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
      As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
      The increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, impacted by cash from working capital. The increases in non-cash adjustments to net income are primarily related to higher depreciation and amortization on fixed and intangible assets. In fiscal 2004, non-cash adjustments to net income were also impacted by $35.8 million in expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters. The fluctuations in our working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
      Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
      The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to tax authorities for tax filing and payment services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. During fiscal 2003, corporate investments were sold to fund the acquisitions of Advantage and InterPay. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
      In fiscal 2005, we paid $0.4 million related to the acquisition of Stromberg. In fiscal 2004, we paid approximately $12.6 million in cash for the acquisition of Stromberg and $0.6 million of additional purchase price related to the InterPay acquisition. In fiscal 2003, we paid $314.4 million in cash for the acquisition of Advantage and $181.7 million in cash for the acquisition of InterPay.
Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired:
 
      To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2005, we made purchases of property and equipment of $70.7 million, compared with $50.6 million of purchases in fiscal 2004, and $60.2 million in fiscal 2003. In May 2005, we purchased a 127,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York for $10.5 million. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 include the purchase of a 220,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York. In the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we placed into service a consolidated data center to enhance data processing and disaster recovery capabilities. Purchases for the data center of data processing equipment, software, and building improvements in fiscal 2003 was approximately $12.2 million. Construction in progress totaled $29.5 million and $10.9 million at May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. A significant portion of these costs represent software being developed for internal use.
Purchases of property and equipment:
      During fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, and fiscal 2003, we purchased approximately $2.5 million, $1.2 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of our Board of Directors.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
      In October 2004, our Board of Directors approved an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.13 per share from $0.12 per share. In October 2003, our Board of Directors approved a 9.1% increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.12 per share from $0.11 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 52%, 59%, and 56% in fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, and fiscal 2003, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Dividends paid:
      The decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in the number of shares exercised. The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to an increase in both the average exercise price per share and the number of shares exercised. Shares exercised in fiscal 2005 were 0.7 million compared with 1.3 million shares in fiscal 2004 and 0.8 million shares in fiscal 2003. We have recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $4.5 million, $10.2 million, and $5.5 million for fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004, and fiscal 2003, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid-in capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes.
Proceeds from exercise of stock options:
Other
      On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." This statement will require that all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in the financial statements based on their fair values. The pro forma disclosure of the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123 will be contained in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our filed Form 10-K under the heading "Stock-Based Compensation Costs." However, the calculation of compensation costs for share-based payment transactions in accordance with SFAS No. 123R may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under SFAS No. 123. We are currently evaluating the new standard and the models that may be used to calculate the expense for future share-based payment transactions. The effective date of SFAS No. 123R was delayed until fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We anticipate adopting this standard for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006.
New accounting pronouncements:
 
      In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29," which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The statement defines a non-monetary exchange with commercial substance as one in which the future cash flows of an entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We will adopt this statement as required, and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
      In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FIN 46(R)-5 "Implicit Variable Interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FSP FIN 46(R)-5 provides guidance for a reporting enterprise that holds an implicit variable interest in a variable interest entity ("VIE") and is also a related party to other variable interest holders. This guidance requires that if the aggregate variable interests held by the reporting enterprise and its related parties would, if held by a single party, identify that party as the primary beneficiary, then the party within the related party group that is most closely associated with the VIE is the primary beneficiary. The effective date of FSP FIN 46(R)-5 is the first reporting period beginning after March 3, 2005 with early application permitted for periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We do not believe that implementation of this FSP will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
      In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," which establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle. The statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable. The statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of error by restating previously issued financial statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt this statement as required, and we do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
Critical Accounting Policies
      Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
      Service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenues are largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenues, and the costs for delivery are included in operating costs on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
      PEO revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $2,230.8 million, $1,846.1 million, and $1,460.7 million for fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
      Revenues from certain time and attendance solutions are recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and
 
collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
      Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax filing and payment services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities.
      Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we utilize an independent actuary. We do not discount our reserves for workers' compensation insurance.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
      Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
      We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
      In fiscal 2004, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided under a pre-funded, deductible workers' compensation policy with a national insurance company. In fiscal 2005, the policy was no longer pre-funded and claims were paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $500,000 under each of the fiscal 2004 and 2005 policies.
      We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers' compensation claims as of May 31:
      Our investments in debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
      We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high-credit-quality securities. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-
 
temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
      For business combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software, and intangible assets, we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets:
      We have $406.0 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2005, resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment charge was recognized in fiscal 2005 or fiscal 2004. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
      We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
      We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, tax filing and payment services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
      We are subject to various claims and legal matters. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004, we recorded $9.2 million and $26.6 million, respectively, in expense charges to increase the reserve for pending legal matters. At May 31, 2005, approximately $25.3 million of our reserve for pending legal matters remains. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the legal reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded .
Contingent liabilities:
      We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences
Income taxes:
 
are expected to reverse. We account for the tax benefit from the exercise of non-qualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paid-in capital.
Market Risk Factors
      Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale debt securities, and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale debt securities. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer-term available-for-sale investments. We generally direct investments towards high-credit-quality, fixed-rate municipal and government securities and manage the available-for-sale portfolio to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
      Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. The Federal Funds rate has increased to 3.0% as of May 31, 2005. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 2.2% compared with 1.8% for the same period last year. Short-term interest rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2005, but longer term rates, on average, were basically unchanged from the end of fiscal 2004. While short-term and long-term interest rates generally move in the same direction, there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship. When interest rates begin to rise, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as discussed below. The Federal Funds rate decreased from 6.50% at the end of fiscal 2000 to 1.00% at May 31, 2004. The decreasing interest rate environment experienced through fiscal 2004 negatively affected net income growth. During most of fiscal 2004 and 2003, the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longer-term available-for-sale portfolio. During fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, we mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from the sale of our investments.
      Increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short-term investments, which totaled approximately $1.4 billion at May 31, 2005, and over time will increase earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale investments, which totaled approximately $1.8 billion at May 31, 2005. Earnings from the available-for-sale-investments, which currently have an average duration of 1.7 years, will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates. An increasing rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio.
      The cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities at May 31, 2005, by contractual maturity are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
 
      The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
      Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short-term and available-for-sale investments, the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
      The total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) is expected to average approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2006. Our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60% invested in short-term securities with an average duration of thirty days and 40% invested in available-for-sale municipal securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years. We estimate that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2006 would be in the range of $3.7 million to $4.2 million for fiscal 2006.
      The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized loss of $9.9 million at May 31, 2005, compared with a net unrealized loss of $4.2 million at May 31, 2004, and a net unrealized gain of $45.0 million at May 31, 2003. During fiscal 2005, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of $14.4 million to a net unrealized gain of $10.6 million. During fiscal 2004, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately $7.6 million net unrealized loss to $49.6 million net unrealized gain. The net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately $7.0 million at June 23, 2005.
      As of May 31, 2005, and May 31, 2004, we had $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value, with weighted average yields to maturity of 2.7% and 2.3%, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in fair value for our portfolio of securities at May 31, 2005, would be in the range of $7.5 million to $8.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in fair value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations.
      We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA- and AA-rated securities and A-1-rated short-term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single instrument. At May 31, 2005, all available-for-sale and short-term securities classified as cash equivalents held an A-1 or equivalent rating, with over 98% of available-for-sale securities holding an AA rating or better.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Paychex, Inc.'s press release dated September 27, 2005, which reports its financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2005, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
EXHIBIT INDEX
The following exhibit is furnished with this Form 8-K:
          Exhibit 99.1: Press Release of Paychex, Inc. dated September 27, 2005.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
September 27, 2005
First Quarter Fiscal 2006 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 27, 2005  Paychex, Inc. (the "Company" or "Paychex") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $115.0 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2005 ("the first quarter"), a 31% increase over net income of $87.7 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $403.7 million, a 17% increase over $345.0 million for the same period last year.
     "Fiscal 2006 is off to an exceptional start as a stronger than anticipated economy caused revenues and net income to exceed our expectations," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "The strong economy was reflected in higher check volume growth and positive trends in new hire reporting. Along with client base growth and increased ancillary penetration, the above factors contributed to a 10% increase in Payroll service revenue to $308.6 million. Additionally, Major Market Services revenue increased 28% for the first quarter to $52.4 million."
     Human Resource Services revenue increased to $75.8 million for the first quarter. This increase reflects growth in our clients for Retirement Services and growth in client employees served by our Paychex Premier Human Resources (previously referred to as Paychex Administrative Services or "PAS") and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") services. Retirement Services revenue increased 17% for the first quarter to $24.6 million. Administrative fee revenue from Paychex Premier and PEO products increased 35% in the first quarter to $21.5 million.
(SM)
(SM)
     We continue to leverage our business as demonstrated by a drop in total expenses as a percentage of total service revenues to 63%, down from 65% in the same period last year. Our investments to support revenue growth contributed to a moderate increase in total operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. For the first quarter, our operating income was $162.8 million, an increase of 27% over the same period last year.
     Increases in interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income were attributable to average interest rate and average investment balance comparisons as follows:
 
     Commenting on the current year business condition, Judge emphasized, "The first quarter was strong as we have seen the highest check volume growth we have experienced in recent years. While we are hopeful that this will continue, we cannot predict the future impact of recent hurricanes and rising gas prices. We have increased our guidance for fiscal 2006 as we now expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 13% to 15%. Assuming no further announcements to change interest rates, we expect net income growth in the range of 22% to 24%."
     Reflecting on the destruction inflicted by Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast, Judge remarked, "We are very fortunate and grateful that all of our employees have been accounted for and are safe. Additionally, our facilities in New Orleans and all of the client records in that branch office remain intact. Paychex has a business continuity plan in place to respond to unexpected events, and we successfully executed our plan, ensuring that we continued to process payroll for our clients. Through an outstanding effort by our employees in the Baton Rouge, Dallas, Houston and numerous other branch offices, we experienced minimal disruption in servicing our clients in the affected area."

Shares to be issued under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued Shares, or Shares that have been reacquired by the Company and designated as treasury shares. If an Award terminates or is forfeited or cancelled without the issuance of any Shares, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award, to the extent of any such termination, forfeiture, cancellation or other event, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. If the Shares underlying an Award of Restricted Stock are forfeited or otherwise reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, whether or not dividends have been paid on such Shares, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award of Restricted Stock, to the extent of any such forfeiture or reacquisition by the Company, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. In the case of a Stock Appreciation Right, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the number of Shares underlying the Stock Appreciation Right, and not just the Shares actually issued upon the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right.
Shares Available.
          (b) For purposes of this Section 5, if an Award entitles the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award or to which such Award relates shall be counted on the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares available for granting Awards under the Plan.
Accounting for Awards.
          (c) In the event that the Committee shall determine that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) that thereafter may be made the subject of Awards; (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards; and (iii) the purchase or exercise price with respect to any Award.
Adjustments.
          (d)
Award Limitations.
          i. . No Eligible Person may be granted Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or any other Award or Awards the value of which is based solely on an increase in the value of the Shares after the date of grant of such Award or Awards, for more than 1,500,000 Shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5(c)) in the aggregate in any calendar year. The foregoing annual limitation specifically includes the grant of any Award or Awards representing "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m).
Section 
162(m)
Limitation for Certain Types of Awards
          ii. . The maximum amount payable pursuant to all Performance Awards to any Participant in the aggregate in any calendar year shall be $6,000,000 in value, whether payable in cash, Shares or other property. This limitation does not apply to any Award subject to the limitation contained in Section 5(d)i.
Section 
162(m)
Limitation for Performance Awards
          iii. . No more than 7,500,000 Shares, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5(c), shall
Plan Limitation on Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Awards
 
be available under the Plan for issuance pursuant to grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Awards; provided, however, that if any Awards of Restricted Stock Units terminate or are forfeited or cancelled without the issuance of any Shares or if the Shares underlying an Award of Restricted Stock are forfeited or otherwise reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, whether or not dividends have been paid on such Shares, then the Shares subject to such termination, forfeiture, cancellation or reacquisition by the Company shall again be available for grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Awards for purposes of this limitation on grants of such Awards. Grants of Stock Awards other than Awards of Restricted Stock shall only be made to officers and directors of the Company and its Affiliates, shall only be made in lieu of salary or cash bonus, and the number of Shares awarded shall be reasonable.
          iv. The maximum number of Shares that may be delivered under Incentive Stock Option grants shall be 27,500,000, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5(c). In addition, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any individual during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other incentive stock plans of the Company) shall not exceed $100,000. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any individual during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other incentive stock plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Incentive Stock Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options; this provision shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted.
Limitation on Incentive Stock Options.
6. Eligibility.
          Any Eligible Person shall be eligible to be designated a Participant. In determining which Eligible Persons shall receive an Award and the terms of any Award, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective Eligible Persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Company or such other factors as the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem relevant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to full-time or part-time employees (which term as used herein includes, without limitation, officers and Directors who are also employees), and an Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to an employee of an Affiliate unless such Affiliate is also a "subsidiary corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code.
7. Awards.
          (a) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Options to Eligible Persons with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Options
          i. . The purchase price per Share purchasable under an Option shall be determined by the Committee and shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option; provided, however, that the Committee may designate a per share exercise price below Fair Market Value on the date of grant if the Option is granted in substitution for a stock option previously granted by an entity that is acquired by or merged with the Company or an Affiliate so long as the substituted Option preserves the aggregate intrinsic value and the ratio of the exercise price to the Fair Market Value of the stock option that it replaces.
Exercise Price
          ii. The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee but shall not be longer than ten years from the date of grant.
Option Term.
          iii. The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part and the method or methods by which, and the form or forms in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made.
Time and Method of Exercise.
 
          iv. Each Option intended to qualify as Incentive Stock Option shall comply with the requirements applicable to "incentive stock options" under Section 422 of the Code.
Incentive Stock Option Requirements.
          (b) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Persons subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive upon exercise thereof the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine, at any time during a specified period before or after the date of exercise) over (ii) the strike price of the Stock Appreciation Right as specified by the Committee, which price shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right; provided, however, that the Committee may designate a per share strike price below Fair Market Value on the date of grant if the Stock Appreciation Right is granted in substitution for a stock appreciation right previously granted by an entity that is acquired by or merged with the Company or an Affiliate so long as the substituted Stock Appreciation Right preserves the aggregate intrinsic value and the ratio of the strike price to the Fair Market Value of the stock appreciation right that it replaces. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the strike price, term, methods of exercise, dates of exercise, methods of settlement and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate.
Stock Appreciation Rights
          (c) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons Shares without restrictions thereon, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Stock Awards may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
Stock Awards
          (d) The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Persons with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.
          i. . Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right to vote the Shares underlying an Award of Restricted Stock or the right to receive any dividend or other right or property with respect to such Shares), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate. The minimum vesting period of such Awards shall be three years from the date of grant, unless the Award is conditioned on performance of the Company or an Affiliate or on personal performance (other than continued service with the Company or an Affiliate), in which case the Award may vest over a period of at least one year from the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit acceleration of vesting of such Awards in the event of the Participant's death, disability or retirement or a change in control of the Company.
Restrictions
          ii. The Shares underlying any Award of Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted and may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates, which certificate or certificates shall be held by the Company. Such certificate or certificates shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. A stock certificate or certificates, without restrictive legend, representing the Shares underlying an Award of Restricted Stock that is no longer subject to restrictions shall be delivered to the Participant promptly after the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived. In the case of Restricted Stock Units, no Shares shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted. Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period relating to Restricted Stock Units evidencing the right to receive Shares, a stock certificate or certificates, without restrictive
Issuance and Delivery of Shares.
 
legend, representing the underlying Shares shall be issued and delivered to the holder of the Restricted Stock Units.
          iii. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a Participant's termination of employment or resignation or removal as a Director (in either case, as determined under criteria established by the Committee), all Restricted Stock and all Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant at such time and still subject to restrictions shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may, when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company, waive in whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
Forfeiture.
          (e) The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons Performance Awards which are intended to be "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m). A Performance Award granted under the Plan may be payable in cash or in Shares (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock), as determined by the Committee. Performance Awards shall, to the extent required by Section 162(m), be conditioned solely on the achievement of one or more objective Performance Goals, and such Performance Goals shall be established by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m). Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Performance Goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period, the amount of any Performance Award granted, the amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award and any other terms and conditions of any Performance Award shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee shall also certify in writing that such Performance Goals have been met prior to payment of the Performance Awards to the extent required by Section 162(m).
Performance Awards.
          (f)
General.
          i. . Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or for any cash or other consideration as may be determined by the Committee or required by applicable law.
Consideration for Awards
          ii. . Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with or in substitution for any other Award or any award granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or in addition to or in tandem with awards granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.
Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together
          iii. . Subject to the terms of the Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments to be made to the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise or payment of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, in cash, by authorizing a third party to sell Shares (or a sufficient portion thereof) acquired upon exercise of an Award and to remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the proceeds to pay for all the Shares acquired through such exercise and any tax withholding obligations resulting from such exercise, or by a combination thereof.
Forms of Payment under Awards
          iv. . The term of each Option and Stock Appreciation Right, and the period during which the restrictions applicable to each Award of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, shall be for a period not longer than ten years from the date of grant.
Term of Awards
          v. . The Committee shall have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations to determine the treatment of a Participant's Awards under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death, disability, termination or breach of Section 9(f), and in the event of a change of control of the Company. In addition, notwithstanding the rules and regulations promulgated by the Committee and in effect from time to time and the terms of any Award Agreement, the Committee shall have the right to
Committee Rules
 
extend the period for exercise of any Option or Stock Appreciation Right, provided such extension does not exceed the term of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right.
          vi. . The Committee may, in its discretion, (i) permit selected Participants to elect to defer payments of some or all types of Awards in accordance with procedures established by the Committee or (ii) provide for the deferral of an Award in an Award Agreement or otherwise.
Deferral
          vii. . Dividends or dividend equivalent rights may be extended to and made part of any Award denominated in Shares or units of Shares, subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as the Committee may establish. The Committee may also establish rules and procedures for the crediting of interest on deferred cash payments and dividend equivalents for deferred payments denominated in Shares or units of Shares.
Dividends and Interest
          viii. . Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, the terms of this Plan or the terms of an Award Agreement, (A) no Award and no right under any such Award shall be transferable by a Participant other than by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a domestic relations order, and (B) no Award or right under any such Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 7(f)ix, the Shares underlying any Award may be transferred at any time after such Shares are issued and no longer restricted.
Limits on Transfer of Awards
          ix. . All Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan, applicable federal or state securities laws and regulatory requirements, and the Committee may cause appropriate entries to be made or legends to be placed on the certificates for such Shares or other securities to reflect such restrictions. If the Shares or other securities are traded on a securities exchange, the Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares or other securities covered by an Award unless and until such Shares or other securities have been admitted for trading on such securities exchange.
Limits on Transfer of Shares
          x. . In order to comply with all applicable federal, state, local or foreign income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal, state, local or foreign payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant, are withheld or collected from such Participant. In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of the applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to satisfy such tax obligation by (A) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes or (B) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes. The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
Income Tax Withholding
          xi. . Unless the applicable Award Agreement provides otherwise, every Option and Stock Appreciation Right may be redeemed by the Company in connection with the merger, consolidation, separation (including a spin off or other distribution of stock or property), reorganization (whether or not such reorganization comes within the meaning of such term in Section 368(a) of the Code) or partial or complete liquidation of the Company. The redemption price for any Option redeemed by the Company shall be the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying such Option, less the exercise price of such Option, and the redemption price for any Stock
Company Redemption Right
 
Appreciation Right redeemed by the Company shall be the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying such Stock Appreciation Right, less the strike price of such Stock Appreciation Right. The redemption price, less any amount of federal or state taxes attributable to the redemption that the Company deems it necessary or advisable to pay or withhold, shall be paid in cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Option or Stock Appreciation Right constitutes "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A, and if the Company's redemption right under this Section 7(f)xi would cause such Option or Stock Appreciation Right to be subject to excise tax under Section 409A, then the Company's redemption right under this Section 7(f)xi with respect to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be limited to those triggering events that constitute a "change in ownership," a "change in effective control" or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets" of the Company for purposes of Section 409A.
8. Amendment and Termination; Corrections.
          (a) . The Board of Directors of the Company may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan, provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement, prior approval of the stockholders of the Company shall be required for any amendment to the Plan that: (i) requires stockholder approval under the rules or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASDAQ or other securities exchange that are applicable to the Company; (ii) increases the number of Shares authorized under the Plan, as specified in Section 5(a); (iii) increases the limitations contained in Section 5(d); (iv) permits repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, which is prohibited by Section 4(a); (v) permits the award of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights at a price less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, contrary to the provisions of Sections 7(a)i and 7(b); or (vi) would cause Section 162(m) to become unavailable with respect Awards granted under the Plan.
Amendments to the Plan
          (b) Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may waive any conditions of or rights of the Company under any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such action may adversely affect the rights of the holder of such Award without the consent of the Participant or holder or beneficiary thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Award constitutes "nonqualified deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A, and if the Company's rights under this Section 8(b) would cause such Award to be subject to excise tax under Section 409A, then the Company's rights under this Section 8(b) with respect to such Awards shall be limited to the taking of only those actions that do not cause such Award to be subject to excise tax under Section 409A.
Amendments to Awards.
          (c) The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to implement or maintain the effectiveness of the Plan.
Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies.
9. General Provisions.
          (a) . No Eligible Person, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
No Rights to Awards
          (b) No Participant shall have rights under an Award granted to such Participant unless and until an Award Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Company and, if requested by the Company, signed by the Participant.
Award Agreements.
          (c) Except with respect to Restricted Stock and Stock Awards, neither a Participant nor the Participant's legal representative shall be, or have any of the
No Rights of Stockholders.
 
rights and privileges of, a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon the exercise or payment of any Award, in whole or in part, unless and until the Shares have been issued.
          (d) . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation plans or arrangements, and such plans or arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
No Limit on Other Compensation Plans or Arrangements
          (e) The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, or a Director to be retained as a Director, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment or service as a Director at any time, with or without cause. In addition, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment or service as a Director, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or any Award, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.
No Right to Employment or Directorship.
          (f) A Participant will not, without the written consent of the Company, either during his or her employment by the Company or thereafter, disclose to anyone or make use of any confidential information which he or she has acquired during his or her employment relating to any of the business of the Company, except as such disclosure or use may be required in connection with his or her work as an employee of Company. During a Participant's employment by Company, and for a period of two years after the termination of such employment, he or she will not, either as principal, agent, consultant, employee, stockholder or otherwise, engage in any work or other activity in direct competition with the Company in the field or fields in which he or she has worked for the Company. The non-competition agreement in this Section 9(f) applies only to the extent that its application shall be permitted by applicable law and reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company. For purposes of this Section 9(f), a Participant shall not be deemed a stockholder if the Participant's record and beneficial ownership amount to not more than one percent of the outstanding capital stock of any company subject to the periodic and other reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
Non-Competition; Confidentiality.
          (g) No person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, the Company and its Affiliates and their directors, officers, agents and employees, makes any representation, commitment, or guarantee that any tax treatment, including, but not limited to, federal, state and local income, estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to the tax treatment of any Award, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant on account of participation in the Plan.
No Guarantee of Tax Consequences.
          (h) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Board or the Committee and other persons connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, the employees and directors of the Company and its Affiliates performing services on behalf of the Committee, against any liability, cost or expense arising as a result of any claim asserted by any person or entity under the laws of any state or of the United States with respect to any action or failure to act of such individuals taken in connection with this Plan, except claims or liabilities arising on account of the willful misconduct or bad faith of such Board member, Committee member or individual.
Indemnification.
          (i) The validity and construction of the Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, as well as any Agreement made under it, to the extent that federal laws do not control, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws.
Governing Law.
          (j) If any provision of the Plan or any Award is, becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, then such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability.
 
          (k) Insofar as it provides for Awards of cash, Shares or rights thereto, this Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Participants who are entitled to cash, Shares or rights thereto under this Plan, any such accounts shall be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by cash, Shares or rights thereto, nor shall this Plan be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Company, the Board or the Committee be deemed to be a trustee of any cash, Shares or rights thereto to be granted under this Plan. Any liability or obligation of the Company to any Participant with respect to a grant of cash, Shares or rights thereto under this Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created by this Plan and any Award Agreement, and no such liability or obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. None of the Company, the Board or the Committee shall be required to give any security or bond for the performance of any obligation that may be created by this Plan.
Unfunded Plan.
          (l) The Company intends that any Awards under the Plan satisfy the requirements of Section 409A to avoid the imposition of excise taxes thereunder. If any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 409A, that provision will be reformed to avoid imposition of the excise tax and no action taken to comply with Section 409A shall be deemed to impair a benefit under the Plan or an Award Agreement.

EXHIBIT 10.2
     1. . This Award Agreement serves to notify you that the Compensation and Governance Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") hereby grants to you, under the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective October 12, 2005 (the "Plan"), an Incentive Stock Option (the "Option") to purchase, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Award Agreement and the Plan, up to the number of shares of the Company's $.01 par value common stock (the "Common Stock") at the price per share set forth above. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Award Agreement. You may obtain a copy of the Plan from the Office of the Corporate Secretary. You should review the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan carefully. The capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement are defined in the Plan.
Grant of Option
     2. . Unless the Option is previously terminated pursuant to the terms of this Award Agreement or the Plan, the Option will expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date set forth above.
Term
     3. . Subject to the terms set forth in this Award Agreement and the Plan, the Option will vest and become exercisable pro rata with respect to one-fifth of the shares subject to such Option on the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Date of Grant, with any fractional share resulting from such proration vesting on the fifth anniversary. Vesting is contingent on your continued employment through the vesting dates.
Vesting
     4. .
Exercise
          (a) . To the extent exercisable under Section 3 of this Award Agreement, the Option may be exercised in whole or in part, provided that the Option
Method of Exercise
 
may not be exercised for less than one share of Common Stock in any single transaction. The Option may be exercised using a method specified by the Company.
     (b) . The exercise of the Option is conditioned upon your payment to the Company of the Exercise Price for the number of shares of Common Stock that you elect to purchase. The Exercise Price may be paid in cash or by check or by way of a broker-assisted stock option exercise program, if such a program is made available by the Company at the time of the exercise of the Option.
Payment of Exercise Price
     (c) . The exercise of the Option is conditioned upon your making arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the payment to the Company of the amount of all taxes required by any governmental authority to be withheld and paid over by the Company or any Affiliate to the governmental authority on account of the exercise. The payment of such withholding taxes to the Company may be made (i) by you in cash or by check, or (ii) by the Company or any Affiliate withholding such taxes from any other compensation owed to you by the Company or any Affiliate. Withholding of shares of Common Stock for payment of tax withholdings is not permitted for any reason.
Withholding
     (d) . The exercise of the Option is contingent on your having executed and delivered to the Company a Confidential Information and Non-Solicitation Agreement.
Confidential Information and Non-Solicitation Agreement
     (e) . Upon determining that compliance with this Award Agreement has occurred, including compliance with such reasonable requirements as the Company may impose pursuant to the Plan or Section 12 of this Award Agreement, the Company shall issue to you a certificate for the shares of Common Stock purchased on the earliest practicable date (as determined by the Company) thereafter.
Issuance of Shares
     5. . In the event of your death or Disability prior to the complete exercise of the Option, any unvested portion of the Option will vest in full immediately and the remaining portion of the Option may be exercised in whole or in part, subject to all of the conditions on exercise imposed by the Plan and this Award Agreement, within one year after the date of your death or Disability, but only (i) by you, or in the event of your death, by your estate or the person or persons to whom the Option passes under your will or the laws of descent and distribution, and (ii) prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date of the Option. The term "Disability" means a condition whereby you are unable to perform the essential functions of your position with reasonable accommodations by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted for a continuous period of not less than six months, all as verified by a physician acceptable to, or selected by, the Company.
Effect of Death and Disability
     6. . Upon your termination for a reason other than death or Disability prior to the complete exercise of the Option, the unvested portion of the Option will be canceled as of your last day worked, and the remaining portion of the Option may be exercised in whole or in part, subject to all of the conditions on exercise imposed by the Plan and this Award Agreement, within three months after the date of such termination, but only (i) to the extent that the Option was vested and exercisable on the date of such termination, and (ii) prior
Effect of Other Termination
 
to the close of business on the Expiration Date of the Option.

PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
December 21, 2005
Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 21, 2005  Paychex, Inc. (the "Company" or "Paychex") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $112.6 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended November 30, 2005 ("the second quarter"), a 30% increase over net income of $86.9 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $399.8 million, a 15% increase over $347.3 million for the same period last year.
     "We are very pleased with the positive results achieved in our second quarter. They were in line with our expectations and position us very well to achieve our full year guidance. Client base growth and increased ancillary penetration were the key drivers for our 9% increase in second quarter Payroll service revenue. This, coupled with Major Market Services second quarter revenue growth of 26%, leaves us very optimistic about the year," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 32% to $75.1 million for the second quarter. This increase reflects growth in our clients for Retirement Services and growth in client employees served by our Paychex Premier Human Resources (previously referred to as Paychex Administrative Services or "PAS") and Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") services. Retirement Services revenue increased 15% for the second quarter to $25.8 million. Administrative fee revenue from Paychex Premier increased 66% for the second quarter to $12.8 million. Revenue from our PEO products increased 37% in the second quarter to $14.3 million.
(SM)
(SM)
     We continue to leverage our business as demonstrated by a drop in total expenses in the second quarter as a percentage of total service revenues to 64%, down from 66% in the same period last year. Our investments to support revenue growth contributed to a moderate increase in total operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. For the second quarter, our operating income was $158.6 million, an increase of 25% over the same period last year.
     Increases in interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income were attributable to average interest rate and average investment balance comparisons as follows:
 
Year-to-Date Fiscal 2006 Highlights:
     The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2005 are as follows:
Outlook:
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 is the same as provided in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended August 31, 2005, except for the inclusion of the effect of the Federal Funds rate increases on November 1, 2005 and December 13, 2005.

PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
March 28, 2006
Third Quarter Fiscal 2006 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 28, 2006  Paychex, Inc. (the "Company" or "Paychex") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $114.5 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended February 28, 2006 ("the third quarter"), a 23% increase over net income of $92.8 million, or $0.24 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $430.6 million, a 15% increase over $373.9 million for the same period last year.
     "We are very pleased with our results for the third quarter, which once again, produced record revenues and earnings. They were in line with our expectations and position us very well to achieve our full year guidance. The third quarter includes our most important selling season when we add approximately one-third of our new payroll clients for the year. We just completed an outstanding selling season and client year end which will position us for a good start in fiscal 2007," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 24% to $81.9 million for the third quarter. The increase for the third quarter reflects growth in the following services: Retirement Services increased 15% to $27.6 million, administrative fee revenue from Paychex PremierHuman Resources increased 54% to $13.0 million, Professional Employer Organization services increased 9% to $17.2 million, and revenues from other Human Resource Services increased 35% to $24.1 million.
(SM)
     Growth in total expenses was 13% for the third quarter and 11% for the nine months ended February 28, 2006. The third quarter was impacted by higher commissions and bonus expenses as we exceeded our year-to-date sales targets. We also incurred higher expenses in the third quarter through our commitment to continuously improve client service by reducing the number of clients per payroll specialist. For the third quarter, our operating income was $160.6 million, an increase of 19% over the same period last year.
     Increases in interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income were attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
 
Year-to-Date Fiscal 2006 Highlights:
     The highlights for the nine months ended February 28, 2006 are as follows:
Outlook:
     Our guidance for the full fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 is provided in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 28, 2006 and has been updated including the effect of the Federal Funds rate increase on January 31, 2006. Total revenue growth is estimated to be in the range of 14% to 16% with net income growth expected to be in the range of 24% to 26%.

Table of Contents
ITEM 5.03.      AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BY-LAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR.
Effective April 13, 2006, the Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") Board of Directors amended Article III, Section 1 of the Company's By-laws to adopt a majority vote standard for election of directors. As amended, the Company's By-laws provide for election of directors by a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections where the number of nominees is equal to the number of directors to be elected. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted by stockholders "for" the election of a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the nominee. In contested elections, where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, directors are elected by plurality vote.
If a nominee that is an incumbent director does not receive a required majority of the votes cast, the director must offer his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance and Compensation Committee shall consider such offer and will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will consider the Committee's recommendation and will determine whether to accept such offer. The Board shall publicly disclose its decision, and the rationale behind it, within 90 days from the date of the certification of the stockholder vote results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's or the Committee's decisions.
In the event that no nominees for election to the Board receive a required majority of the votes cast at an annual meeting, a special meeting of stockholders shall be called for an election of directors in the manner provided in the By-laws. Each director shall hold office until such director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal.
The amendment is effective as of April 13, 2006 and the Company's amendment to its By-laws is filed as Exhibit 3(ii) to this Form 8-K.
EXHIBIT INDEX
The following exhibits are filed with this Form 8-K.
          Exhibit 3(ii):      Amendment No. 2 to the By-laws of Paychex, Inc.
          Exhibit 99.1:       Press Release of Paychex, Inc. dated April 17, 2006.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 3(ii)
Article III, Section 1 of the By-laws of Paychex, Inc., is hereby amended and restated as set forth below:
SECTION 1. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members, the exact number to be fixed from time to time by the board of directors. Except as provided in Sections 9 and 10 of this Article, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" the election of a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the nominee. If a nominee that is an incumbent director does not receive a required majority of the votes cast, the director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance and Compensation Committee shall consider such offer and will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will consider the Committee's recommendation and will determine whether to accept such offer. In making their determinations, the Board and the Committee may consider any factors deemed relevant. The Board shall publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Board's or the Committee's decisions with respect to his or her resignation. In the event that no nominees for election to the Board receive a required majority of the votes cast, at an annual meeting, a special meeting of stockholders shall be called for an election of directors in the manner provided in these Bylaws. Each director shall hold office until such director's successor is elected and qualified or until such director's earlier resignation or removal.

 
Paychex, Inc. Board of Directors Adopts Majority Vote Standard for Election of Board of Directors
ROCHESTER, NY, April 17, 2006  The Board of Directors of Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ: PAYX) today announced the Company has amended its By-laws to adopt a majority vote standard for uncontested director elections, beginning with the next election of directors in October 2006.
"Our decision on majority voting demonstrates Paychex's commitment to effective corporate governance policies for our shareholders. Majority voting gives our shareholders a greater voice in the election of directors and represents a more accountable alternative to the current plurality system commonly used in the United States," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
Under the majority vote standard, which replaces plurality voting for uncontested director elections, the number of votes by stockholders "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In a contested election where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, directors will continue to be elected by plurality vote.
Under the laws of the state of Delaware, where the Company is incorporated, if an incumbent director is not elected, that director continues to serve as a "holdover director" until the director's successor is duly elected and qualified. To address this potential outcome, the Board also adopted a corresponding director resignation policy in the Company's By-laws. If an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of the votes cast, the director must offer his or her resignation to the Board. The Governance and Compensation Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board shall disclose its decision, and the rationale behind it, within 90 days from the date of the certification of the stockholder vote results.

"Our sixteenth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings included a 4% increase in our client base that now consists of approximately 543,000 clients, record client retention levels, and revenue and profit results that exceeded our long term objectives. Looking to fiscal 2007, we are well positioned to continue our tradition of excellent growth in all areas by continually improving our client service levels, offering new and enhanced services, and increasing ancillary product penetration within our client base."

We expect to file our fiscal 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission within seventy-five days after our May 31, 2006 fiscal year-end. The fiscal 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K will contain a complete set of audited Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the final Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services product lines offer a portfolio of products and services that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs.
     Our Payroll services are provided through either our Core Payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS") and include:
 
     MMS is utilized by clients that have more complex payroll and benefits needs. While MMS is focused on the more than fifty employees market segment, MMS has many clients with less than fifty employees that have more complex payroll requirements.
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We earn revenues primarily through recurring fees for services performed related to our products. Service revenues are primarily driven by the number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per pay period. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services, growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, and leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure.
     Fiscal 2006 was our sixteenth consecutive year of record total revenues, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our financial results for fiscal 2006 included the following highlights:
     Our financial performance in fiscal 2006 was largely due to strong service revenue growth of 14%. This growth in service revenue was attributable to growth in client base, check volume, and utilization of ancillary services.
     Our financial performance was also positively impacted by the effects of increases in interest rates earned on our funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. The Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds rate by 200 basis points in fiscal 2005 and by another 200 basis points in fiscal 2006 to the present rate of 5.00% at May 31, 2006. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 73% for fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 3.2%, increased from 2.2% in fiscal 2005 and 1.8% in fiscal 2004. The impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the "Market Risk Factors" section.
 
     We continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:
     Our client base increased to approximately 543,000 clients at May 31, 2006. This compares with approximately 522,000 clients at May 31, 2005, and approximately 505,000 clients at May 31, 2004. Client growth was approximately 4.0% for fiscal 2006, compared with approximately 3.5% for fiscal 2005.
Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services:
     We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. The approximate composition of our direct sales force is summarized in the following table:
     We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased utilization of our payroll-related and human resource ancillary services. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. Penetration of our payroll tax administration services has continued to increase, and was 92% at May 31, 2006, compared with 90% at May 31, 2005, and 89% at May 31, 2004. Employee payment services penetration has increased to 68% at May 31, 2006, compared with 65% at May 31, 2005, and 63% at May 31, 2004. Our client bases in the Human Resource Services areas have continued to grow, as shown in the following table:
     : During fiscal 2006, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of products and services and expand into new markets, and:
Product and service initiatives
     We will supplement our growth through strategic acquisition when opportunities arise. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2003, we expanded our client base through the acquisitions of Advantage Payroll Services, Inc. ("Advantage") and InterPay, Inc. ("InterPay"). In fiscal 2004, the acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of Stromberg LLC ("Stromberg") along with the acquisition of Stromberg's Time In A Box product, allowed us to expand our product offering to include time and attendance solutions and thus offer
Business acquisitions:
 
value-added products and services to payroll and non-payroll clients. We currently have no definitive agreements or current plans with respect to any material prospective acquisition.
     We have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention. Fiscal 2006 client retention is at record levels of slightly less than 80% of our beginning client base. The most significant factor contributing to our client losses is business closures. In fiscal 2006, we reduced the number of clients per payroll specialist due to our commitment to continuously improve customer service.
Focus on customer service:
     At May 31, 2006, we maintained a strong financial position with total cash and corporate investments of $577.4 million. We also had $384.5 million in long-term corporate investments at May 31, 2006. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $569.2 million in fiscal 2006, a growth of 22% over $466.6 million in fiscal 2005. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is anticipated that current cash and corporate investment balances, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Financial position:
     Certain prior periods presented reflect the change in classification of variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") and auction rate securities from cash equivalents to available-for-sale securities. This reclassification had no impact on reported consolidated earnings.
Reclassifications:
     VRDNs and auction rate securities are variable-rate securities that are tied to short-term interest rates and priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the respective tender or auction features. We invest in these securities to provide near-term liquidity and have historically classified these securities as cash equivalents if the period between interest rate resets was ninety days or less. Based on our review of the contractual maturity dates associated with the underlying securities, which are typically in excess of ninety days and often are twenty to thirty years, and as liquidity is provided by a party other than the original issuer, we have reclassified VRDNs and auction rate securities to available-for-sale securities within corporate investments and funds held for clients, for each of the periods presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This reclassification from cash equivalents to available-for sale securities at May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005 was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, within funds held for clients and $263.5 million and $203.3 million, respectively, between cash and cash equivalents and corporate investments.
     As of May 31, 2006, we have separately reported our long-term corporate investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have the ability to hold these investments for a period in excess of one year. To conform to this current period presentation, we have also reclassified our investments at May 31, 2005.
     Certain prior period amounts within our Consolidated Income Statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifications between operating and selling, general and administrative expenses to more appropriately reflect our way of conducting business.
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, and our financial position at May 31, 2006, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section.
 
Outlook
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 ("fiscal 2007") is based upon current economic conditions and interest rate levels and is summarized as follows:
     Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2007 are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, in line with our growth rates. Fiscal 2007 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately $55 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2007 to be approximately $14 million.
     Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. We estimate that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2007 would be in the range of $4.5 million to $5.0 million for fiscal 2007. The total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) is expected to average approximately $4.5 billion in fiscal 2007. Given current accounting interpretations, in order to preserve the accounting treatment on available-for-sale securities of recording market value fluctuations through comprehensive income instead of through the income statement, we do not expect to realize any losses in the investment portfolios in fiscal 2007.
 
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
     Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
 
     The increases in Payroll service revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, and in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, were primarily attributable to growth in clients, check volume, and utilization of our ancillary services.
Revenues:
     As of May 31, 2006, 92% of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, compared with 90% at May 31, 2005, and 89% at May 31, 2004. We believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by 68% of our clients at May 31, 2006, compared with 65% at May 31, 2005, and 63% at May 31, 2004. More than 95% of new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 75% of new clients purchase our employee payment services.
     MMS revenue increased 27% for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 to $225.0 million and $176.9 million, respectively. Approximately one-third of our new MMS clients are conversions from our Core Payroll service. We had over 33,000 MMS clients at May 31, 2006.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 29% in fiscal 2006 and 26% in fiscal 2005 as a result of higher revenues from the following services:
 
     The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2006 and higher average portfolio balances. The increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2005 and higher average portfolio balances, offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of available-for-sale securities. The higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were driven by client base growth, wage inflation, check volume growth within our current client base, and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services. See the "Market Risk Factors" section for more information on changing rates.
     The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31:
Combined Operating and SG&A Expenses:
     Combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2006 and 10% in fiscal 2005, excluding the expense charge to increase the legal reserve in fiscal 2004. The increases in both fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2005 were the result of our continued investment in information technology to create more efficient processes and systems as well as investment in personnel and other costs to support organic growth. During fiscal 2006, total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense, continued investments in new products and services, geographic expansion within Germany, and other expenditures to continually improve client service. Fiscal 2005 growth was impacted by additional expenses as a result of our April 2004 acquisition of Stromberg. At May 31, 2006, we had approximately 10,900 employees compared with approximately 10,000 at May 31, 2005 and 9,400 at May 31, 2004.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Depreciation expense increased in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to the purchase in May 2005 of a 127,000-square foot building in Rochester, New York and higher levels of capital expenditures. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions, which are amortized using accelerated methods. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
     Operating income year-over-year growth was 22% for fiscal 2006 and 23% for fiscal 2005. The increases in operating income in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating Income:
     Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenues. The increase in investment income in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is mainly due to higher average interest rates earned in fiscal 2006 and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations. The decrease in investment income in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is mainly due to lower net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities and lower average interest rates earned on longer-term investments, offset by an increase in average daily balances.
Investment Income, Net:
     Our effective income tax rate was 31.1% in fiscal 2006, compared with 32.5% in fiscal 2005, and 32.6% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of
Income Taxes:
 
higher levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and a lower effective state income tax rate.
     Net income growth was 26% for fiscal 2006 and 22% for fiscal 2005. The increases in net income for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 are attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Net Income:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     At May 31, 2006, our principal source of liquidity was $577.4 million of cash and corporate investments. We also had $384.5 million in long-term corporate investments at May 31, 2006. Current cash and corporate investments and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     We have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows:
     Our credit facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2006 or at May 31, 2006.
     We had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $53.4 million at May 31, 2006, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. These letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2006 and December 2008 and are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolios, including a $44.2 million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account. Effective June 28, 2006, this $44.2 million letter of credit was increased to $50.9 million, bringing the total letters of credit outstanding to $60.2 million. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2006 or at May 31, 2006.
 
     We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2006. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at May 31, 2006:
 
     Advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. In addition, we have a relationship with New England Business Services, Inc. ("NEBS"), whereby Advantage performs all client functions other than sales and marketing. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates and NEBS commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments is uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates and NEBS in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was $19.0 million and $16.7 million, respectively.
     We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services to Paychex and our subsidiaries. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
     We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism, and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The increase in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was driven by higher net income, impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
     The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to tax authorities for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section.
     In fiscal 2004, we paid approximately $12.6 million in cash for the acquisition of Stromberg and $0.6 million of additional purchase price related to the InterPay acquisition.
Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired:
     To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. In fiscal 2006, we made purchases of property and equipment of $81.1 million, compared with $70.7 million of purchases in fiscal 2005 and $50.6 million of purchases in fiscal 2004. In
Purchases of property and equipment:
 
May 2005, we purchased a 127,000-square-foot facility in Rochester, New York for $10.5 million. Construction in progress totaled $36.3 million and $29.5 million at May 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of these costs, $29.4 million and $18.9 million represent software being developed for internal use at May 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use, at which time we will begin amortization of the costs.
     During fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, we purchased approximately $4.6 million, $2.5 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation, whose Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer is a member of our Board of Directors.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     In October 2005, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.16 per share from $0.13 per share. In October 2004, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.13 per share from $0.12 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 50%, 52%, and 59% in fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, respectively. Future dividends are dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.
Dividends paid:
     The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 is primarily due to an increase in the number of shares exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share. The decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in the number of shares exercised. Shares exercised in fiscal 2006 were 1.7 million compared with 0.7 million shares in fiscal 2005 and 1.3 million shares in fiscal 2004. We have recognized a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $11.6 million, $4.5 million, and $10.2 million for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, respectively. This tax benefit reduces the accrued income tax liability and increases additional paid-in capital, with no impact on the expense amount for income taxes.
Proceeds from exercise of stock options:
Other
     In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." This statement requires that all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in the financial statements based on their fair values measured at the date of grant.
New accounting pronouncements:
     Prior to June 1, 2006, we had accounted for grants of employee stock options under the intrinsic value method allowed under APB 25 and related interpretations, and therefore had not recognized any compensation costs for stock-based awards. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we presented pro forma financial results including the effects of share-based compensation costs in the footnotes to the financial statements.
     SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and permits adoption using one of the following two methods:
 
     We will adopt this standard beginning June 1, 2006, using the modified prospective method. Accordingly, the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations. We anticipate the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will negatively impact net income in the range of 4% to 5% in fiscal 2007, increasing our operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses.
     Unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to Existing Awards as of May 31, 2006 was approximately $38.3 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. We cannot yet estimate what the compensation cost impact will be on our financial statements for the awards that we issue after June 1, 2006, as it will depend on the terms of any future grants approved by the Board of Directors and the underlying assumptions used in calculating the fair value at the time of any such future grants. The calculation of fair value is very sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions, especially volatility and expected option term life.
     In addition, SFAS No. 123(R) will impact how income taxes are recorded to our financial statements, as tax deductions for certain tax-qualified option grants ("incentive stock options") are allowed only at the time a taxable disposition occurs. This may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the early periods after adoption and it could cause variability in our effective tax rate throughout a fiscal year as these events occur.
     SFAS No. 123(R) also amends SFAS No. 95, "Statement of Cash Flows," to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid in operating cash flows. We cannot estimate what the amount of excess tax deductions will be in future periods. However, the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for excess tax deductions were $11.6 million, $4.5 million, and $10.2 million for the years ended May 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
     Our pro-forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123 utilized a Black-Scholes option pricing model for valuing employee stock options and allocated the expense using an accelerated method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will continue to use a Black-Scholes option pricing model, but will begin to allocate the expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period to better reflect the cost of employee services provided.
     Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will be required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. In our pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, we have accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Our assumptions for forfeitures will be determined based on factors including type of award and historical experience, and will be reevaluated regularly as an award vests.
     We currently offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to all employees, under which stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with no discount to the market price and no look-back provision. We have determined that this plan is non-compensatory and is not subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Therefore, no compensation costs will be recognized related to this plan.
     The following FASB Staff Positions ("FSP") issued during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2006 and related to SFAS No. 123(R) are currently being evaluated and will be applied upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2006:
 
     In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period." This FSP provides that rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. The guidance in this FSP was effective in the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. We have historically expensed rental costs incurred during a construction period, and therefore, the adoption of this FSP did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position.
     In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments." This FSP provides guidance on determining if an investment is considered to be impaired, if the impairment is other-than-temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. It also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The guidance in this FSP amends SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" and was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. We account for investments in accordance with this guidance, and therefore, the adoption of this FSP did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
     In February and March 2006, the FASB issued the following statements amending SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities  a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125":
     The guidance in these statements is effective in the first fiscal year beginning after September 15, 2006. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments and currently do not have any servicing assets or servicing liabilities that would fall under the guidance of either statement, and therefore, the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
Critical Accounting Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
     Service revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenues are largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenues, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     PEO revenues are included in service revenues and are reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $2,414.5 million, $2,230.8 million, and $1,846.1 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
 
     Revenues from certain time and attendance solutions are recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt, with some items extending to ninety days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
     Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we utilize an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the financial statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
     We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
     In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $750,000 under the fiscal 2006 policy and $500,000 under the fiscal 2005 policy.
     We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers' compensation claims as of May 31:
     Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at market value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income, net of tax. However, changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
 
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities, AAA- and AA-rated securities and A-1-rated short-term securities. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment.
     For business combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software and intangible assets, we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets:
     We have $405.8 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at May 31, 2006, resulting from acquisitions in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
     We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
     We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
     We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. At May 31, 2006, we had approximately $15.6 million of reserves for pending legal matters. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the legal reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Contingent liabilities:
     We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
Income taxes:
 
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We account for the tax benefit from the exercise of non-qualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paid-in capital.
Market Risk Factors
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities, we generally direct investments towards high credit quality, fixed-rate municipal and government securities and manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. The Federal Funds rate has increased to 5.00% as of May 31, 2006. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2006, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 3.2% compared with 2.2% and 1.8% for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Short-term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, longer-term rates, on average, were basically unchanged from fiscal 2004, but have risen steadily in fiscal 2006. While short-term and long-term interest rates generally move in the same direction, there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship. While interest rates are rising, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as discussed below. The Federal Funds rate decreased from 6.50% at the end of fiscal 2000 to 1.00% at May 31, 2004. The decreasing interest rate environment experienced through fiscal 2004 negatively affected net income growth. During fiscal 2004, the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longer-term available-for-sale securities. During fiscal 2004, we mitigated some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from sales of our investments.
     Increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short-term investments, and over time will increase earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities, which currently have an average duration of 2.0 years excluding the impact of auction rate securities and VRDNs that are tied to short-term interest rates, will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates. An increasing interest rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the market value of our investment portfolio.
     The cost and market value of available-for-sale securities which have stated maturities at May 31, 2006, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
 
     VRDNs and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities is typically twenty to thirty years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, both are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature.
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, daily interest rate changes, seasonal variations in investment balances, actual duration of short-term and available-for-sale securities, the proportional mix of taxable and tax-exempt investments, and changes in tax-exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates, which are not synchronized or simultaneous. Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $3.9 billion for the full year ended May 31, 2006. Our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60% invested in short-term securities and available-for-sale securities that are priced and traded as short-term securities (auction rate securities and VRDNs) with an average duration of 35 days, and 40% invested in other available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years. Based on these current assumptions, we estimate that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2007 would be approximately $4.5 million to $5.0 million for fiscal 2007.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of $22.0 million at May 31, 2006, compared with a net unrealized loss of $9.9 million at May 31, 2005, and a net unrealized loss of $4.2 million at May 31, 2004. During fiscal 2006, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of $25.2 million to $6.1 million. During fiscal 2005, the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately $14.4 million net unrealized loss to $10.6 million net unrealized gain. The net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately $29.0 million at June 23, 2006.
     As of May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, we had $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at market value. Excluding auction rate securities and VRDNs classified as available-for-sale securities which are tied to short-term interest rates, the weighted average yields to maturity were 3.0% and 2.6%, as of May 31, 2006 and May 31, 2005, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities at May 31, 2006, would be approximately $8.5 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations.
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in AAA- and AA-rated securities and A-1- rated short-term securities, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.

EXHIBIT 99.1
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
September 26, 2006
First Quarter Fiscal 2007 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 26, 2006  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $135.1 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2006 (the "first quarter"), a 17% increase over net income of $115.0 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenues were $459.4 million, a 14% increase over $403.7 million for the same period last year.
     "We continued our tradition of record financial results as demonstrated by a strong first quarter which provides a very good start to fiscal 2007. We entered the year knowing our first quarter comparisons would be difficult due to the exceptionally strong first quarter we experienced a year ago. I was pleased to see results better than we expected. Operating income margins excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs were higher in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2006," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "We continue to provide excellent results while remaining focused on investing for the long-term by improving our client service levels, offering new services, and increasing ancillary services penetration," remarked Mr. Judge. "Our performance metrics of client base growth, check volume, and new-hire reporting were very good for the quarter driving the 9% increase in payroll service revenue. We expect to meet our fiscal 2007 guidance that we provided last quarter."
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 21% to $92.0 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 13% to 39,000 clients; client employees for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services increased 31% to 312,000 client employees; and workers' compensation services client base increased 19% to 54,000 clients. Additionally, the retirement services client employees' funds increased 21% to $6.6 billion.
     Total expenses increased 13% to $273.0 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. Growth in total expenses was a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology. Additionally, we incurred $6.5 million of stock-based compensation costs for the first quarter. Total expense growth would have been 11% excluding stock-based compensation costs.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $186.4 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs increased 14% to $163.1 million and improved as a percent of service revenues to 38% from 37% for the same period last year.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients increased 55% to $29.8 million and corporate investment income increased 94% to $9.4 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2007, is the same as provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2006, except for the inclusion of the effect of the Federal Funds rate increase on June 29, 2006. The Federal Funds rate increases directly effect interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income.
     Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes.

PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
December 20, 2006
SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 20, 2006  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $132.7 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended November 30, 2006 (the "second quarter"), an 18% increase over net income of $112.6 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenue was $454.9 million, a 14% increase over $399.8 million for the same period last year.
     "Fiscal 2007 continues to meet our expectations with another excellent quarter generating record financial results. We are particularly pleased with our growth in service revenue of slightly over 12%, driven by a stable economy and continued growth in our Human Resource Services revenue. Our operating income margins, excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs, were again higher in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as compared to the same period last year," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 24% to $93.0 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 14% to 41,000 clients; client employees for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services increased 31% to 328,000 client employees; and workers' compensation insurance services client base increased 18% to 56,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 25% to $7.2 billion.
     Total expenses increased 13% to $272.6 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. Growth in total expenses was a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology. Additionally, we incurred $5.8 million of stock-based compensation costs for the second quarter. Total expense growth would have been 11% excluding stock-based compensation costs.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $182.3 million, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and stock-based compensation costs increased 15% to $158.4 million and improved as a percent of service revenue to 37% from 36% for the same period last year.
     For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 43% to $29.7 million and corporate investment income increased 79% to $9.9 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
 
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2006 are as follows:
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2007 is unchanged from the guidance provided in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended August 31, 2006.

THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 28, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $126.6 million, or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended February 28, 2007 (the "third quarter"), an 11% increase over net income of $114.5 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. The third quarter results were impacted by an increase to the litigation reserve of $13.0 million, which reduced diluted earnings per share for the third quarter by approximately $0.02 per share.
     "We have enjoyed another excellent quarter and look forward to our seventeenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our third quarter growth in operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients and certain items was very strong at 18%."
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 25% to $102.2 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 15% to 43,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services increased 30% to 350,000 client employees; and workers' compensation insurance services client base increased 16% to 59,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 24% to $7.6 billion.
     Total expenses increased 16% to $312.3 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. Expense growth for the third quarter was impacted by the increase to the litigation reserve. Additionally, we incurred $7.0 million of stock-based compensation costs for the third quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation costs and the increase to the litigation reserve, total expense growth would have been 8%.
     For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 31% to $37.7 million and corporate investment income increased 65% to $10.5 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:

EXHIBIT 99.1
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FISCAL 2007 RESULTS
June 27, 2007
FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, June 27, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $531.6 million, or $1.39 diluted earnings per share, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 ("fiscal 2007"), a 14% increase over net income of $464.9 million, or $1.22 diluted earnings per share, for the prior fiscal year. The fiscal 2007 results were impacted by an increase to the litigation reserve during the three months ended February 28, 2007 of $13.0 million, which reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $0.02 per share. In addition, with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation on June 1, 2006, fiscal 2007 also included $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs.
     "Fiscal 2007 is our seventeenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income. We have experienced record levels of client retention, product penetration, and solid profit results," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Looking back, fiscal 2007 was another excellent year. More importantly, our fiscal 2007 results and investments have us well positioned to meet our long-term financial goals in fiscal 2008 and beyond."
     Payroll service revenue grew 9% to $1.4 billion over the prior fiscal year from client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and penetration of ancillary payroll services. Our client base growth was 3.4% for fiscal 2007. Utilization of our payroll tax administration services was 93% as of May 31, 2007 compared to 92% as of May 31, 2006, and nearly all of our new clients purchase these services. Employee payment services utilization was 71% as of May 31, 2007 compared to 68% as of May 31, 2006, with over 80% of our new clients selecting these services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 22% to $396.2 million for fiscal 2007. This growth was generated from the following sources: retirement services client base increased 16% to 44,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 26% to 373,000 client employees served; and workers' compensation insurance services client base increased 19% to 62,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 34% to $8.5 billion.
     Total expenses increased 13% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2007, in part due to $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs for fiscal 2007 and $13.0 million for the increase to the litigation reserve. Excluding these two items, total expense growth would have been 9% primarily due to increases in personnel and technology as we continue our investments in new products and services.
 
     For fiscal 2007, interest on funds held for clients increased 33% to $134.1 million and corporate investment income increased 66% to $41.8 million. These increases were attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     Net income was $137.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2007 ("fourth quarter"), or $0.36 diluted earnings per share, a 12% increase over net income of $122.7 million for the same period last year. Operating income increased 10% to $184.9 million. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients ($36.8 million) and stock-based compensation costs ($6.4 million) increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $154.5 million.
     Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $487.3 million. Payroll service revenue increased 9% to $343.8 million due to client base growth, check volume growth, price increases, and penetration of ancillary payroll services. Human Resource Services revenue increased 16% to $106.7 million. Excluding revenue from our Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") services, Human Resource Services revenue growth for the fourth quarter would have been 20%. Quarterly comparisons of PEO revenue are impacted by fluctuations in workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, our PEO results in fiscal 2007 have been affected by legislated workers' compensation rate reductions in the state of Florida where the majority of our PEO business is derived.
RAPID PAYROLL, INC. LITIGATION
     During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we recognized $13.0 million of additional expense related to the Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll") litigation that commenced in August 2001, and has been previously disclosed. At the present time, we have fully resolved our licensing responsibility and settled all disputes with seventy-four of the seventy-six licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A verdict favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued with respect to our dispute with one of the remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing the verdict. A verdict was issued earlier today in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that case, a jury awarded $15.0 million to the plaintiffs in compensatory damages and allowed for an additional finding of punitive damages. The amount of any punitive damage award has not yet been determined.
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 is based upon current economic conditions and interest rate levels. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 31.5%.

Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs.
     Our Payroll services are provided through either our Core Payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefit needs, and include:
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per pay period. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services, growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure, and expanding our service offerings.
     Fiscal 2007 was our seventeenth consecutive year of record total revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our financial results for fiscal 2007 included the following highlights:
     During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of $13.0 million to increase our litigation reserve, which reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 per share. On June 1, 2006, we adopted the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and recognized $25.7 million of related expense for fiscal 2007.
 
     In managing and evaluating the results of our day-to-day operations, we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure. We also use this measure in evaluating management's performance in generating those results. Operating income increased 12% to $726.5 million for fiscal 2007. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, stock-based compensation costs, and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve increased 15% to $631.1 million for fiscal 2007. Refer to the reconciliation of operating income to operating income excluding certain items included in "Operating Income" under the "Results of Operations" section of this review.
     Our financial performance for fiscal 2007 was largely due to strong service revenue growth of 11% over the prior fiscal year. This growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services.
     Our financial performance was also positively impacted by the effects of increases in interest rates earned on funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 40% for fiscal 2007 and earned an average rate of return of 4.0%, an increase from 3.2% for fiscal 2006 and 2.2% for fiscal 2005. The Federal Funds rate was raised 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 5.25% as of May 31, 2007. The impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     We continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:
     Our client base increased to approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31, 2007. This compares with approximately 543,000 clients as of May 31, 2006, and approximately 522,000 clients as of May 31, 2005. Client growth was approximately 3.4% for fiscal 2007, compared with approximately 4.0% for fiscal 2006 and approximately 3.5% for fiscal 2005.
Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services:
     We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. The following table summarizes the approximate composition of our direct sales force:
     We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased penetration of our payroll-related and human resource ancillary services and products. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings:
 
     : During fiscal 2007, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of services and products and:
Service and product initiatives
     We will supplement our growth through strategic acquisition when opportunities arise. We currently have no definitive agreements with respect to any material prospective acquisition.
Business acquisitions:
     We have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention. For fiscal 2007, customer survey results were at an all-time high, and client retention was at a record level of slightly more than 80% of our beginning client base.
Focus on customer service:
     As of May 31, 2007, we maintained a strong financial position with cash and total corporate investments of $1.2 billion. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations increased 11% to $631.2 million for fiscal 2007. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is anticipated that cash and current corporate investment balances of $591.1 million as of May 31, 2007, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Financial position:
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, and our financial position as of May 31, 2007, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this review.
Stock-Based Compensation Costs
     Effective June 1, 2006 (the "adoption date"), we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123 (R)"), "Share-Based Payment." This statement requires that all stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. These costs are recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the requisite service period. We adopted this standard using the modified-prospective transition method, and accordingly, results for the prior periods have not been restated. Comparisons between the results of operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are impacted by this method of adoption.
     Prior to the adoption date, we accounted for stock-based compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Accordingly, no compensation costs were recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of the stock options granted was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant.
 
     The impacts to the results of operations for fiscal 2007 from recognition of stock-based compensation costs under SFAS No. 123 (R) are as follows:
     As of May 31, 2007, the total unrecognized compensation cost for all unvested stock-based awards was $60.7 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. The impact on future periods may change based on the issuance of additional stock-based awards as allowed under the Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective October 12, 2005.
     For grants of stock options, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For grants of restricted stock, which were first granted in July 2006, the fair value is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Stock-based compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent to the adoption date are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period to better align the costs with the employee services provided. Compensation costs for stock-based awards granted prior to the adoption date will continue to be recognized on an accelerated amortization schedule related to the graded vesting terms of the grant.
     As part of the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we did an in-depth review of all of our assumptions used in calculating the fair value under a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For grants subsequent to the adoption date, we calculated the estimated volatility factor based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility. We incorporated implied volatility as it is generally more reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. Prior to the adoption date, we used historical volatility based on monthly stock prices. The expected option life of our stock option grants is determined from historical exercise behavior.
     Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Previously, in our pro-forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience.
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to types or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions can have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
 
Outlook
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31.5%. Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2008 are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Fiscal 2008 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately $65 million and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2008 to be approximately $17 million. We estimate that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2008 would be in the range of $5.0 million to $5.5 million for fiscal 2008.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
     Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
     Payroll service revenue increased 9% for fiscal 2007 and 10% for fiscal 2006 to $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The increases in Payroll service revenue were primarily attributable to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services.
Revenue:
     As of May 31, 2007, 93% of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, compared with 92% as of May 31, 2006 and 90% as of May 31, 2005. We believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by 71% of our clients as of May 31, 2007, compared with 68% as of May 31, 2006 and 65% as of May 31, 2005. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients select our employee payment services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 22% for fiscal 2007 and 29% for fiscal 2006 to $396.2 million and $324.9 million, respectively. Revenue from time and attendance products, included in Human Resource Services, increased 15% for fiscal 2007 and 144% for fiscal 2006 to $17.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Additionally, growth was generated from the following:
 
     The increase in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was the result of higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances. The higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were driven by client base growth, wage inflation, check volume growth within our current client base, and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services. See the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review for more information on changing rates.
     The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31:
Combined Operating and SG&A Expenses:
     Stock-based compensation costs from the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), included in compensation-related expenses, were $25.7 million for fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of $13.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters.
     Excluding stock-based compensation costs and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve for fiscal 2007, total expense growth would have been 9% for fiscal 2007 and 12% for fiscal 2006. This growth was a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology. In addition, for fiscal 2006, total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense. As of May 31, 2007, we had approximately 11,700 employees compared with approximately 10,900 as of May 31, 2006 and 10,000 as of May 31, 2005.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. Amortization increased in fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with New England Business Services, Inc. ("NEBS") and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
 
     Operating income growth was 12% for fiscal 2007 and 22% for fiscal 2006. The increases in operating income for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating Income:
     In managing and evaluating the results of our day-to-day operations, we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure. We also use this measure in evaluating management's performance in generating those results. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, stock-based compensation costs, and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is as follows:
     Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The increase in investment income for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, was mainly due to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations.
Investment Income, Net:
     Our effective income tax rate was 30.8% for fiscal 2007, compared with 31.1% for fiscal 2006, and 32.5% for fiscal 2005. The decreases in our effective income tax rate were primarily the result of higher levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios, and a lower effective state income tax rate. For fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible compensation related to incentive stock option grants.
Income Taxes:
     Net income growth was 14% for fiscal 2007 and 26% for fiscal 2006 to $531.6 million and $464.9 million, respectively. These increases were attributable to the factors previously discussed, including, in fiscal 2007, the increase to the litigation reserve of $13.0 million and the $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs due to the June 1, 2006 accounting standard adoption.
Net Income:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     As of May 31, 2007, we had $1.2 billion in cash and total corporate investments. Cash and current corporate investments of $591.1 million and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     We have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:
 
     Our credit facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2007 or as of May 31, 2007.
     As of May 31, 2007, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $62.4 million, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. These letters of credit expire at various dates between December 2007 and July 2008. The letters are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolio, including a $53.5 million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2007 or as of May 31, 2007.
     We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2007. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2007:
     Advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was $15.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively.
 
     We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
     We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
Rapid Payroll, Inc. Litigation
     During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we recognized $13.0 million of additional expense related to the Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll") litigation that commenced in August 2001, and has been previously disclosed. At the present time, we have fully resolved our licensing responsibility and settled all disputes with seventy-four of the seventy-six licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A verdict favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued with respect to our dispute with one of the remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing the verdict. A verdict was issued earlier today in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that case, a jury awarded $15.0 million to the plaintiffs in compensatory damages and allowed for an additional finding of punitive damages. The amount of any punitive damage award has not yet been determined.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation costs of $25.7 million and the expense charge of $13.0 million to increase the litigation reserve. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
 
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
     The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. Construction in progress totaled $46.5 million and $36.3 million as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these costs, $39.5 million and $29.4 million represent software being developed for internal use as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use, at which time we will begin amortization of the costs.
Purchases of long-lived assets:
     During fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, we purchased approximately $2.8 million, $4.6 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the "Board.") Other assets increased for fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with NEBS and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     In October 2006, our Board approved an increase of 31% in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.21 per share from $0.16 per share. In October 2005, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.16 per share from $0.13 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 57%, 50%, and 52% for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
     The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, was primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 were 1.8 million shares compared with 1.7 million shares for fiscal 2006 and 0.7 million shares for fiscal 2005. We have recognized an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $9.7 million for fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (R), as adopted on June 1, 2006. For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we recognized tax benefits related to exercise of stock options of $11.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively, that are reflected in cash flows from operating activities.

FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of June 1, 2007, as required. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this interpretation and its guidance on application, we currently estimate the adoption of FIN 48 will increase the reserve for unrecognized tax positions by approximately $8.0 million, primarily related to state income tax matters. This increase will be recorded as a decrease to opening retained earnings as of June 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is also expected to impact our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008, increasing it by approximately 50 basis points.
     In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48." This FSP amends FIN 48 to provide guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively (as opposed to "ultimately") settled through examination, negotiation, or litigation. We will apply the guidance in this FSP upon adoption of FIN 48 in June 2007.
     In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-6, "Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)." This FSP provides additional guidance on the determination of and accounting for variable interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). This FSP was effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2006 and we implemented its guidance beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 relative to our limited partner investments in low-income housing projects. The adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not yet determined the effect, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our results of operations or financial position.
     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans." This statement requires an employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year of change through comprehensive income. The statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. We currently do not have any benefit plans subject to this new statement and, therefore, expect no impact on our results of operations or financial position.
     In October 2006, the FASB issued FSPs related to SFAS No. 123 (R) as follows:
     Both FSPs are effective in the first reporting period beginning after the date the FSP is posted to the FASB website, which for us was the three months ended February 28, 2007. The adoption of these FSPs did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115." This statement allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We currently do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
     Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
     Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
     In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustments to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted up to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
     Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we utilize an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
 
     We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
     In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $750,000 under both the fiscal 2007 policy and the fiscal 2006 policy.
     We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers' compensation claims as of:
     Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at market value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income, net of tax. However, changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities with an A-1 rating, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment.
     For business combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software and intangible assets, we use the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets:
     We have $407.7 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007, resulting from acquisitions during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2003, 2004, and 2007. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was
 
recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
     We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
     We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
     We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. As of May 31, 2007, we had approximately $7.5 million of reserves for pending litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Contingent liabilities:
     Effective June 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), which requires that all stock-based awards to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option life. We estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior.
Stock-based compensation costs:
     Under SFAS No. 123 (R), we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catch-up adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
     We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
 
     We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) in fiscal 2007, we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefit related to stock-based awards.
Income taxes:
Market Risk Factors
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities, we generally direct investments towards high credit quality, fixed-rate municipal and government securities and manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. During fiscal 2007, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 4.0% compared with 3.2% for fiscal 2006 and 2.2% for fiscal 2005. Short-term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2006, with the Federal Funds rate increasing 200 basis points to 5.00% as of May 31, 2006. The Federal Funds rate was increased 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 5.25% as of May 31, 2007. While interest rates are rising, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as discussed below.
     During a rising interest rate environment, the increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short-term investments, and over time will increase earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2007 had an average duration of 2.5 years, excluding the impact of auction rate securities and VRDNs that are tied to short-term interest rates, would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates.
     The cost and market value of available-for-sale securities that have stated maturities as of May 31, 2007 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
     VRDNs and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature.
 
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:
     Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.4 billion for fiscal 2007. Our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60% invested in short-term securities and available-for-sale securities with an average duration of 35 days, and 40% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss position of $14.9 million as of May 31, 2007, compared with a net unrealized loss position of $22.0 million as of May 31, 2006. During fiscal 2007, the net unrealized loss position ranged from $29.5 million to $1.1 million. During fiscal 2006, the net unrealized loss position ranged from $25.2 million to $6.1 million. The net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately $21.8 million as of June 22, 2007.
     As of May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, we had $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at market value. Excluding auction rate securities and VRDNs classified as available-for-sale securities which are tied to short-term interest rates, the weighted-average yields to maturity were 3.7% and 3.0%, as of May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities as of May 31, 2007, would be approximately $12.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity. These fluctuations in market value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in market value were considered to be other-than-temporary.
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with an A-1 rating, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.

EXHIBIT 99.1
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS REVISED FISCAL 2007 RESULTS
July 11, 2007
     ROCHESTER, NY, July 11, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," "us," or the "Company") (NASDAQ:PAYX) has revised its previously announced earnings for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 ("fiscal 2007") to recognize an additional expense charge of $25.0 million to increase its litigation reserve during the three months ended May 31, 2007 (the "fourth quarter"). Disputes involving Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, arose in August 2001. These disputes resulted in litigation, as has been previously disclosed by the Company. At the present time, the Company has fully resolved its licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A decision favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the United States District Court for the Central District of California with respect to the Company's dispute with one of the remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing the case. A verdict was issued on June 27, 2007 in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that case, a California Superior Court, Los Angeles County (the "Superior Court") jury awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages.
     "We are disappointed with the recent jury decisions in the Superior Court. We believe there are substantial bases to reduce or overturn the verdict by post-trial motions to the trial court and, if necessary, on appeal. We will continue to defend our position and remain committed to resolving this case," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer.
REVISED FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     Net income of $515.4 million, or $1.35 diluted earnings per share, for fiscal 2007, increased 11% over net income of $464.9 million, or $1.22 diluted earnings per share for the prior fiscal year. The fiscal 2007 results were impacted by the increases to the litigation reserve totaling $38.0 million, which reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $0.06 per share. In addition, with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation on June 1, 2006, fiscal 2007 also included $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs.
     For fiscal 2007, operating income increased 8% to $701.5 million. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, stock-based compensation costs, and the increases to the litigation reserve increased 15% to $631.1 million for fiscal 2007. Total expenses increased 16% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2007. Stock-based compensation costs of $25.7 million for fiscal 2007 and increases to the litigation reserve of $38.0 million account for approximately 7% of the 16% increase in total expenses. Increases in personnel and technology as we continue our investments in new products and services account for most of the remaining increase in expenses.
REVISED FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     Net income was $121.1 million for the fourth quarter, or $0.32 diluted earnings per share, down slightly from net income of $122.7 million for the same period last year. Operating income was $159.9 million. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients ($36.8 million), stock-based compensation costs ($6.4 million), and the increase to the litigation reserve ($25.0 million) was up 14% for the fourth quarter to $154.5 million.
 
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 is based upon current economic conditions and interest rate levels. The outlook is unchanged from that included in our June 27, 2007 press release except for net income, which has been impacted by the expense charge of $25.0 million to increase the litigation reserve. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 31.5%.

"SAFE HARBOR" STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995
     Certain written and oral statements made by us may constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the "Reform Act"). Forward-looking statements are identified by such words and phrases as "we expect," "expected to," "estimates," "estimated," "current outlook," "we look forward to," "would equate to," "projects," "projections," "projected to be," "anticipates," "anticipated," "we believe," "could be," and other similar phrases. All statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth, earnings, earnings-per-share growth, or similar projections, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light of important risk factors. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following risks, as well as those that are described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"): general market and economic conditions, including, among others, changes in United States employment and wage levels, changes in new hiring trends, changes in short- and long-term interest rates, and changes in the market value and the credit rating of securities held by us; changes in demand for our products and services, ability to develop and market new products and services effectively, pricing changes and impact of competition, and the availability of skilled workers; changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee benefits, including retirement plans, worker's compensation, state unemployment, and section 125 plans; changes in Professional Employer Organization direct costs, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation rates and underlying claims trends; the possibility of failure to keep pace with technological changes and provide timely enhancements to products and services; the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event; the possibility of third-party service providers failing to perform their functions; the possibility of penalties and losses resulting from errors and omissions in performing services; the possible inability of our clients to meet their payroll obligations; the possible failure of internal controls or our inability to implement business processing improvements; and potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal matters.

PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FISCAL 2007 RESULTS
June 27, 2007
FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, June 27, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," "us," or the "Company") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $515.4 million, or $1.35 diluted earnings per share, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007 ("fiscal 2007"), an 11% increase over net income of $464.9 million, or $1.22 diluted earnings per share, for the prior fiscal year. The fiscal 2007 results were impacted by an increase to the litigation reserve of $38.0 million, which reduced diluted earnings per share for the year by approximately $0.06 per share. In addition, with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation on June 1, 2006, fiscal 2007 also included $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs.
     "Fiscal 2007 is our seventeenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income. We have experienced record levels of client retention, product penetration, and solid profit results," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Looking back, fiscal 2007 was another excellent year. More importantly, our fiscal 2007 results and investments have us well positioned to meet our long-term financial goals in fiscal 2008 and beyond."
     Payroll service revenue grew 9% to $1.4 billion over the prior fiscal year from client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and penetration of ancillary payroll services. Our client base growth was 3.4% for fiscal 2007. Utilization of our payroll tax administration services was 93% as of May 31, 2007 compared to 92% as of May 31, 2006, and nearly all of our new clients purchase these services. Employee payment services utilization was 71% as of May 31, 2007 compared to 68% as of May 31, 2006, with over 80% of our new clients selecting these services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 22% to $396.2 million for fiscal 2007. This growth was generated from the following sources: retirement services client base increased 16% to 44,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 26% to 373,000 client employees served; and workers' compensation insurance services client base increased 19% to 62,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 34% to $8.5 billion.
     Total expenses increased 16% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2007, in part due to $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs for fiscal 2007 and $38.0 million for the increase to the litigation reserve. Excluding these two items, total expense growth would have been 9% primarily due to increases in personnel and technology as we continue our investments in new products and services.
 
     For fiscal 2007, interest on funds held for clients increased 33% to $134.1 million and corporate investment income increased 66% to $41.7 million. These increases were attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2007 HIGHLIGHTS
     Net income was $121.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2007 ("fourth quarter"), or $0.32 diluted earnings per share, a slight decrease from net income of $122.7 million for the same period last year. Operating income was $159.9 million. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients ($36.8 million), stock-based compensation costs ($6.4 million), and an increase to the litigation reserve ($25.0 million) grew 14% for the fourth quarter to $154.5 million.
     Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 11% to $487.3 million. Payroll service revenue increased 9% to $343.8 million due to client base growth, check volume growth, price increases, and penetration of ancillary payroll services. Human Resource Services revenue increased 16% to $106.7 million. Excluding revenue from our Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") services, Human Resource Services revenue growth for the fourth quarter would have been 20%. Quarterly comparisons of PEO revenue are impacted by fluctuations in workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, our PEO results in fiscal 2007 have been affected by legislated workers' compensation rate reductions in the state of Florida where the majority of our PEO business is derived.
RAPID PAYROLL, INC. LITIGATION
     During fiscal 2007, we recognized $38.0 million of additional expense to increase our litigation reserve. Disputes involving Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, arose in August 2001. These disputes resulted in litigation, as has been previously disclosed. At the present time, the Company fully resolved its licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A decision favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the United States District Court for the Central District of California with respect to the Company's dispute with one of the remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing the case. A verdict was issued on June 27, 2007 in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that case, a California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages.
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 is based upon current economic conditions and interest rate levels. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 31.5%.

Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs.
     Our Payroll services are provided through either our Core Payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, utilization of ancillary services, and checks or transactions per client per pay period. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services, growing our client base, increasing utilization of our ancillary services, leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure, and expanding our service offerings.
     Fiscal 2007 was our seventeenth consecutive year of record total revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share. Our financial results for fiscal 2007 included the following highlights:
     During the fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve, which reduced diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per share. Disputes involving Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex, Inc., arose in August 2001. These disputes resulted in litigation, as has been previously disclosed. At the present time, we have fully resolved our licensing responsibility and settled all litigation with 74 of the 76 licensees who were provided services by Rapid Payroll. A decision
 
favorable to Paychex, Inc. was issued by the United States District Court for the Central District of California with respect to our dispute with one of the remaining two licensees. That licensee is currently appealing the case. A verdict was issued on June 27, 2007 in litigation brought by the other remaining licensee. In that case, a California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages.
     On June 1, 2006, we adopted the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation and recognized $25.7 million of related expense for fiscal 2007.
     In managing and evaluating the results of our day-to-day operations, we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure. We also use this measure in evaluating management's performance in generating those results. Operating income increased 8% to $701.5 million for fiscal 2007. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, stock-based compensation costs, and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve increased 15% to $631.1 million for fiscal 2007. Refer to the reconciliation of operating income to operating income excluding certain items included in "Operating Income" under the "Results of Operations" section of this review.
     Our financial performance for fiscal 2007 was largely due to strong service revenue growth of 11% over the prior fiscal year. This growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services.
     Our financial performance was also positively impacted by the effects of increases in interest rates earned on funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income increased 40% for fiscal 2007 and earned an average rate of return of 4.0%, an increase from 3.2% for fiscal 2006 and 2.2% for fiscal 2005. The Federal Funds rate was raised 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 5.25% as of May 31, 2007. The impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     We continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:
     Our client base increased to approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31, 2007. This compares with approximately 543,000 clients as of May 31, 2006, and approximately 522,000 clients as of May 31, 2005. Client growth was approximately 3.4% for fiscal 2007, compared with approximately 4.0% for fiscal 2006 and approximately 3.5% for fiscal 2005.
Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services:
     We have continued to invest in our direct sales force, as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. The following table summarizes the approximate composition of our direct sales force:
 
     We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased penetration of our payroll-related and human resource ancillary services and products. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings:
     : During fiscal 2007, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of services and products and:
Service and product initiatives
     We will supplement our growth through strategic acquisition when opportunities arise. We currently have no definitive agreements with respect to any material prospective acquisition.
Business acquisitions:
     We have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention. For fiscal 2007, customer survey results were at an all-time high and client retention was at a record level of slightly more than 80% of our beginning client base.
Focus on customer service:
     As of May 31, 2007, we maintained a strong financial position with cash and total corporate investments of $1.2 billion. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations increased 11% to $631.2 million for fiscal 2007. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is anticipated that cash and current corporate investment balances of $591.1 million as of May 31, 2007, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Financial position:
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, and our financial position as of May 31, 2007, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this review.
Stock-Based Compensation Costs
     Effective June 1, 2006 (the "adoption date"), we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123 (R)"), "Share-Based Payment." This statement requires that all stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. These costs are recognized as expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the requisite service period. We adopted this standard using the modified-prospective transition method, and accordingly, results for the prior periods have not been restated. Comparisons between the results of operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are impacted by this method of adoption.
 
     Prior to the adoption date, we accounted for stock-based compensation arrangements under the intrinsic value method described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Accordingly, no compensation costs were recognized for stock option grants because the exercise price of the stock options granted was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant.
     The impacts to the results of operations for fiscal 2007 from recognition of stock-based compensation costs under SFAS No. 123 (R) are as follows:
     As of May 31, 2007, the total unrecognized compensation cost for all unvested stock-based awards was $60.7 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. The impact on future periods may change based on the issuance of additional stock-based awards as allowed under the Paychex, Inc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective October 12, 2005.
     For grants of stock options, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For grants of restricted stock, which were first granted in July 2006, the fair value is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Stock-based compensation costs for any awards granted subsequent to the adoption date are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period to better align the costs with the employee services provided. Compensation costs for stock-based awards granted prior to the adoption date will continue to be recognized on an accelerated amortization schedule related to the graded vesting terms of the grant.
     As part of the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we did an in-depth review of all of our assumptions used in calculating the fair value under a Black-Scholes option pricing model. For grants subsequent to the adoption date, we calculated the estimated volatility factor based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility. We incorporated implied volatility as it is generally more reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. Prior to the adoption date, we used historical volatility based on monthly stock prices. The expected option life of our stock option grants is determined from historical exercise behavior.
     Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Previously, in our pro-forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience.
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to types or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions can have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
 
Outlook
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008") is based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 31.5%. Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2008 are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Fiscal 2008 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately $65 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2008 to be approximately $17 million. We estimate that the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in interest rates (17 basis points for tax-exempt investments) at the beginning of fiscal 2008 would be in the range of $5.0 million to $5.5 million for fiscal 2008.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
     Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
     Payroll service revenue increased 9% for fiscal 2007 and 10% for fiscal 2006 to $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The increases in Payroll service revenue were primarily attributable to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services.
Revenue:
     As of May 31, 2007, 93% of all clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, compared with 92% as of May 31, 2006 and 90% as of May 31, 2005. We believe our client utilization percentage of these services is near maturity. Our employee payment services were utilized by 71% of our clients as of May 31, 2007, compared with 68% as of May 31, 2006 and 65% as of May 31, 2005. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients select a form of our employee payment services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 22% for fiscal 2007 and 29% for fiscal 2006 to $396.2 million and $324.9 million, respectively. Revenue from time and attendance products, included in Human Resource Services, increased 15% for fiscal 2007 and 144% for fiscal 2006 to $17.2 million and $15.0 million, respectively. Additionally, growth was generated from the following:
 
     The increase in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was the result of higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances. The higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were driven by client base growth, wage inflation, check volume growth within our current client base, and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services. See the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review for more information on changing rates.
     The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31:
Combined Operating and SG&A Expenses:
     Stock-based compensation costs from the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), included in compensation-related expenses, were $25.7 million for fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters.
     The stock-based compensation costs and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve accounted for 7% of the 16% increase in total expenses for fiscal 2007. Most of the remaining increase in total expenses for fiscal 2007 and the increase for fiscal 2006 were attributable to increases in personnel and other costs related to retaining clients, promoting new services, and creating more efficient systems for selling and servicing through new and enhanced technology. In addition, for fiscal 2006, total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense. As of May 31, 2007, we had approximately 11,700 employees compared with approximately 10,900 as of May 31, 2006 and 10,000 as of May 31, 2005.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. Amortization increased in fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with New England Business Services, Inc. ("NEBS") and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
 
     Operating income growth was 8% for fiscal 2007 and 22% for fiscal 2006. The increases in operating income for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating Income:
     In managing and evaluating the results of our day-to-day operations, we believe that operating income excluding certain items is an appropriate measure. We also use this measure in evaluating management's performance in generating those results. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, stock-based compensation costs, and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is as follows for the year ended May 31:
     Investment income, net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The increase in investment income for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, was mainly due to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations.
Investment Income, Net:
     Our effective income tax rate was 30.7% for fiscal 2007, compared with 31.1% for fiscal 2006, and 32.5% for fiscal 2005. The decreases in our effective income tax rate were primarily the result of higher levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios, and a lower effective state income tax rate. For fiscal 2007, the effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible compensation related to incentive stock option grants.
Income Taxes:
     Net income growth was 11% for fiscal 2007 and 26% for fiscal 2006 to $515.4 million and $464.9 million, respectively. These increases were attributable to the factors previously discussed, including, in fiscal 2007, the increase to the litigation reserve of $38.0 million and the $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs due to the June 1, 2006 accounting standard adoption.
Net Income:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     As of May 31, 2007, we had $1.2 billion in cash and total corporate investments. Cash and current corporate investments of $591.1 million and projected operating cash flows are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     We have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:
 
     Our credit facilities are evidenced by Promissory Notes and are secured by separate Pledge Security Agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a Control Agreement and is to be administered under an Intercreditor Agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2007 or as of May 31, 2007.
     As of May 31, 2007, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $62.4 million, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. These letters of credit expire at various dates between December 2007 and July 2008. The letters are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolio, including a $53.5 million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2007 or as of May 31, 2007.
     We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2007. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2007:
 
     Advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was $15.2 million and $14.5 million, respectively.
 
     We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
     We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to stock-based compensation costs of $25.7 million and the expense charge of $38.0 million to increase the litigation reserve. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of accounts receivable billing and collection, and timing of payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
 
Investing Cash Flow Activities
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
     The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of corporate investments. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. Construction in progress totaled $46.5 million and $36.3 million as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of these costs, $39.5 million and $29.4 million represent software being developed for internal use as of May 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use, at which time we will begin amortization of the costs.
Purchases of long-lived assets:
     During fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, we purchased approximately $2.8 million, $4.6 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the "Board.") Other assets increased for fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with NEBS and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     In October 2006, our Board approved an increase of 31% in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.21 per share from $0.16 per share. In October 2005, our Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.16 per share from $0.13 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 58%, 50%, and 52% for fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
 
     The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, and for fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005, was primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal 2007 were 1.8 million shares compared with 1.7 million shares for fiscal 2006 and 0.7 million shares for fiscal 2005. We have recognized an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $9.7 million for fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in accordance with SFAS No. 123 (R), as adopted on June 1, 2006. For fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, we recognized tax benefits related to exercise of stock options of $11.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively, that are reflected in cash flows from operating activities.
Exercise of stock options:

     In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109," to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income tax by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of June 1, 2007, as required. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this interpretation and its guidance on application, we currently estimate the adoption of FIN 48 will increase the reserve for unrecognized tax positions by approximately $8.0 million, primarily related to state income tax matters. This increase will be recorded as a decrease to opening retained earnings as of June 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 is also expected to impact our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008, increasing it by approximately 50 basis points.
New accounting pronouncements:
     In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48." This FSP amends FIN 48 to provide guidance that a company may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively (as opposed to "ultimately") settled through examination, negotiation, or litigation. We will apply the guidance in this FSP upon adoption of FIN 48 in June 2007.
     In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-6, "Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)." This FSP provides additional guidance on the determination of and accounting for variable interests under FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). This FSP was effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2006 and we implemented its guidance beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 relative to our limited partner investments in low-income housing projects. The adoption of this FSP did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not yet determined the effect, if any, the adoption of this statement will have on our results of operations or financial position.
     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plans." This statement requires an employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year of change through comprehensive income. The statement is effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. We currently do not have any benefit plans subject to this new statement and, therefore, expect no impact on our results of operations or financial position.
     In October 2006, the FASB issued FSPs related to SFAS No. 123 (R) as follows:
 
     Both FSPs are effective in the first reporting period beginning after the date the FSP is posted to the FASB website, which for us was the three months ended February 28, 2007. The adoption of these FSPs did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115." This statement allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We currently do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
Critical Accounting Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
     Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred for PEO worksite employees were $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.2 billion for fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
     Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
     In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustments to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted up to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collection, holding, and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
 
     Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we utilize an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
     We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
     In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $750,000 under both the fiscal 2007 policy and the fiscal 2006 policy.
     We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers' compensation claims:
     Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at market value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income, net of tax. However, changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities with an A-1 rating, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single user. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment.
 
     For business combinations, we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, such as customer lists, certain license agreements, trade names, and non-compete agreements. The assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions. For certain fixed assets, including software and intangible assets, we use the assistance of independent valuation consultants. The remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and intangible assets:
     We have $407.7 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2007, resulting from acquisitions during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2003, 2004, and 2007. SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," requires that goodwill not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We perform our annual review at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
     We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
     We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
     We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. As of May 31, 2007, we had approximately $32.5 million of reserves for pending litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Contingent liabilities:
     Effective June 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), which requires that all stock-based awards to employees, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option life. We estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior.
Stock-based compensation costs:
     Under SFAS No. 123 (R), we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catch-up adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
 
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
     We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
     We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R) in fiscal 2007, we record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefit related to stock-based awards.
Income taxes:
Market Risk Factors
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially effect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities, we generally direct investments towards high credit quality, fixed-rate municipal and government securities and manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. During fiscal 2007, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 4.0% compared with 3.2% for fiscal 2006 and 2.2% for fiscal 2005. Short-term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal 2006, with the Federal Funds rate increasing 200 basis points to 5.00% as of May 31, 2006. The Federal Funds rate increased 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and was 5.25% as of May 31, 2007. While interest rates are rising, the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as discussed below.
     During a rising interest rate environment, the increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short-term investments, and over time will increase earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2007 had an average duration of 2.5 years, excluding the impact of auction rate securities and VRDNs that are tied to short-term interest rates, would not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates.
 
     The cost and market value of available-for-sale securities that have stated maturities as of May 31, 2007 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
     VRDNs and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature.
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:
     Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.4 billion for fiscal 2007. Our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 60% invested in short-term securities and available-for-sale securities with an average duration of 35 days, and 40% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss position of $14.9 million as of May 31, 2007, compared with a net unrealized loss position of $22.0 million as of May 31, 2006. During fiscal 2007, the net unrealized loss position ranged from $29.5 million to $1.1 million. During fiscal 2006, the net unrealized loss position ranged from $25.2 million to $6.1 million. The net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately $21.8 million as of June 22, 2007.
 
     As of May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, we had $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at market value. Excluding auction rate securities and VRDNs classified as available-for-sale securities which are tied to short-term interest rates, the weighted-average yields to maturity were 3.7% and 3.0%, as of May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively. Assuming a hypothetical increase in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities as of May 31, 2007, would be approximately $12.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value. This hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity. These fluctuations in market value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in market value were considered to be other-than-temporary.
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds. We attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with an A-1 rating, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.

Further Information
Additional information regarding compensation awarded to certain of the Company's executive officers for the year ended May 31, 2007 will be provided in the Company's proxy statement for its 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in August 2007.
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
The following exhibits relating to Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K are filed herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

 
EXHIBIT 10.1
     1. . This 2007-2008 Officer Performance Incentive Award Agreement (this "Award Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of the Performance Award (the "Award") granted to you by the Governance and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") under the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective October 12, 2005 (the "Plan").

Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Value
          (e) .

EXHIBIT 99.1
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
September 26, 2007
First Quarter Fiscal 2008 Highlights:
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 26, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $151.1 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended August 31, 2007 (the "first quarter"), a 12% increase over net income of $135.1 million, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, for the same period last year. Total revenue was $507.1 million, a 10% increase over $459.4 million for the same period last year.
     "We continued our tradition of record financial results as demonstrated by an excellent first quarter, on track to achieve our eighteenth consecutive year of record revenues and net income," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position have allowed us to continue to support our ongoing operations while returning value to our stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We increased our quarterly dividend by 43% and commenced a program to repurchase $1.0 billion of our common stock, reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities of our business. In the first quarter, we repurchased $396.5 million of our common stock for a total of 8.9 million shares and we expect to complete the stock repurchase program in 2007," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $361.5 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The increase was due to client base growth, higher check volume, and price increases.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 20% to $113.3 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 18% to 45,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 22% to 381,000 client employees served; and workers' compensation insurance client base increased 19% to 65,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 30% to $8.5 billion.
     Total expenses increased 9% to $296.5 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. Growth in total expenses was a result of increases in personnel related to selling to new clients, retaining clients, and promoting new services.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $210.6 million, an increase of 13% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients increased 14% to $178.3 million and improved as a percent of service revenues to 38% from 36% for the same period last year.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% to $32.3 million and corporate investment income increased 30% to $12.2 million, attributable to higher average interest rates and higher average investment balances, as summarized below:
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
     In July 2007, we announced our program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of Paychex, Inc. common stock. Through September 26, 2007, we repurchased 11.2 million shares for a total of $500.0 million. Subject to changes in market conditions, we expect to complete our repurchase program in 2007 and anticipate that our weighted average outstanding shares for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008") will be approximately 370 million.
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for fiscal 2008 has been revised from that provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") for the year ended May 31, 2007, incorporating the anticipated impact of lower investment income as a result of funding the stock repurchase program. In addition, this revised guidance reflects the 50 basis point decrease in the Federal Funds rate announced on September 18, 2007. Our anticipated effective income tax rate increased as a result of the lower expected tax-exempt income earned on our investment portfolios as well as the adoption of new accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Projected revenue and net income growth is as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 32.5%.

     On November 30, 2007, Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex") entered into a new three-year employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer and President, Jonathan J. Judge (the "Agreement"). Mr. Judge's prior three-year employment agreement expired in October 2007.
     Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, Mr. Judge will receive an annual base salary of $915,000, subject to annual review and increase (but not decrease) by the Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"). He will be eligible for a cash incentive bonus pursuant to the 2007-2008 Officer Performance Incentive Award Agreement, based on achievement of certain operating and qualitative objectives. In addition, Mr. Judge will be eligible for a qualitative bonus of up to 20% of his annual base salary as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. For subsequent periods during the term of the Agreement, annual incentive bonus plans and objectives will be determined at the sole discretion of the Committee. It is anticipated that the plans and objectives for such subsequent periods will generally follow the plans and objectives for fiscal year 2008.
     The Committee may also, in its sole discretion, grant Mr. Judge equity awards based upon his performance and/or availability of shares for awards.
     Paychex may terminate Mr. Judge's employment with or without "Cause" as defined in the Agreement. In the event Paychex terminates Mr. Judge's employment for any reason other than for "Cause" or if Mr. Judge resigns for "Good Reason" as defined in the Agreement, he will be paid a lump sum equal to one year's cash compensation, consisting of his annual base salary plus an annual incentive bonus determined at the same percentage of plan applicable for the immediately preceding fiscal year without proration. Any options, restricted stock or other equity awards granted prior to July 1, 2007 that have not previously vested will vest and become exercisable immediately. However, if such termination occurs within one year after a "Change of Control" as defined in the Agreement, any options, restricted stock or other equity awards will vest and become exercisable immediately, regardless of when granted.
     Mr. Judge will also be entitled to COBRA premiums for medical insurance benefits pursuant to the benefit plans in effect at the time of the termination for twelve months following the date of termination.
     If Mr. Judge's employment is terminated for "Cause" or by Mr. Judge without "Good Reason," the Agreement will terminate and Mr. Judge will receive accrued salary, vacation and any earned but unpaid bonus.
     The Agreement also contains certain confidentiality provisions applicable to Mr. Judge during the term of his employment and following termination of his employment.
     The description of Agreement contained in this Item 5.02 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K ("Form 8-K") and incorporated herein by reference.

For subsequent periods during the Employment Period, Annual Bonus plans and objectives will be subject to prior review and input by Executive, but shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board.

Company shall pay to Executive, upon the expiration of six months after the Date of Termination, or as soon thereafter as is administratively feasible, but no longer than ninety days after such due date, the aggregate of one (1) year's Annual Base Salary, plus an Annual Bonus determined at the same percentage of Plan as was the case for the bonus determination for the immediately preceding fiscal year (and without pro-ration).
               (ii) Any options, restricted stock or other equity granted prior to July 1, 2007 that have not previously vested shall vest and become exercisable immediately. Provided, however, that if such termination occurs within one (1) year after a Change of Control, any options, restricted stock or other equity shall vest and become exercisable immediately, regardless of when granted.

          (b) . If Executive's employment is terminated during the Employment Period (i) by Company for Cause, or (ii) by Executive without Good Reason, this Agreement shall terminate without further obligations of Company to Executive or his legal representatives under this Agreement, other than Company's obligations for accrued salary, vacation and any earned and unpaid bonus.

Executive acknowledges that damages would be inadequate and insufficient. This Section 6 shall survive any termination of Executive's employment or of this Agreement.
     7. .

SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 19, 2007  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $147.1 million for the three months ended November 30, 2007 (the "second quarter"), an 11% increase over net income of $132.7 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, an increase of 14% over $0.35 per share for the same period last year. Total revenue was $507.8 million, a 12% increase over $455.0 million for the same period last year.
     "Fiscal 2008 continues to meet our expectations and we experienced excellent margins, with operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients improving 17% over the same period last year," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our results for the second quarter were strong and included the acquisition of Hawthorne Benefit Technologies, Inc., whose BeneTrac, a web-based benefits management and administration system, contributed to the growth in Human Resource Services revenue.
     "We are also pleased to announce the completion of our $1.0 billion stock repurchase program on December 14, 2007, for a total of 23.7 million shares of common stock, with fiscal year 2008 weighted-average outstanding shares expected to be 370 million," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue increased 9% to $361.6 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. The increase was due to client base growth, higher check volume, and price increases.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 24% to $115.5 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 17% to 46,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 22% to 401,000 client employees served; and the workers' compensation insurance client base increased 19% to 67,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 24% to $8.9 billion.
     Total expenses increased 9% to $298.3 million for the second quarter from the same period last year as a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $209.5 million, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients increased 17% to $178.7 million and improved as a percent of service revenues to 37% from 36% for the same period last year.
     For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 4% to $30.7 million attributable primarily to higher average investment balances. Corporate investment income decreased 25% to $7.5 million due to lower average investment balances resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program, offset by higher average interest rates earned.
 
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2007 are as follows:
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 has been revised to reflect slightly lower payroll service revenue growth and the decreases in the Federal Funds rate of 100 basis points since June 1, 2007. Our projections are based on current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Projected revenue and net income growth are as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 32%.

THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 26, 2008 - Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced a 13% increase in its record net income to $142.5 million for the three months ended February 29, 2008 (the "third quarter"), as compared with net income of $126.6 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.39, an increase of 18% over $0.33 per share for the same period last year. Total revenue was $532.2 million, a 10% increase over $485.3 million for the same period last year.
     "Third quarter results met our expectations and we expect to achieve our eighteenth consecutive year of record revenue and net income for fiscal 2008," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Our operating income, net of certain items, was very strong for the third quarter, increasing 17% over the same period last year. However, we are seeing signs of a weakening economy indicated by a more difficult than normal third quarter selling season and increases in business failures. On a positive note, checks per client have not yet shown significant weakness."
     Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $374.2 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The increase was due to client base growth, higher check volume, and price increases.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 18% to $120.6 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated from the following: retirement services client base increased 10% to 47,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 17% to 409,000 client employees served; and workers' compensation insurance client base increased 19% to 70,000 clients. Additionally, the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 19% to $9.1 billion.
     Total expenses increased 3% to $321.8 million for the third quarter from the same period last year as a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services. Excluding a $13.0 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve during the three months ended February 28, 2007, expenses would have increased 8%.
     For the third quarter, our operating income was $210.4 million, an increase of 22% over the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1) increased 17% to $173.0 million as compared to $148.3 million for the same period last year. As a percent of service revenues, operating income, net of certain items, improved to 35% from 33% for the same period last year.
 
     For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 1% to $37.4 million attributable primarily to lower average interest rates earned, offset by higher realized gains and higher average investment balances. Corporate investment income decreased 66% to $3.6 million due to lower average investment balances, resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program, and lower average interest rates earned.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities. We have no exposure to any sub-prime mortgage securities, auction rate securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, structured investment vehicles (SIVs), or insured variable rate demand notes, with the exception of Financial Security Assurance ("FSA"). We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and have never experienced a failed auction. Our variable rate demand notes are rated A-1/P-1 and have no exposure to municipal bond insurers (except FSA), and must carry an irrevocable letter of credit or standby purchase agreement issued by highly rated financial institutions.
Note 1: In addition to reporting operating income, a generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the nine months ended February 29, 2008 are as follows:
Page 2 of 6
 
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008") has been revised to reflect the current Federal Funds rate of 2.25%, and current economic conditions. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. As disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") for the three months ended February 29, 2008, the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point change in the Federal Funds rate at the present time is estimated to be approximately $4.5 million, after taxes, for the next twelve-month period. Projected revenue and net income growth are as follows:
     The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 33%.

FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, June 26, 2008  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced record net income of $576.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008"), a 12% increase over net income of $515.4 million for the prior fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.56, an increase of 16% over $1.35 per share for the prior fiscal year. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, a 10% increase over $1.9 billion for the prior fiscal year.
     "Fiscal 2008 is our eighteenth consecutive year of record revenues, net income, and earnings per share," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "This year is a milestone for us as total revenue exceeded $2 billion for the first time. In addition, we have realized solid profits during a period of declining interest rates as the Federal Funds rate decreased 325 basis points since June 1, 2007. We are very proud of the efforts of all our employees in managing the business this past fiscal year."
     Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $1.5 billion over the prior fiscal year from client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in the utilization of ancillary services. Our client base growth was 2% for fiscal 2008. As of May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, 93% of our clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, and nearly all of our new clients purchase these services. Employee payment services utilization was 73% as of May 31, 2008 compared to 71% as of May 31, 2007, with over 80% of our new clients selecting these services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 19% to $471.8 million for fiscal 2008. The growth was generated primarily from the following: retirement services client base increased 9% to 48,000 clients; comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 18% to 439,000 client employees served; and workers' compensation insurance client base increased 17% to 72,000 clients. The asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 11% to $9.7 billion. In addition, revenue from health and benefits services and BeneTrac contributed to the increase in Human Resource Services revenue in fiscal 2008.
     Total expenses increased 4% to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2008, as a result of increases in personnel and other costs related to selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services. Excluding a $38.0 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve for the year ended May 31, 2007, expenses would have increased 8%.
 
     For fiscal 2008, our operating income was $828.3 million, an increase of 18% over the prior fiscal year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1) increased 15% to $696.5 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to $605.4 million for the prior fiscal year. As a percent of service revenues, operating income, net of certain items, improved to 36% for fiscal 2008 from 35% for the prior fiscal year.
     For fiscal 2008, interest on funds held for clients decreased 2% to $131.8 million due primarily to lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by higher realized gains and higher average investment balances. Investment income decreased 36% to $26.5 million primarily due to lower average investment balances, resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program commenced in August 2007.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008, compared with a net unrealized loss of $14.9 million as of May 31, 2007. During fiscal 2008, the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $24.3 million to a net unrealized gain of $48.7 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $6.3 million as of June 23, 2008.
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities, primarily with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We have no exposure to any sub-prime mortgage securities, auction rate securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and have never experienced a failed auction. Our variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") are rated A-1/P-1 and must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial institutions. Our current exposure to VRDN bond insurers is limited to Financial Security Assurance.

FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2008 HIGHLIGHTS
     The weakening economy and declining interest rates negatively impacted our total revenues for the three months ended May 31, 2008 (the "fourth quarter"). However, continued leveraging of our expenses allowed us to achieve solid profit results during this period. Below is a summary of our fourth quarter financial results:
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We estimate the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the Federal Funds rate at the present time would be approximately $4.5 million, after taxes, for the next twelve-month period. Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows:
     Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to approximate 13% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax rate is higher than for fiscal 2008 due to anticipated lower levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, to decrease by the following amounts in the respective quarters of fiscal 2009:
     Our stock repurchase program commenced in August 2007 and completed in December 2007 is expected to impact net income and diluted earnings per share growth for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, with diluted earnings per share growing at a higher rate than net income. Fiscal 2009 diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are expected to be comparable to the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

: In addition to reporting operating income, a generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in the year ended May 31, 2007 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs.
     Our Payroll services are provided through either our core payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:
 
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary services; leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.
     Fiscal 2008 was our eighteenth consecutive year of record total revenue, net income, and diluted earnings per share. It was also a milestone year for us as total revenue exceeded $2.0 billion for the first time. Our financial results for fiscal 2008 included the following highlights:
     In July 2007, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a 43% increase in our quarterly dividend payment to $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share. In August 2007, we commenced our program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of Paychex, Inc. common stock. We completed this program in December 2007, repurchasing a total of 23.7 million shares for $1.0 billion.
     Our financial performance for fiscal 2008 was largely due to service revenue growth of 10% over the prior fiscal year. This growth in service revenue was attributable to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in the utilization of our ancillary services. The weakening economy and declining interest rates negatively impacted our total revenues for fiscal 2008. However, continued leveraging of our expenses allowed us to achieve solid profit results during this fiscal year.
 
     Our financial performance was impacted by decreases in interest rates earned on our funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. The Federal Funds rate declined 325 basis points in fiscal 2008 to 2.00% as of May 31, 2008. Our combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, decreased 10% for fiscal 2008 as a result of these declining rates, as well as lower corporate invested balances due to funding of the stock repurchase program. The combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 3.7% for fiscal 2008, compared to 4.0% for fiscal 2007 and 3.2% for fiscal 2006. The impact of changing interest rates and related risks is discussed in more detail in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2008, we had no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments. Refer to the "Investment Portfolio Overview" section of this review for more information.
     In addition to reporting operating income, a generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the SEC. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 15% to $696.5 million for fiscal 2008 compared to $605.4 million for fiscal 2007 and $548.8 million for fiscal 2006.
     We continue to make investments in our business as part of our growth strategy. Some of these investments include the following:
       Our client base increased to approximately 572,000 clients as of May 31, 2008. This compares with approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31, 2007, and approximately 543,000 clients as of May 31, 2006. Client base growth was 2.0% for fiscal 2008, compared with 3.3% for fiscal 2007 and 4.0% for fiscal 2006. Net client growth in fiscal 2008 reflected weaker economic conditions including, among others, a reduced level of new business starts in the markets we serve and an approximately 11% increase in the number of clients who went out of business or no longer had any employees compared to fiscal 2007.
Growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services:
     Growth opportunities continue to exist in our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses, and accordingly we continue to increase the size of our various sales forces. The following table summarizes the expected composition of our sales force in the year ending May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009") with comparisons from fiscal 2007:
     We believe there are opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings:
 
       During fiscal 2008, we made investments to broaden our portfolio of services and products. This included expanding the services offered to our MMS clients to strengthen our software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll and human resource administrative needs of our clients. These enhancements include the following:
Service and product initiatives:
     In addition, other fiscal 2008 initiatives included the following:
       We may supplement our growth from time to time through strategic acquisitions when opportunities arise. In August 2007, we acquired Hawthorne Benefit Technologies, Inc. and its BeneTrac technology, a powerful web-based employee management and administrative system, previously mentioned as an enhancement to services for our MMS clients. We currently have no definitive agreements with respect to any material prospective acquisition.
Business acquisitions:
       We have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention. For fiscal 2008, client satisfaction results were at an all-time high and client retention was approximately 80% of our beginning of the year client base.
Focus on customer service:
       As of May 31, 2008, we maintained a strong financial position with cash and total corporate investments of $434.8 million. Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations increased 15% to $724.7 million for fiscal 2008. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2008, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Financial position:
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, and our financial position as of May 31, 2008, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this review.
Investment Portfolio Overview
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities, primarily with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We have no exposure to any sub-prime mortgage securities, auction rate securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
 
     We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and have never experienced a failed auction. Our variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") are rated A-1/P-1 and must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial institutions. Our current exposure to VRDN bond insurers is limited to Financial Security Assurance ("FSA").
     Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
Outlook
     Our current outlook for fiscal 2009 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We estimate the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the Federal Funds rate at the present time would be approximately $4.5 million, after taxes, for the next twelve-month period. Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows:
     Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to approximate 13% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax rate is higher than for fiscal 2008 due to anticipated lower levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, to decrease by the following amounts in the respective quarters of fiscal 2009:
     Our stock repurchase program commenced in August 2007 and completed in December 2007 is expected to impact net income and diluted earnings per share growth for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, with diluted earnings per share growing at a higher rate than net income. Fiscal 2009 diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are expected to be comparable to the diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the three months ended May 31, 2008.
     Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2009 are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Fiscal 2009 depreciation expense is projected to be approximately $68 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2009 to be approximately $20 million.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
       Payroll service revenue increased 8% for fiscal 2008 and 9% for fiscal 2007 to $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The increases in Payroll service revenue were primarily attributable to client base growth, higher check volume, price increases, and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services. In fiscal 2008, we have seen signs of a weakening economy, indicated by a more difficult than normal third quarter selling season and increases in clients going out of business or no longer having any employees.
Revenue:
     As of May 31, 2008, 93% of clients utilized our payroll tax administration services compared with 93% as of May 31, 2007 and 92% as of May 31, 2006. Our employee payment services were utilized by 73% of our clients as of May 31, 2008, compared with 71% as of May 31, 2007 and 68% as of May 31, 2006. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients select a form of our employee payment services.
 
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 19% for fiscal 2008 and 22% for fiscal 2007 to $471.8 million and $396.2 million, respectively. The following factors contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007:
     In addition, revenue from health and benefits services was $12.3 million, a 93% increase from fiscal 2007, and revenue from BeneTrac was $8.4 million in fiscal 2008.
     The decrease in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances and higher realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Interest on funds held for clients increased in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of higher average interest rates earned and higher average investment balances. The higher average investment balances in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were driven by client base growth, wage inflation, check volume growth within our current client base, and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services. See the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review for more information on changing interest rates.
       The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31:
Combined operating and SG&A expenses:
     During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters. Excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve, combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 8% for fiscal 2008 and 12% for fiscal 2007. This was primarily the result of increases in personnel and other costs related to selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services. Fiscal 2008 expense growth benefited from continued leveraging in response to weakening economic conditions. Fiscal 2007 was impacted by the recognition of $25.7 million of expense related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123 (revised 2004) ("SFAS No. 123R"), "Share-Based Payment." Fiscal 2007 growth rates were also impacted by comparison to higher than normal levels of sales expense for fiscal 2006 as our sales force exceeded its targets. As of May 31, 2008, we had approximately 12,200 employees compared with approximately 11,700 as of May 31, 2007 and 10,900 as of May 31, 2006.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to higher levels of capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. Amortization increased in fiscal 2008 as a result of intangibles from acquisitions during the fiscal year. Amortization increased in fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with New England Business Services, Inc. ("NEBS") and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
       Operating income growth was 18% for fiscal 2008 and 8% for fiscal 2007. The increases in operating income for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating income:
 
     Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve. Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the "Overview" section of this review. Operating income, net of certain items, is as follows for the year ended May 31:
     The growth in operating income, net of certain items, for fiscal 2007 was impacted by the adoption of SFAS No. 123R effective June 1, 2006, requiring recognition of $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs in fiscal 2007. No stock-based compensation costs were recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2006.
       Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The decrease in investment income for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to lower average investment balances, resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program. The increase in investment income for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 was mainly due to higher average interest rates earned and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations.
Investment income, net:
       Our effective income tax rate was 32.6% for fiscal 2008, compared with 30.7% for fiscal 2007, and 31.1% for fiscal 2006. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios, and a higher effective state income tax rate as a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." The decrease in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily the result of higher levels of tax-exempt income and a lower effective state income tax rate. For fiscal 2008 and 2007, the effective tax rate was impacted by non-deductible compensation related to incentive stock option grants.
Income taxes:
       Net income growth was 12% for fiscal 2008 and 11% for fiscal 2007 increasing to $576.1 million and $515.4 million, respectively. These increases were attributable to the factors previously discussed, including, in fiscal 2007, the increase to the litigation reserve of $38.0 million. Fiscal 2007 growth was also impacted by the $25.7 million of stock-based compensation costs due to the June 1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Diluted earnings per share increase 16% in fiscal 2008 to $1.56 per share and 11% in fiscal 2007 to $1.35 per share. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008 increased at a rate higher than net income growth due to a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program.
Net income and earnings per share:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     As of May 31, 2008, we had $434.8 million in cash and total corporate investments. Cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2008, along with projected operating cash flows, are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     We have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:
 
     Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2008 or as of May 31, 2008.
     As of May 31, 2008, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $71.5 million, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies and bonding requirements. These letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2008 and December 2012 and are secured by securities held in our investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2008 or as of May 31, 2008.
     We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2008. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2008:
     Advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was $15.3 million and $15.2 million, respectively.
 
     We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
     We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We have insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Reclassification within Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
     Client fund obligations represent our contractual obligation to remit funds to satisfy clients' payroll and tax payment obligations. We have reclassified the net change in client fund obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from investing activities to financing activities for all periods presented. This reclassification had no impact on the net change in cash and cash equivalents or cash flows from operating activities for any period presented.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to the expense charge of $38.0 million to increase the litigation reserve in fiscal 2007, offset by an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes. The increase in non-cash adjustment for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to the charge to increase the litigation reserve and $25.7 million in stock-based compensation costs due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to lower interest receivable balances in fiscal 2008 and the timing of collection and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
       Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
 
     Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. For fiscal 2008, the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investments also reflected the effects of the $1.0 billion stock repurchase program as funds used for this program were not invested in securities. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
       To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, we purchased approximately $4.4 million, $2.8 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board. Construction in progress totaled $52.1 million and $46.5 million as of May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of these costs, $51.6 million and $39.5 million represent software being developed for internal use as of May 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use, at which time we begin amortization of the costs. We expect amortization of a significant portion of the internal use software costs in construction in progress to begin in fiscal 2009, and to be amortized over fifteen years.
Purchases of long-lived assets:
     Other assets increased for fiscal 2008 due to purchases of customer lists. Other assets increased for fiscal 2007 mainly due to the termination of our client-servicing arrangement with NEBS and the purchasing of the right to service the related clients. During fiscal 2008, we paid $32.9 million related to acquisitions of businesses, compared with $3.1 million and $0.7 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days.
Net change in client fund obligations:
     During fiscal 2008, we completed our stock repurchase program, which commenced in August 2007, and repurchased 23.7 million shares for a total of $1.0 billion.
Repurchases of common stock:
     In July 2007, our Board approved an increase of 43% in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share. In October 2006, our Board approved an increase of 31% in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.21 per share from $0.16 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 77%, 58%, and 50% for fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
     The increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007, and for fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006, was primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal 2008 were 2.0 million shares compared with 1.8 million shares for fiscal 2007 and 1.7 million shares for fiscal 2006. We have recognized an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $9.1 million for fiscal 2008 and $9.7 million for fiscal 2007 that is reflected in cash flows from financing activities in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, as adopted on June 1, 2006. For fiscal 2006, we recognized tax benefits related to exercise of stock options of $11.6 million that are reflected in cash flows from operating activities.
Exercise of stock options:

     In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This statement clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") FAS 157-2, "Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157." This FSP delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 157, except for this deferral, in our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
New accounting pronouncements:
     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115." This statement allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value as a measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities with changes in fair value recognized in the results of operations. The statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 159 in our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. We do not expect this statement to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-11 ("EITF 06-11"), "Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards." EITF 06-11 applies to share-based payment arrangements, with dividend protection features, that entitle an employee to receive dividends or dividend equivalents on nonvested equity-based shares or units, when those dividends or dividend equivalents are charged to retained earnings and result in an income tax deduction for the employer under SFAS No. 123R. Under EITF 06-11, a realized income tax benefit from dividends or dividend equivalents charged to retained earnings and paid to an employee for nonvested equity-based shares or units should be recognized as an increase in additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 with early adoption permitted. EITF 06-11 was adopted on June 1, 2007 and did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     In June 2007, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") issued Statement of Position No. 07-1, "Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies" ("SOP 07-1"). SOP 07-1 clarifies when an entity may apply the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide and addresses the retention of specialized investment company accounting by a parent company in consolidation or by an equity method investor. SOP 07-1, as issued, was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007 and was applicable for our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2008. SOP 07-1 was indefinitely deferred by the FASB in February 2008.

     In December 2007, the FASB issued the following statements of financial accounting standards applicable to business combinations:
     SFAS No. 141R provides guidance on how an entity will recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired (including goodwill), liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests, if any, acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be treated as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. Both standards are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and are applicable to our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating both standards but do not expect their adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
 
     In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, "Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets." This guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141R, when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension. Companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or, in the absence of historical experience, must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for SFAS No. 142's entity-specific factors. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and is applicable to our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this FSP will have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition.
     In March 2008 and May 2008, respectively, the FASB issued the following statements of financial accounting standards, neither of which is anticipated to have any impact to our results of operations or financial position:
Critical Accounting Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
     Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.4 billion for fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
     Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
     In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
 
     Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
     We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
     In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $1,000,000 under the fiscal 2008 policy and $750,000 under the fiscal 2007 policy.
     We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers' compensation claims as of:
     Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. However, changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment.
      We have $433.3 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2008, resulting from acquisitions of businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. We perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
Goodwill and other intangible assets:
 
     We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
     We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
     We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. As of May 31, 2008, we had approximately $23.0 million of reserves for pending litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Contingent liabilities:
     Effective June 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires that all stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option life. We estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior.
Stock-based compensation costs:
     Under SFAS No. 123R, we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catch-up adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
     We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
     We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock-based awards. We also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax position as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 on June 1, 2007.

Market Risk Factors
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially effect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. In seeking to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with such activities, we generally direct investments towards high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     As of May 31, 2008, we had no exposure to any sub-prime mortgage securities, auction rate securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
     We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and have never experienced a failed auction. Our VRDNs are rated A-1/P-1 and must have a liquidity facility issued by highly rated financial institutions. Our current exposure to VRDN bond insurers is limited to FSA.
     Our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates. During fiscal 2008, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 3.7% compared with 4.0% for fiscal 2007 and 3.2% for fiscal 2006. The Federal Funds rate decreased 325 basis points in fiscal 2008 and was 2.00% as of May 31, 2008. This compares to an increase in the Federal Funds rate of 25 basis points in fiscal 2007 and 200 basis points in fiscal 2006. A lower Federal Funds rate impacts the average interest rate we earn on our portfolios. While interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long- and short-term interest rate changes as discussed below.
     During a falling interest rate environment, the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short-term investments, and over time will decrease earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2008 had an average duration of 2.7 years, excluding the impact of VRDNs tied to short-term interest rates, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates.
     The cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2008 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
     VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.
 
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:
     Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $4.1 billion for fiscal 2008. Our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately 55% invested in short-term securities and available-for-sale securities with an average duration of 35 days, and 45% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008, compared with a net unrealized loss of $14.9 million as of May 31, 2007. The change resulted from decreases in long-term market interest rates. During fiscal 2008, the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $24.3 million to a net unrealized gain of $48.7 million. During fiscal 2007, the net unrealized loss ranged from $29.5 million to $1.1 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $6.3 million as of June 23, 2008.
     As of May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, we had $3.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity was 3.4% and 3.7%, as of May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes available-for-sale securities tied to short-term interest rates such as auction securities and VRDNs. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available-for-sale securities as of May 31, 2008, would be approximately $12.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other-than-temporary.
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.

ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
The following exhibit relating to Item 5.02 of this Form 8-K is filed herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 10.1
     1. . This 2008-2009 Officer Performance Incentive Award Agreement (this "Award Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions of the Performance Award (the "Award") granted to you by the Governance and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") under the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated effective October 12, 2005 (the "Plan").

The capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement are defined in the Plan. In the event of any conflict among the provisions of the Plan and this Award Agreement, the provisions of the Plan will be controlling and determinative.
Grant of Award
     2. . The Total Target Value of the Award is set forth above and consists of three components: (a) the Revenue Component; (b) the Operating Income Component; and (c) the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Component.
Target Value and Components
     3. . Your rights to the Actual Value (as that term is defined below) under Section 5, shall be provisional and shall be canceled in whole or in part, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion if your continuous employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than death or Disability on or before the last day of the Performance Period. Whether and as of what date your employment with the Company shall terminate if you are granted a leave of absence or commence any other break in employment intended by your employer to be temporary, shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In the event of your death or Disability, you or your estate shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata payment of the Actual Value of the Award based on the ratio of the number of days from the beginning of the Performance Period through the date of your death or Disability and the total number of days in the Performance Period.
Requirement of Employment
 
     4. .
Determination of Value
          (a) . As soon as practicable after the last day of the Performance Period and prior to the payment of the Award, the Committee shall determine the Revenue Value as of the last day of the Performance Period, if any, as provided in Section 4(b), the Operating Income Value as of the last day of the Performance Period, if any, as provided in Section 4(c), and the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Value as of the last day of the Performance Period, if any, as provided in Section 4(d). The sum of the Revenue Value, Operating Income Value and the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Value shall be the Potential Value of the Award as so determined. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, then reduce, but not increase, the Potential Value to determine the Actual Value of the Award.
Potential Value and Actual Value
          (b) . The Revenue Value shall be your current annual base pay of $915,000 (the "Base Value"), multiplied by the Revenue Payment Percentage from Exhibit A, based on the Revenue for the Performance Period. "Revenue" for the Performance Period means Total Service Revenue for the Performance Period.
Revenue Value
          (c) . The Operating Income Value shall be the Base Value, multiplied by the Operating Income Payment Percentage from Exhibit A, based on the Operating Income for the Performance Period. "Operating Income" means Operating Income, less Interest on Funds Held for Clients, for the Performance Period.
Operating Income Value
          (d) . The Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Value shall be the Base Value, multiplied by the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Payment Percentage from Exhibit A, based on the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio for the Performance Period; provided, however, (i) the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Payment Percentage may not exceed the Threshold payment percentage unless the Revenue for the Performance Period meets or exceeds the Revenue Threshold set forth in the Revenue Payment Percentage table on Exhibit A, and (ii) the Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Payment Percentage may not exceed the Target payment percentage unless the Revenue for the Performance Period meets or exceeds the Revenue Target set forth in the Revenue Payment Percentage table on Exhibit A. "Operating Income to Revenue Ratio" for the Performance Period means (1) Operating Income, less Interest on Funds Held for Clients, for the Performance Period, over (2) Total Service Revenue for the Performance Period.
Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Value
          (e) . In determining the Potential Value of the Award, "Total Service Revenue," "Operating Income" and "Interest on Funds Held for Clients" for a specified period shall mean the total service revenue, operating income and interest on funds held for clients for such period, respectively, each as reported in the Company's annual audited financial statements for such period, but in each case excluding the following (each, an "Exclusion Item"): asset write-downs; litigation or claim judgments or settlements; changes in tax law, accounting principles or other such laws or provisions affecting reported results; severance, contract termination and other costs related to entering or exiting certain business activities; and gains or losses from the acquisition or disposition of businesses or assets or from the early extinguishment of debt, or other unusual items. In addition to its general authority to reduce the Potential Value, when determining the Actual Value of the Award, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, take into consideration the effect of the inclusion of one or more of the Exclusion
Calculation
 
Items, provided, however, that the Actual Value may not exceed the Potential Value as determined pursuant to this Section 4.
          (f) . The Committee's determination of the Revenue Value, Operating Income Value, Operating Income to Revenue Ratio Value, Potential Value and Actual Value pursuant to this Award Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and all persons claiming under or through you.
Committee's Determinations Final
     5. . The Actual Value, as determined pursuant to Section 4, if any, shall become payable to you in cash as promptly as practicable following the determination of such amount by the Committee, but in no event later than the March 15th of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Performance Period ends (the "Payment Date"). Any payment made in respect of the Award will be reduced by the amount of all taxes required by any governmental authority to be withheld and paid over by the Company or any Affiliate to the governmental authority on account of such payment.
Payment of Award
     6. .
Miscellaneous
          (a) . The Award is intended to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, and this Award Agreement shall be interpreted and the Award shall be administered consistent with such intention.
Qualified Performance-Based Compensation
          (b) . The Award is intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and this Award Agreement shall be interpreted and the Award shall be administered consistent with such intention.
Section 409A
          (c) . Except as otherwise provided by the Plan, the Company may only alter, amend or terminate the Award with your consent.
Amendment
          (d) . Neither the Plan, the granting of the Award nor this Award Agreement gives you any right to remain in the employment of the Company or any Affiliate.
No Right to Employment
          (e) . The Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered in any way prior to the payment thereof, whether by operation of law or otherwise.
Nontransferable
          (f) . This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except as superseded by applicable federal law, without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions.
Governing Law
 
If an actual performance level falls between two performance levels shown on the above grids, then the applicable payment percentage will be determined using straight-line interpolation.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Paychex, Inc.'s press release dated September 24, 2008, which reports its financial results for the three months ended August 31, 2008, is furnished as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01 EXHIBITS
The following exhibit relating to Item 2.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is furnished herewith:
     Exhibit 99.1      Press Release of Paychex, Inc. dated September 24, 2008.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
September 24, 2008
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 24, 2008  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $148.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008 (the "first quarter"), a 2% decrease from net income of $151.1 million for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.41, an increase of 3% over $0.40 per share for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share increased at a greater rate than the net income change due to a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program completed during the year ended May 31, 2008 ("fiscal 2008"). Total revenue was $534.1 million, a 5% increase over $507.1 million for the same period last year.
     "Despite ongoing, weak economic conditions, we were again pleased to generate record levels of revenue and earnings per share for the first quarter. We have been able to continue our practice of growing revenues at a faster rate than expenses," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of service revenues improved to 39% for the first quarter from 38% for the same period last year."
     Payroll service revenue increased 5% to $378.5 million for the first quarter from the same period last year due to client base growth, price increases, and growth in the utilization of ancillary services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 16% to $131.4 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. The growth was generated primarily from the following: comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 17% to 446,000 client employees served; workers' compensation insurance client base increased 15% to 74,000 clients; and retirement services client base increased 9% to 49,000 clients. The asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds increased 7% to $9.4 billion.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $221.6 million, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1) increased 11% to $197.4 million for the first quarter as compared to $178.3 million for the same period last year.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients decreased 25% to $24.2 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by higher average investment balances. Investment income decreased 75% to $3.0 million primarily due to lower average investment balances, resulting from the funding of the stock repurchase program commenced at the beginning of August 2007, and lower average interest rates earned.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     We maintain a conservative investment strategy within our portfolio of available-for-sale securities to maximize liquidity and protect principal. Our exposure has been limited in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.
     As of September 22, 2008, we have sold substantially all of our variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs"). The VDRNs are money market securities held at par. No losses have resulted from these sales. We expect to be fully divested of VRDNs by the end of September 2008. Funds from the VRDNs are being reinvested in agency discount notes. We have no auction rate securities in our investment portfolio. We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and have never experienced a failed auction. We have no exposure to any sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of September 22, 2008, we do not have any position in prime money market funds.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $34.4 million as of August 31, 2008, compared with a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $4.4 million to $34.8 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $19.6 million as of September 22, 2008.

OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We estimate the earnings effect of a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the Federal Funds rate at the present time would be approximately $4.5 million, after taxes, for the next twelve-month period.
     Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows:
     Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to approximate 11% to 13% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax rate is higher than fiscal 2008 due to lower levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, to (decrease)/increase by the following amounts in the remaining respective quarters of fiscal 2009:
: In addition to reporting operating income, a generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

All statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, including statements relating to revenue growth, earnings, earnings-per-share growth, or similar projections, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light of important risk factors. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following risks, as well as those that are described in our filings with the SEC: general market and economic conditions including, among others, changes in United States employment and wage levels, changes in new hiring trends, changes in short- and long-term interest rates, and changes in the fair value and the credit rating of securities held by us; changes in demand for our services and products, ability to develop and market new services and products effectively, pricing changes and the impact of competition, and the availability of skilled workers; changes in the laws regulating collection and payment of payroll taxes, professional employer organizations, and employee benefits, including retirement plans, workers' compensation, health insurance, state unemployment, and section 125 plans; changes in workers' compensation rates and underlying claims trends; the possibility of failure to keep pace with technological changes and provide timely enhancements to services and products; the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer systems, and communication systems during a catastrophic event; the possibility of third-party service providers failing to perform their functions; the possibility of penalties and losses resulting from errors and omissions in performing services; the possible inability of our clients to meet their payroll obligations; the possible failure of internal controls or our inability to implement business processing improvements; and potentially unfavorable outcomes related to pending legal matters. Any of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. The information provided in this document is based upon the facts and circumstances known at this time. We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements after the date of issuance of this release, to reflect events or circumstances after such date, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
On October 6, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Paychex, Inc. (the "Company") approved two new non-qualified deferred compensation plans, effective as of January 1, 2005. In January 2005, the Board had suspended any further contributions to the existing plans at the time. The Paychex, Inc. Employee Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2005, allows certain highly compensated and/or management employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and bonus. The Paychex, Inc. Board Deferred Compensation Plan, effective January 1, 2005, allows non-employee Directors to defer up to 100% of their Board compensation. The new plans incorporate provisions required by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
The following exhibits relating to Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K are furnished herewith:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 10.1
     1.01 . The purpose of the Plan is to provide certain members of management and highly compensated employees of the Company with an opportunity to elect to defer the receipt of a portion of their Eligible Compensation.
Purpose
     1.02 . The Plan was adopted by the Board effective as of January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date").
Effective Date
     For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the context, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated in this Article 2:
 
 
 
 
     3.01 . For each Plan Year, the Committee may select, in its sole discretion, the Employees who shall be eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to that Plan Year. The Committee's selection of an Employee to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year will not entitle that Employee to make a Deferral Election with respect to any subsequent Plan Year, unless the Employee is again selected by the Committee to make a Deferral Election with respect to such subsequent Plan Year.
Selection by Committee
     3.02 . As a condition to being eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to a Plan Year, each selected Employee shall complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form at the time, and in accordance with the terms and conditions, that the Committee may establish from time to time, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. The Committee may in its discretion permit a Newly Eligible Employee to complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form no later than 30 days following the date on which such Employee first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, or such earlier date as the Committee may establish from time to time.
Enrollment Requirements
     3.03 . Provided an Employee selected to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year has met all enrollment requirements set forth in the Plan and any other requirements imposed by the Committee, including submitting an Annual Election Form within the specified time period, the Employee's designated deferrals shall commence as of the first day of the particular Plan Year. In the case of a Newly Eligible Employee, the Newly Eligible Employee's designated deferrals shall commence as of the date such Newly Eligible Employee's Annual Enrollment Form is received by the Committee, but no later than 30 days following the date on which such Employee first became eligible to participate in the Plan, and such Deferral Election shall apply only with respect to the Eligible Compensation earned for services performed subsequent to the time such Annual Election Form is received by the Committee. If an Employee fails to meet all such requirements within the specified time period with respect to any Plan Year, the Employee shall not be eligible to make a Deferral Election for that Plan Year.
Commencement of Participation
     3.04 . The Annual Election Form submitted by a Participant in respect of a particular Plan Year will remain effective with respect to and apply to each subsequent Plan Year unless: (a) the Participant is not an Employee selected to participate in the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year; (b) the Participant files a new Annual Election Form
Subsequent Plan Year Elections
 
for such subsequent Plan Year; (c) the Participant revokes his or her prior Annual Election Form in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee for such action; or (d) the Employee's Deferral Election is suspended pursuant to Section 4.01(d) in the immediately preceding Plan Year.
     4.01 .
Participant Deferrals
          (a) . The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine in respect of each Plan Year: (i) whether an Employee shall be allowed to participate in the Plan with respect to such Plan Year; (ii) the items of Eligible Compensation which may be deferred with respect to that Plan Year; and (iii) any other terms and conditions applicable to the Deferral Elections for that Plan Year. A Participant's Deferral Election shall be evidenced by an Annual Election Form completed and submitted to the Committee in accordance with the procedures and time frames as may be established by the Committee in its sole discretion. The amounts deferred by a Participant in respect of services rendered during a Plan Year shall be referred to collectively as an Annual Participant Deferral and shall be credited to an Account established in the name of the Participant. Each Participant shall have one Account under the Plan.
Deferral Election
          (b) . The Committee may from time to time designate in the Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year a minimum or maximum deferral amount or percentage, either in the aggregate or per item of Eligible Compensation, applicable with respect to that Plan Year.
Minimum and Maximum Deferrals
          (c) . A Participant may designate the amount of the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from his or her Eligible Compensation as specified in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year, which may provide for deferrals to be expressed as either a percentage or a fixed dollar amount of a specified item of Eligible Compensation expected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee. If a Participant designates the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from any item of Eligible Compensation as a fixed dollar amount and such fixed dollar amount exceeds the amount of such item of Eligible Compensation actually payable to the Participant, the entire amount of such item of Eligible Compensation shall be withheld.
Deferral Designations
          (d) . Except as otherwise provided by Section 3.04, this Section 4.01(d) or elsewhere in the Plan, once made, a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year shall become irrevocable with respect to that Plan Year as of the deadline for Deferral Elections for that Plan Year, as set forth in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials.
Suspension of Deferral Elections
                (i) From and after the date that a Participant is deemed to have suffered a Disability, any standing Deferral Election of the Participant shall automatically be cancelled and no further deferrals shall be made with respect to the Participant.
 
                (ii) If a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency or a hardship distribution pursuant to Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) of the treasury regulations (or any successor thereto), the Participant may petition the Committee to cancel his or her Deferral Election. A petition shall be made on the written form required by the Committee to be used for such request and shall include all information requested by the Committee in order to make a determination on such petition, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether to approve the Participant's petition. If the petition for a cancellation is approved, cancellation shall take effect upon the date of approval, and such Deferral Election must be cancelled and not merely postponed or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have any right to approve a request for cancellation of a Deferral Election if such approval (or right to approve) would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to a tax under, Section 409A.
                (iii) If a Participant's Deferral Election has been cancelled during a Plan Year pursuant to this Section 4.01(d), the Participant will not be eligible to make any further deferrals in respect of that Plan Year. The Participant may be eligible to make deferrals for a subsequent Plan Year provided the Participant is an Employee selected to make deferrals for such subsequent Plan Year and the Participant complies with the election requirements under the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year.
          (e) . If a Participant is authorized by the Company for any reason to take a paid leave of absence, so long as the Participant has not had a Separation from Service, the Participant shall continue to be considered employed by the Company and the appropriate amounts shall continue to be withheld from the Participant's compensation pursuant to the Participant's then current Deferral Election.
Paid Leave of Absence
          (f) . If a Participant is authorized by the Company for any reason to take an unpaid leave of absence, so long as the Participant has not had a Separation from Service, the Participant shall continue to be considered employed by the Company and, to the extent permitted by Section 409A, the Participant shall be excused from making deferrals until the earlier of the date the leave of absence expires or the Participant returns to a paid employment status. Upon such expiration or return, deferrals shall resume for the remaining portion of the Plan Year in which the expiration or return occurs, based on the Deferral Election, if any, made for that Plan Year. If no election was made for that Plan Year, no deferral shall be withheld.
Unpaid Leave of Absence
     4.02 . A Participant shall be vested in all amounts credited to his or her Account as of the date such amounts are credited to such Participant's Account.
Vesting
     4.03 .
FICA and Other Taxes
          (a) . For each Plan Year in which an Annual Participant Deferral is being withheld from a Participant, the Company shall withhold from the other compensation payable by the Company to the Participant, in a manner determined by the Company, the Participant's share of FICA and other employment taxes on such amounts. If the Committee determines that such portion may not be sufficient to cover the amount of the applicable withholding, then the Committee may reduce the Annual Participant Deferral to the extent necessary, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, for the Company to comply with applicable withholding requirements.
Annual Deferral Amounts
 
          (b) . The Company shall withhold from any payments made to a Participant under the Plan all federal, state and local income, employment and other taxes required to be withheld by the Company, in connection with such payments, in amounts and in a manner to be determined in the sole discretion of the Company.
Distributions
     5.01 . The Committee shall establish from time to time the Designated Funds that will be available under the Plan. At any time, the Committee may, in its discretion, add one or more additional Designated Funds under the Plan, and in connection with any such addition, may permit Participants to select from among the then-available Designated Funds under the Plan to measure the value of such Participants' Accounts. In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may discontinue any Designated Fund at any time, and provide for the portions of Participants' Accounts and future deferrals designated to the discontinued Designated Fund to be reallocated to another Designated Fund.
Designated Funds
     5.02 .
Investment Directions
          (a) Subject to such limitations, operating rules and procedures as may from time to time be required by law, imposed by the Committee, contained elsewhere in the Plan or set forth in any Annual Enrollment Materials, each Participant may communicate to the Investment Agent a direction (in accordance with this Article 5) as to how his or her Account should be deemed to be invested among the Designated Funds made available by the Committee. The Participant's investment directions shall designate the percentage (in any whole percent multiples, which must total 100%) of the portion of the subsequent contributions to the Participant's Account which is requested to be deemed to be invested in such Designated Funds, and shall be subject to the rules set forth below. The Investment Agent shall invest the assets of the Participant's Account in accordance with the directions of the Participant except to the extent that the Committee directs it to the contrary. The Committee has the authority, but not the requirement, in its sole and absolute discretion, to direct that a Participant's Account be invested among such investments as it deems appropriate and advisable, which investments need not be the same for each Participant.
          (b) Any initial or subsequent investment direction shall be in writing to the Investment Agent on a form supplied by the Investment Agent, or, as permitted by the Investment Agent, may be by oral designation or electronic transmission designation to the Investment Agent. A designation shall be effective as of the Designation Date next following the date the direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the Committee's right to override such direction. The Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, make an investment direction to the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account balance as of a Designation Date and a separate investment direction to the Investment Agent for contribution credits to his or her Account occurring after the Designation Date.
          (c) All amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall be deemed invested in accordance with the then effective investment direction, unless the Committee directs
 
otherwise. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
          (d) If a Participant files an investment direction with the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account as of a Designation Date which is received and accepted by the Investment Agent and not overridden by the Committee, then the Participant's existing Account shall be deemed to be reallocated as of the next Designation Date (or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable) among the designated investment funds according to the percentages specified in such investment direction. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
          (e) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may place limits on a Participant's ability to make changes with respect to any Designated Funds.
          (f) If the Investment Agent receives an initial or subsequent investment direction with respect to an Account which it deems to be incomplete, unclear or improper, or which is unacceptable for some other reason (determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Investment Agent), the Participant's investment direction for such Account then in effect shall remain in effect (or, in the case of a deficiency in an initial investment direction, the Participant shall be deemed to have filed no investment direction) until the Participant files an investment direction for such Account acceptable to the Investment Agent.
          (g) If the Investment Agent does not possess valid investment directions covering the full balance of a Participant's Account or subsequent contributions thereto (including, without limitation, situations in which no investment direction has been filed, situations in which the investment direction is not acceptable to the Investment Agent under Section 5.02(f), or situations in which some or all of the Participant's designated investments are no longer permissible Designated Funds), the Participant shall be deemed to have directed that the undesignated portion of the Account be invested in a money-market fund or similar short-term investment fund; , , the Committee may provide for the undesignated portion to be allocated to or among the Designated Fund(s) that the Participant did designate in the same proportion as the designated portion, or may provide for any other allocation method it deems appropriate, in its discretion.
provided
however
     5.03 . While a Participant's Account does not represent the Participant's ownership of, or any ownership interest in, any particular assets, the Participant's Account shall be adjusted in accordance with the Designated Fund(s), subject to the conditions and procedures set forth herein or established by the Committee from time to time. Any notional cash earnings generated under a Designated Fund (such as interest and cash dividends and distributions) shall, at the Committee's sole discretion, either be deemed to be reinvested in that Designated Fund or reinvested in one or more other Designated Fund(s) designated by the Committee. All notional acquisitions and dispositions of Designated Funds under a Participant's Account shall be deemed to occur at such times as the Committee shall determine to be administratively feasible in its sole discretion and the Participant's Account shall be adjusted accordingly. In addition, a Participant's Account may be adjusted from time to time, in
Adjustment of Accounts
 
accordance with procedures and practices established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect any notional transactional costs and other fees and expenses relating to the deemed investment, disposition or carrying of any Designated Fund for the Participant's Account. Adjustments made in accordance herewith shall be referred to as Investment Adjustments.
     5.04 . None of the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, shall have any liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation in the Plan, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the investment of a Participant's Account. The Investment Agent shall have no liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation hereunder, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Investment Agent, and its agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the investment of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction.

Distribution Elections
          (a) . The Participant shall make a Distribution Election at the time he or she first makes a Deferral Election to have the Participant's Account distributed in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, in each case commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, (i) on a specified date; or (ii) upon the Participant's Separation from Service.
Initial Election
          (b) . Subject to any restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee, a Participant may amend his or her Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account once by completing and submitting to the Committee within such time frame as the Committee may designate, an Amended Distribution Election Form; , , that such Amended Distribution Election Form election (i) is not made less than 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment (in the case of a Distribution Election for payment on a specified date or pursuant to a fixed schedule), (ii) does not take effect until 12 months after the date on which such election is made, and (iii) specifies that the payment with respect to which such election is made be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made (in the case of a Distribution Election related to payment other than in the event of death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency). For purposes of this Section 6.01(b), an election to receive the distribution of an Account in a series of installment payments commencing on the payment date shall be treated as an election to receive the payment as a single lump-sum payment on the initial payment date.
Subsequent Election
provided
however
 
     6.02 . If a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid in on a specified date, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, on such specified date, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment on Specified Date
     6.03 . Subject to Section 6.06, if a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid upon the Participant's Separation from Service, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, upon the Participant's Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment upon Separation from Service
     6.04 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, if a Participant dies before he or she has received a complete distribution of his or her Account Balance, the Participant's Account Balance shall be payable in accordance with the terms of Section 7.01 in a lump sum within 90 days of the date on which the Committee is notified in writing of the Participant's death, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but no later than the December 31st of the year of death, or if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date of death.
Payment upon Death of Participant
     6.05 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, but subject to Section 6.06, in the event of a Change in Control of Paychex, if such Change of Control constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of Paychex, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Paychex, each with the meaning given such terms by Section 409A, then: (a) the Plan shall be terminated upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, to the extent permissible under and in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A; and (b) the Account Balance of each Participant's Account will be paid out in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
Payment upon Change in Control of Paychex
     6.06 . Notwithstanding the terms of Section 6.03 and Section 6.05, if a Participant experiences a Separation from Service and the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of Separation from Service, and the payment of the Participant's Account is required to be delayed by six months pursuant to Section 409A, then the payment of the Participant's Account Balance shall be made or commence no earlier than the six-month anniversary of the Participant's Separation from Service.
Six-Month Delay for Specified Employees
 
     6.07 . In the event that a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to receive a partial or full payout of the Account Balance of the Participant's Account. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether the requested payout shall be made, and the amount of the payout; provided, however, that the payout shall not exceed the amount reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution. In making its determination under this Section 6.07, the Committee shall be guided by the requirements of Section 409A, and the Committee shall take into account the extent to which a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by the liquidation by the Participant of his or her assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). If, subject to the sole discretion of the Committee, the petition for a payout is approved, the payout shall be made within 30 days of the date of approval, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
Withdrawal in the Event of an Unforeseeable Emergency
     6.08 . Distributions under the Plan shall be paid in cash.
Form of Payment
     7.01 .
Designation of Beneficiaries
     (a) Each Participant may designate from time to time any person or persons (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive such benefits as may be payable under the Plan upon or after the Participant's death, and such designation may be changed from time to time by the Participant by filing a new designation. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant under the Plan once filed with the Committee, shall be made on a form provided by the Committee for such purpose, and will be effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.
     (b) In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, or if, at the time any benefit payment is due to a Beneficiary, there is no living Beneficiary validly named by the Participant, the Committee shall direct distribution of any such benefit payment to the Participant's spouse, if then living, but otherwise to the Participant's then living descendants, if any, per stirpes, but, if none, to the Participant's estate. In determining the existence or identity of anyone entitled to a benefit payment, the Committee may rely conclusively upon information supplied by the Participant's personal representative, executor or administrator. If a question arises as to the existence or identity of anyone entitled to receive a benefit payment as aforesaid, or if a dispute arises with respect to any such payment, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may direct the distribution of such payment to the Participant's estate without liability for any tax or other consequences which might flow therefrom, or may take such other action as it deems to be appropriate.
     7.02 . Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a Participant or to a Beneficiary at his or her last post office address as shown on the Company's records shall
Information to Be Furnished By Participants and Beneficiaries; Inability to Locate Participants or Beneficiaries
 
be binding on the Participant or Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall not be obliged to search for any Participant or Beneficiary beyond the sending of a registered letter to such last known address. If the Committee sends notice in this fashion to any Participant or Beneficiary that he or she is entitled to an amount under the Plan and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim such amount or make his or her location known to the Committee within three years thereafter, then, except as otherwise required by law, the Committee may, in complete satisfaction of any claim by or through such Participant or Beneficiary, direct distribution as if the Participant or Beneficiary had died or, if the Committee cannot locate the person or persons who is the proper payee in the event of the Participant's or Beneficiary's death, may direct that the amount payable shall be deemed to be a forfeiture.
     8.01 . The Company may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part by the actions of the Committee; , , that (a) no amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a Participant's Account Balance in existence at the time the amendment or modification is made, calculated as if the Participant had experienced a Separation from Service as of the effective date of the amendment or modification, and (b) no amendment or modification may be made if such amendment or modification would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to tax under, the provisions of Section 409A.
Amendment
provided
however
     8.02 . Although the Company may anticipate that it will continue the Plan for an indefinite period of time, there is no guarantee that the Company will continue the Plan or will not terminate the Plan at any time in the future. Accordingly, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board reserves the right to discontinue its sponsorship of the Plan and to terminate the Plan. In addition, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board may at any time terminate an Affiliate's participation in the Plan.
Termination
     9.01 . This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Members of the Committee may be Participants under the Plan. The Committee shall also have the discretion and authority to (a) make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and (b) decide or resolve any and all questions including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan. Any individual serving on the Committee who is a Participant shall not vote or act on any matter relating solely to himself or herself. When making a determination or calculation, the Committee shall be entitled to rely on information furnished by a Participant or the Company. The decision or action of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
Committee Duties
 
     9.02 . In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed representative) and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company.
Agents
     10.01 . The Committee shall establish procedures for reviewing claims for benefits under the Plan. Such procedures shall be administered so as to comply with regulations issued by the Department of Labor to the extent that such regulations are applicable to the particular claim at issue. Any Participant, Beneficiary or the estate of a deceased Participant (a "Claimant") shall have the right to be represented by another person in connection with his or her benefit claim, provided that the Committee is provided with satisfactory evidence that the representative has been authorized to act on behalf of the Claimant. The Committee and its authorized designees have the authority and discretion to administer and interpret the Plan and to decide claims for benefits, and their decisions are binding on all parties to the maximum extent permitted by law.
Establishment of Claims Procedures
     10.02 . A Claimant shall present the claim, in writing, to the Committee, and the Committee shall respond in writing. If the claim is denied, the written notice of denial shall, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: (i) state the specific reason or reasons for the denial, with specific references to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based; (ii) describe any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his or her claim and explain why such material or information is necessary; (iii) explain the Plan's claims review procedure; and (iv) state that the Claimant has a right to file suit under Section 502(a) of ERISA if the claim is denied on appeal.
Presentation of Claim
     10.03 . The written notice denying or granting the Claimant's claim shall be provided to the Claimant within 90 days after the Committee's receipt of the claim, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. If such an extension is required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished by the Committee to the Claimant within the initial 90-day period and in no event shall such an extension exceed a period of 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period. Any extension notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date on which the Committee expects to render a decision on the claim.
Notification of Decision
     10.04 . Any Claimant whose claim is denied and who wishes to appeal must, within 60 days after the Claimant's receipt of notice of the denial, request a review of the denial by notice given, in writing, to the Committee. Upon such a request for review, the claim shall be given a full and fair review by the Committee, which may, but shall not be required to, grant the Claimant a hearing. In connection with the review, the Claimant may have representation, may examine and receive copies (free of charge) of pertinent documents upon request, and may submit issues and comments in writing. The Committee shall consider all information and arguments presented, regardless of whether they were included in the initial claim.
Review of a Denied Claim
 
     10.05 . The decision on review normally shall be made and communicated to the Claimant in writing within 60 days of the Committee's receipt of the request for review. If an extension of time is required due to special circumstances, the Claimant shall be notified, in writing, by the Committee, and the time limit for the decision on review shall be extended to up to 120 days. The written decision on review shall, in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: (i) state the reasons for the decision; (ii) cite pertinent Plan provisions; (iii) inform the Claimant that he or she is entitled, upon request and free of charge, reasonably to review and receive copies of relevant documents, and (iv) inform the Claimant of his or her right to bring suit under Section 502(a) of ERISA now that his or her claim has been denied on appeal.
Decision on Review
     11.01 . The Plan is intended to be (a) a plan that is not qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and (b) a plan that "is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1). The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
Status of Plan
     11.02 . It is intended that the Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with provisions of Section 409A, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any benefits accrued hereunder in a taxable year prior to the taxable year or years in which such amount would otherwise be actually distributed or made available to the Participants. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
Section 409A
     11.03 . Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in any property or assets of the Company. For purposes of the payment of benefits under the Plan, any and all of the Company's assets, shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor
     11.04 . Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure, attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency or be transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.
Nonassignability
     11.05 . The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between the Company and the Participant. Such
Not a Contract of Employment
 
employment is hereby acknowledged to be an "at will" employment relationship that can be terminated at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice, except as otherwise provided in a written employment agreement. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company as an employee or to interfere with the right of the Company to discipline or discharge the Participant at any time.
     11.06 . Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the singular or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.
Terms
     11.07 . The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.
Captions
     11.08 . Subject to ERISA, the provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
Governing Law
     11.09 . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the address below:
Notice

Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark or the receipt for registration or certification.
     Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the Participant.
     11.10 . The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns.
Successors
     11.11 . In case any provision of the Plan shall be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.
Validity

EXHIBIT 10.2
     1.01 . The purpose of the Plan is to provide non-employee directors of the Company with an opportunity to elect to defer the receipt of a portion of their Eligible Compensation.
Purpose
     1.02 . The Plan was adopted by the Board effective as of January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date").
Effective Date
     For purposes of the Plan, unless otherwise clearly apparent from the context, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated in this Article 2:
 
 
 
     3.01 . For each Plan Year, the Committee may select, in its sole discretion, the Directors who shall be eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to that Plan Year. The Committee's selection of a Director to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year will not entitle that Director to make a Deferral Election with respect to any subsequent Plan Year, unless the Director is again selected by the Committee to make a Deferral Election with respect to such subsequent Plan Year.
Selection by Committee
     3.02 . As a condition to being eligible to make a Deferral Election with respect to a Plan Year, each selected Director shall complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form at the time, and in accordance with the terms and conditions, that the Committee may establish from time to time, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A. The Committee may in its discretion permit a Newly Eligible Director to complete and return to the Committee an Annual Election Form no later than 30 days following the date on which such Director first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan, or such earlier date as the Committee may establish from time to time.
Enrollment Requirements
 
     3.03 . Provided a Director selected to make a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year has met all enrollment requirements set forth in the Plan and any other requirements imposed by the Committee, including submitting an Annual Election Form within the specified time period, the Director's designated deferrals shall commence as of the first day of the particular Plan Year. In the case of a Newly Eligible Director, the Newly Eligible Director's designated deferrals shall commence as of the date such Newly Eligible Director's Annual Enrollment Form is received by the Committee, but no later than 30 days following the date on which such Director first became eligible to participate in the Plan, and such Deferral Election shall apply only with respect to the Eligible Compensation earned for services performed subsequent to the time such Annual Election Form is received by the Committee. If a Director fails to meet all such requirements within the specified time period with respect to any Plan Year, the Director shall not be eligible to make a Deferral Election for that Plan Year.
Commencement of Participation
     3.04 . The Annual Election Form submitted by a Participant in respect of a particular Plan Year will remain effective with respect to and apply to each subsequent Plan Year unless: (a) the Participant is not a Director selected to participate in the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year; (b) the Participant files a new Annual Election Form for such subsequent Plan Year; (c) the Participant revokes his or her prior Annual Election Form in accordance with the procedures established by the Committee for such action; or (d) the Director's Deferral Election is suspended pursuant to Section 4.01(d) in the immediately preceding Plan Year.
Subsequent Plan Year Elections
     4.01 .
Participant Deferrals
          (a) . The Committee shall have sole discretion to determine in respect of each Plan Year: (i) whether a Director shall be allowed to participate in the Plan with respect to such Plan Year; (ii) the items of Eligible Compensation which may be deferred with respect to that Plan Year; and (iii) any other terms and conditions applicable to the Deferral Elections for that Plan Year. A Participant's Deferral Election shall be evidenced by an Annual Election Form completed and submitted to the Committee in accordance with the procedures and time frames as may be established by the Committee in its sole discretion. The amounts deferred by a Participant in respect of services rendered during a Plan Year shall be referred to collectively as an Annual Participant Deferral and shall be credited to an Account established in the name of the Participant. Each Participant shall have one Account under the Plan.
Deferral Election
          (b) . The Committee may from time to time designate in the Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year a minimum or maximum deferral amount or percentage, either in the aggregate or per item of Eligible Compensation, applicable with respect to that Plan Year.
Minimum and Maximum Deferrals
          (c) . A Participant may designate the amount of the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from his or her Eligible Compensation as specified in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials for a given Plan Year, which may provide for
Deferral Designations
 
deferrals to be expressed as either a percentage or a fixed dollar amount of a specified item of Eligible Compensation expected by the Participant, as determined by the Committee. If a Participant designates the Annual Participant Deferral to be deducted from any item of Eligible Compensation as a fixed dollar amount and such fixed dollar amount exceeds the amount of such item of Eligible Compensation actually payable to the Participant, the entire amount of such item of Eligible Compensation shall be withheld.
          (d) . Except as otherwise provided by Section 3.04, this Section 4.01(d) or elsewhere in the Plan, once made, a Deferral Election with respect to a particular Plan Year shall become irrevocable with respect to that Plan Year as of the deadline for Deferral Elections for that Plan Year, as set forth in the applicable Annual Enrollment Materials.
Suspension of Deferral Elections
               (i) From and after the date that a Participant is deemed to have suffered a Disability, any standing Deferral Election of the Participant shall automatically be cancelled and no further deferrals shall be made with respect to the Participant.
               (ii) If a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to cancel his or her Deferral Election. A petition shall be made on the written form required by the Committee to be used for such request and shall include all information requested by the Committee in order to make a determination on such petition, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether to approve the Participant's petition. If the petition for a cancellation is approved, cancellation shall take effect upon the date of approval, and such Deferral Election must be cancelled and not merely postponed or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not have any right to approve a request for cancellation of a Deferral Election if such approval (or right to approve) would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to a tax under, Section 409A.
               (iii) If a Participant's Deferral Election has been cancelled during a Plan Year pursuant to this Section 4.01(d), the Participant will not be eligible to make any further deferrals in respect of that Plan Year. The Participant may be eligible to make deferrals for a subsequent Plan Year provided the Participant is a Director selected to make deferrals for such subsequent Plan Year and the Participant complies with the election requirements under the Plan for such subsequent Plan Year.
     4.02 . A Participant shall be vested in all amounts credited to his or her Account as of the date such amounts are credited to such Participant's Account.
Vesting
     5.01 . The Committee shall establish from time to time the Designated Funds that will be available under the Plan. At any time, the Committee may, in its discretion, add one or more additional Designated Funds under the Plan, and in connection with any such addition, may permit Participants to select from among the then-available Designated Funds under the Plan to measure the value of such Participants' Accounts. In addition, the
Designated Funds
 
Committee, in its sole discretion, may discontinue any Designated Fund at any time, and provide for the portions of Participants' Accounts and future deferrals designated to the discontinued Designated Fund to be reallocated to another Designated Fund.
     5.02 .
Investment Directions
          (a) Subject to such limitations, operating rules and procedures as may from time to time be required by law, imposed by the Committee, contained elsewhere in the Plan or set forth in any Annual Enrollment Materials, each Participant may communicate to the Investment Agent a direction (in accordance with this Article 5) as to how his or her Account should be deemed to be invested among the Designated Funds made available by the Committee. The Participant's investment directions shall designate the percentage (in any whole percent multiples, which must total 100%) of the portion of the subsequent contributions to the Participant's Account which is requested to be deemed to be invested in such Designated Funds, and shall be subject to the rules set forth below. The Investment Agent shall invest the assets of the Participant's Account in accordance with the directions of the Participant except to the extent that the Committee directs it to the contrary. The Committee has the authority, but not the requirement, in its sole and absolute discretion, to direct that a Participant's Account be invested among such investments as it deems appropriate and advisable, which investments need not be the same for each Participant.
          (b) Any initial or subsequent investment direction shall be in writing to the Investment Agent on a form supplied by the Investment Agent, or, as permitted by the Investment Agent, may be by oral designation or electronic transmission designation to the Investment Agent. A designation shall be effective as of the Designation Date next following the date the direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the Committee's right to override such direction. The Participant may, if permitted by the Committee, make an investment direction to the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account balance as of a Designation Date and a separate investment direction to the Investment Agent for contribution credits to his or her Account occurring after the Designation Date.
          (c) All amounts credited to a Participant's Account shall be deemed invested in accordance with the then effective investment direction, unless the Committee directs otherwise. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
          (d) If a Participant files an investment direction with the Investment Agent for his or her existing Account as of a Designation Date which is received and accepted by the Investment Agent and not overridden by the Committee, then the Participant's existing Account shall be deemed to be reallocated as of the next Designation Date (or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable) among the designated investment funds according to the percentages specified in such investment direction. Unless otherwise changed by the Committee, an investment direction shall remain in effect until the Participant's Account is distributed or until a subsequent investment direction is received and accepted by the Investment Agent.
 
          (e) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may place limits on a Participant's ability to make changes with respect to any Designated Funds.
          (f) If the Investment Agent receives an initial or subsequent investment direction with respect to an Account which it deems to be incomplete, unclear or improper, or which is unacceptable for some other reason (determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Investment Agent), the Participant's investment direction for such Account then in effect shall remain in effect (or, in the case of a deficiency in an initial investment direction, the Participant shall be deemed to have filed no investment direction) until the Participant files an investment direction for such Account acceptable to the Investment Agent.
          (g) If the Investment Agent does not possess valid investment directions covering the full balance of a Participant's Account or subsequent contributions thereto (including, without limitation, situations in which no investment direction has been filed, situations in which the investment direction is not acceptable to the Investment Agent under Section 5.02(f), or situations in which some or all of the Participant's designated investments are no longer permissible Designated Funds), the Participant shall be deemed to have directed that the undesignated portion of the Account be invested in a money-market fund or similar short-term investment fund; , , the Committee may provide for the undesignated portion to be allocated to or among the Designated Fund(s) that the Participant did designate in the same proportion as the designated portion, or may provide for any other allocation method it deems appropriate, in its discretion.
provided
however
     5.03 . While a Participant's Account does not represent the Participant's ownership of, or any ownership interest in, any particular assets, the Participant's Account shall be adjusted in accordance with the Designated Fund(s), subject to the conditions and procedures set forth herein or established by the Committee from time to time. Any notional cash earnings generated under a Designated Fund (such as interest and cash dividends and distributions) shall, at the Committee's sole discretion, either be deemed to be reinvested in that Designated Fund or reinvested in one or more other Designated Fund(s) designated by the Committee. All notional acquisitions and dispositions of Designated Funds under a Participant's Account shall be deemed to occur at such times as the Committee shall determine to be administratively feasible in its sole discretion and the Participant's Account shall be adjusted accordingly. In addition, a Participant's Account may be adjusted from time to time, in accordance with procedures and practices established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect any notional transactional costs and other fees and expenses relating to the deemed investment, disposition or carrying of any Designated Fund for the Participant's Account. Adjustments made in accordance herewith shall be referred to as Investment Adjustments.
Adjustment of Accounts
     5.04 . None of the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, shall have any liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation in the Plan, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors and employees (including, without limitation, each member of the Committee), and their designated agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the
No Investment Liability; Indemnification
 
investment of a Participant's Account. The Investment Agent shall have no liability whatsoever for the investment of a Participant's Account, or for the investment performance of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction. Each Participant hereunder, as a condition to his or her participation hereunder, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Investment Agent, and its agents and representatives, from any losses or damages of any kind (including, without limitation, lost opportunity costs) relating to the investment of a Participant's Account, other than as a result of the failure to follow a valid and effective investment direction.
     6.01 .
Distribution Elections
          (a) . The Participant shall make a Distribution Election at the time he or she first makes a Deferral Election to have the Participant's Account distributed in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, in each case commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, (i) on a specified date; or (ii) upon the Participant's Separation from Service.
Initial Election
          (b) . Subject to any restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee, a Participant may amend his or her Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account once by completing and submitting to the Committee within such time frame as the Committee may designate, an Amended Distribution Election Form; , , that such Amended Distribution Election Form election (i) is not made less than 12 months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment (in the case of a Distribution Election for payment on a specified date or pursuant to a fixed schedule), (ii) does not take effect until 12 months after the date on which such election is made, and (iii) specifies that the payment with respect to which such election is made be deferred for a period of not less than five years from the date such payment would otherwise have been made (in the case of a Distribution Election related to payment other than in the event of death, Disability or Unforeseeable Emergency). For purposes of this Section 6.01(b), an election to receive the distribution of an Account in a series of installment payments commencing on the payment date shall be treated as an election to receive the payment as a single lump-sum payment on the initial payment date.
Subsequent Election
provided
however
     6.02 . If a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid in on a specified date, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, on such specified date, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment on Specified Date
 
     6.03 . If a Participant made a Distribution Election with respect to his or her Account to have such Account paid upon the Participant's Separation from Service, then the Account Balance of the Participant's Account will be paid out in either a lump sum, or two to ten substantially equivalent annual installments, as specified by the Participant in his or her Distribution Election, commencing, in accordance with administrative guidelines determined by the Committee, upon the Participant's Separation from Service, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days. If such a Participant dies or there is a Change in Control of Paychex prior to the payment of all or a portion of his or her Account Balance, any remaining portion of the Account Balance shall be paid in accordance with Section 6.04 or Section 6.05, as applicable.
Payment upon Separation from Service
     6.04 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, if a Participant dies before he or she has received a complete distribution of his or her Account Balance, the Participant's Account Balance shall be payable in accordance with the terms of Section 7.01 in a lump sum within 90 days of the date on which the Committee is notified in writing of the Participant's death, or as soon as administratively practicable thereafter, but no later than the December 31st of the year of death, or if later, the 15th day of the third month following the date of death.
Payment upon Death of Participant
     6.05 . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in a Participant's Distribution Election or otherwise, in the event of a Change in Control of Paychex, if such Change of Control constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of Paychex, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Paychex, each with the meaning given such terms by Section 409A, then: (a) the Plan shall be terminated upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, to the extent permissible under and in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A; and (b) the Account Balance of each Participant's Account will be paid out in a lump sum upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
Payment upon Change in Control of Paychex
     6.06 . Notwithstanding the terms of Section 6.03 and Section 6.05, if a Participant experiences a Separation from Service and the Participant is a Specified Employee at the time of Separation from Service, and the payment of the Participant's Account is required to be delayed by six months pursuant to Section 409A, then the payment of the Participant's Account Balance shall be made or commence no earlier than the six-month anniversary of the Participant's Separation from Service. "Specified Employee" as of a given date means a as of such date "specified employee" for purposes of Section 409A.
Six-Month Delay for Specified Employees
     6.07 . In the event that a Participant experiences an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant may petition the Committee to receive a partial or full payout of the Account Balance of the Participant's Account. The Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether the requested payout shall be made, and the amount of the payout; provided, however, that the payout shall not exceed the amount reasonably needed to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution. In making its determination under this Section 6.07, the Committee shall be guided by the requirements of Section 409A, and the Committee shall take into account the extent to which a Participant's Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or
Withdrawal in the Event of an Unforeseeable Emergency
 
otherwise or by the liquidation by the Participant of his or her assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). If, subject to the sole discretion of the Committee, the petition for a payout is approved, the payout shall be made within 30 days of the date of approval, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than 90 days.
     6.08 . Distributions under the Plan shall be paid in cash.
Form of Payment
     7.01 .
Designation of Beneficiaries
     (a) Each Participant may designate from time to time any person or persons (who may be named contingently or successively) to receive such benefits as may be payable under the Plan upon or after the Participant's death, and such designation may be changed from time to time by the Participant by filing a new designation. Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant under the Plan once filed with the Committee, shall be made on a form provided by the Committee for such purpose, and will be effective only when filed in writing with the Committee during the Participant's lifetime.
     (b) In the absence of a valid Beneficiary designation, or if, at the time any benefit payment is due to a Beneficiary, there is no living Beneficiary validly named by the Participant, the Committee shall direct distribution of any such benefit payment to the Participant's spouse, if then living, but otherwise to the Participant's then living descendants, if any, per stirpes, but, if none, to the Participant's estate. In determining the existence or identity of anyone entitled to a benefit payment, the Committee may rely conclusively upon information supplied by the Participant's personal representative, executor or administrator. If a question arises as to the existence or identity of anyone entitled to receive a benefit payment as aforesaid, or if a dispute arises with respect to any such payment, then, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may direct the distribution of such payment to the Participant's estate without liability for any tax or other consequences which might flow therefrom, or may take such other action as it deems to be appropriate.
     7.02 . Any communication, statement or notice addressed to a Participant or to a Beneficiary at his or her last post office address as shown on the Company's records shall be binding on the Participant or Beneficiary for all purposes of the Plan. The Committee shall not be obliged to search for any Participant or Beneficiary beyond the sending of a registered letter to such last known address. If the Committee sends notice in this fashion to any Participant or Beneficiary that he or she is entitled to an amount under the Plan and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim such amount or make his or her location known to the Committee within three years thereafter, then, except as otherwise required by law, the Committee may, in complete satisfaction of any claim by or through such Participant or Beneficiary, direct distribution as if the Participant or Beneficiary had died or, if the Committee cannot locate the person or persons who is the proper payee in the event of the Participant's or Beneficiary's death, may direct that the amount payable shall be deemed to be a forfeiture.
Information to Be Furnished By Participants and Beneficiaries; Inability to Locate Participants or Beneficiaries
 
     8.01 . The Company may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part by the actions of the Committee; , , that (a) no amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease or restrict the value of a Participant's Account Balance in existence at the time the amendment or modification is made, calculated as if the Participant had experienced a Separation from Service as of the effective date of the amendment or modification, and (b) no amendment or modification may be made if such amendment or modification would cause the Plan to fail to comply with, or cause a Participant to be subject to tax under, the provisions of Section 409A.
Amendment
provided
however
     8.02 . Although the Company may anticipate that it will continue the Plan for an indefinite period of time, there is no guarantee that the Company will continue the Plan or will not terminate the Plan at any time in the future. Accordingly, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board reserves the right to discontinue its sponsorship of the Plan and to terminate the Plan. In addition, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, the Board may at any time terminate an Affiliate's participation in the Plan.
Termination
     9.01 . This Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Members of the Committee may be Participants under the Plan. The Committee shall also have the discretion and authority to (a) make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan and (b) decide or resolve any and all questions including interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan. Any individual serving on the Committee who is a Participant shall not vote or act on any matter relating solely to himself or herself. When making a determination or calculation, the Committee shall be entitled to rely on information furnished by a Participant or the Company. The decision or action of the Committee with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
Committee Duties
     9.02 . In the administration of the Plan, the Committee may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed representative) and may from time to time consult with counsel who may be counsel to the Company.
Agents
     10.01 . The Plan is intended to be (a) a plan that is not qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and (b) a plan that "is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2),
Status of Plan
 
301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1). The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
     10.02 . It is intended that the Plan (including all amendments thereto) comply with provisions of Section 409A, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any benefits accrued hereunder in a taxable year prior to the taxable year or years in which such amount would otherwise be actually distributed or made available to the Participants. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with that intent.
Section 409A
     10.03 . Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in any property or assets of the Company. For purposes of the payment of benefits under the Plan, any and all of the Company's assets, shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged unrestricted assets of the Company. The Company's obligation under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
Unsecured General Creditor
     10.04 . Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure, attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency or be transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.
Nonassignability
     10.05 . The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract with the Company for the Participant to serve on the Board. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Company as a Director.
Not a Contract of Service
     10.06 . Whenever any words are used herein in the masculine, they shall be construed as though they were in the feminine in all cases where they would so apply; and whenever any words are used herein in the singular or in the plural, they shall be construed as though they were used in the plural or the singular, as the case may be, in all cases where they would so apply.
Terms
     10.07 . The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.
Captions
     10.08 . Subject to ERISA, the provisions of the Plan shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
Governing Law
 
     10.09 . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Committee under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the address below:

Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the Participant.
     10.10 . The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Company and its successors and assigns.
Successors
     10.11 . In case any provision of the Plan shall be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.

SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 17, 2008  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced net income of $140.2 million for the three months ended November 30, 2008 (the "second quarter"), a 5% decrease from net income of $147.1 million for the same period last year. "Our revenue for the second quarter grew to $524.2 million, a 3% increase over $507.8 million for the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items, for the second quarter increased 7%, and we continued to leverage expenses as operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue improved well over 50 basis points compared to the same period last year," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "During the second quarter, the effects of the credit crisis and weakening economic conditions were clearly seen in our financial results. While the credit crisis reduced the returns on our investment portfolios, we managed our investments in a manner that protected principal and ensured we met the liquidity needs of our clients each and every day. The weakening economy was apparent in many of our key financial indicators. Over the past six months, we experienced companies going out of business increasing 12%, new business starts declining 13%, checks per client decreasing 1.5%, and we saw lower levels of new hire reporting."
     Payroll service revenue increased 4% to $376.1 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to price increases and growth in the utilization of ancillary payroll services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 11% to $128.3 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following: comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 11% to 445,000 client employees served; workers' compensation insurance client base increased 11% to 75,000 clients; and retirement services client base increased 10% to 50,000 clients. Human Resource Services revenue growth was adversely affected in the second quarter with the most significant declines occurring within retirement services and workers' compensation. During the second quarter, retirement services revenue was negatively impacted by $2.2 million due to the decline in market values, which decreased the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds 22% to $7.2 billion, and clients' employees moving their retirement portfolios to safer investments. Fluctuations in workers' compensation claims further reduced revenue growth by $1.5 million.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $211.9 million, an increase of 1% over the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description) increased 7% to $192.1 million for the second quarter as compared to $178.8 million for the same period last year.
 
 
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. In the current financial markets, this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 36% to $19.8 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates earned. Investment income decreased 74% to $1.9 million primarily due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, which resulted from the funding of the stock repurchase program completed in December 2007.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     Our exposure has been limited in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing in primarily high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the securities we invest in have active markets.
     As of November 30, 2008, we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes or prime money market funds. We sold all of our holdings in these types of investments in September 2008 as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No losses were recognized on these sales. The proceeds from the sale of these investments were reinvested into United States agency discount notes, which is currently our primary short-term investment option. We do not hold any auction rate securities in our investment portfolios. We exited the auction rate market in the early fall of 2007 and never experienced a failed auction. We have no exposure to sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $32.5 million as of November 30, 2008, compared with a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During the six months ended November 30, 2008, the net unrealized gain/(loss) on our investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of $39.8 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $31.6 million as of December 12, 2008.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2008 are as follows:
 
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009") has been revised to reflect the impacts of current economic and financial conditions, and assumes the economic weakness we have experienced will continue through the remainder of the fiscal year.
     Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows:
     Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to approximate 5% to 8% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax rate is higher than the prior year due to lower levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

EXHIBIT 99.1
March 25, 2009
THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 25, 2009  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $528.6 million for the three months ended February 28, 2009 (the "third quarter"), a decrease of 1% from $532.2 million for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $130.8 million and $0.36 per share, respectively.
     "Our financial results continue to be challenged by weakening economic conditions in the third quarter, as many of our key indicators were weaker than on a year-to-date basis. The most significant change was in the area of checks per client, which declined 4.3% for the third quarter compared to 2.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2009. On a positive note, operating income, net of certain items, increased 8% for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 and improved as a percentage of service revenue from 36.6% to 37.4%," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "We expect the difficult economic conditions will continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2009 and into fiscal 2010. Our people have responded well in managing expenses and we expect to generate a record for operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue for the full year fiscal 2009. During the first nine months of fiscal 2009, our total cash and corporate investments increased more than $100 million to a little over $570 million. Our dividend payout ratio was 80% of net income for the first nine months."
     Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $381.2 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to price increases and growth in the utilization of ancillary payroll services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 9% to $131.0 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following: comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees increased 6% to 432,000 client employees served; workers' compensation insurance client base increased 8% to 75,000 clients; and retirement services client base increased 6% to 50,000 clients. However, Human Resource Services revenue growth continues to be affected by weakening economic conditions with the most significant impacts to retirement services and comprehensive human resource outsourcing services. Retirement services revenue growth was negatively impacted by $3.0 million in the third quarter due to the decline in market values, which decreased the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds 23% to $7.2 billion, and clients' employees moving their retirement portfolios to safer investments. Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a lower number of employees per client, reducing revenue by $2.9 million in the third quarter.
     For the third quarter, our operating income was $197.4 million, a decrease of 6% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description) increased 5% to $181.0 million for the third quarter as compared to $173.0 million for the same period last year.
 
 
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. With the turmoil in the financial markets, this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 56% to $16.4 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances. Investment income decreased 70% to $1.1 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     Our exposure has been limited in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing in primarily high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments we held as of February 28, 2009 are traded in active markets.
     As of February 28, 2009, we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes or prime money market funds. Our primary short term investment option is currently United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes. We have no exposure to auction rate securities, sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.8 million as of February 28, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During the nine months ended February 28, 2009, the net unrealized gain/(loss) on our investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of $86.6 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $65.5 million as of March 20, 2009.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the nine months ended February 28, 2009 are as follows:

OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the full fiscal year ending May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009") has been revised to reflect the impacts of current economic and financial conditions, and assumes the economic weakness we have experienced will continue through the remainder of the fiscal year.
     Projected revenue and net income growth for fiscal 2009 are as follows:
     Growth in operating income, net of certain items, is expected to approximate 5% to 8% for fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 34% throughout fiscal 2009. The tax rate is higher than the prior year due to lower levels of tax-exempt income from securities held in our investment portfolios.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, June 24, 2009  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $2.1 billion for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009"), a 1% increase over the prior fiscal year. Net income decreased 7% to $533.5 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $1.48 per share.
     "Fiscal 2009 was one of the most challenging years in Paychex history. We were faced with many difficulties including the weakest economic conditions we have ever experienced, a severe credit crisis, and extremely low investment rates of return on our funds held for clients. Despite this, our team responded well to the challenge by delivering record levels of operating income, net of certain items. In addition, despite this volatile period, we continued to grow revenue, expand our operating margins, invest in our business, and provide excellent customer service," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "Our financial position remains strong with cash and total corporate investments increasing approximately $140 million during fiscal 2009. We generated this growth while paying 84% of our net income in dividends to our stockholders," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue increased 1% over the prior fiscal year to $1.5 billion. The increase was primarily due to our annual price increase and growth in the utilization of ancillary payroll services, offset by weak economic conditions that adversely impacted revenue growth. Weak economic conditions resulted in a year over year decrease of 3.1% in our client base, a 2.9% decrease in checks per client, a 19% decrease in new client sales from new business starts, and a 17% increase in clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees. As of May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, 93% of our clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, and nearly all of our new clients purchase these services. Employee payment services utilization was 75% as of May 31, 2009 compared to 73% as of May 31, 2008, with over 80% of our new clients selecting these services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 11% to $523.6 million for fiscal 2009. Growth in these services was generated from the following: comprehensive human resource outsourcing services clients increased 10% to 18,000 with client employees increasing 3% to 453,000; workers' compensation insurance clients increased 6% to 77,000, and retirement services clients increased 2% to 50,000. Health and benefits services revenue, our newest offering, grew 70% to $20.9 million for fiscal 2009.
     Human Resource Services revenue growth was adversely impacted by weak economic conditions with the most significant impact in retirement services and comprehensive human resource outsourcing services. Retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 was negatively affected by $8.9 million due to a decline in the asset value of the retirement services client employees' funds, which decreased 12% to $8.5 billion, and a shift in client employees' retirement portfolios to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers. Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per client, decreasing revenue by $8.7 million for fiscal 2009. Offsetting some of the above revenue declines was $12.4 million of retirement services billings for client plan restatements during fiscal 2009 that are required by law approximately every ten years.
 
 
     For fiscal 2009, our operating income was $805.2 million, a decrease of 3% from the prior fiscal year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure) increased 5% to $729.7 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to $696.5 million for the prior fiscal year.
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. With the turmoil in the financial markets, this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. For fiscal 2009, interest on funds held for clients decreased 43% to $75.5 million due to lower average interest rates earned, lower average investment balances, and lower realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities. Overall economic factors, which have negatively impacted our client base, decreased average investment balances by 3% for fiscal 2009. Average investment balances for the three months ended May 31, 2009 (the "fourth quarter"), which deteriorated 9%, were also impacted by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "2009 economic stimulus package") generating lower tax withholdings for client employees. Investment income decreased 74% to $6.9 million primarily due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, which resulted from the funding of the stock repurchase program that was completed in December 2007.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     Our exposure has been minimized in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments held as of May 31, 2009 are traded in active markets.
     As of May 31, 2009, we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes or prime money market funds.  Our current primary short-term investment vehicle is United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes. We have no exposure to auction rate securities, sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During fiscal 2009, the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of $86.6 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $56.3 million as of June 19, 2009.

FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2009 HIGHLIGHTS
     Our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 fully reflect the weak economic conditions, which impacted earlier quarters to a lesser degree. Checks per client declined 5.2% for the fourth quarter, compared to 4.3% for the third quarter and 2.9% for the full year. Below is a summary of our fourth quarter financial results:
OUTLOOK
     Our current outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Comparisons to fiscal 2009 quarters are expected to improve as fiscal 2010 progresses. Projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are as follows:
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2010. The higher tax rate in fiscal 2010 is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected 5% decline in average invested balances, with most of the effect in the first half of fiscal 2010. This decline is largely the result of the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees. The Federal Funds rate dropped significantly in fiscal 2009 from 2.00% as of May 31, 2008, to a range of zero to 0.25% as of May 31, 2009. As of May 31, 2009, the long-term investment portfolio had an average yield-to-maturity of 3.3% and an average duration of 2.5 years. In the next twelve months, slightly less than 20% of this portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.40%. Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income to (decrease)/increase by the following amounts in the respective quarters of fiscal 2010:

Overview
     We are a leading provider of comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs.
 
     Our Payroll services are provided through either our core payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:
     In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service solution through the MMS platform provides human resource management, employee benefits management, time and attendance, online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance while providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary services; leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.
     Our financial results for fiscal 2009 were affected by weak economic conditions in the U.S., the severe credit crisis in the financial markets, and extremely low investment rates of return on our funds held for clients. The weak economy affects our ability to sell and retain clients, reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in our client base, and results in lower average invested balances in our funds held for clients. The impacts were reflected in many of our key indicators, with the most significant deterioration occurring in the three months ending May 31, 2009 (the "fourth quarter"), as follows:
 
     Despite the economic pressures, we achieved service revenue growth of 4% over the prior fiscal year as a result of our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll and Human Resource Services. We effectively managed our expenses as operating income, net of certain items, increased 5% and improved as a percentage of service revenue to 36.4% for fiscal 2009 as compared to 36.0% for fiscal 2008. Refer to the discussion below for further information on operating income, net of certain items.
     Our financial results for fiscal 2009 included the following highlights:
     In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the SEC. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 5% to $729.7 million for fiscal 2009 compared to $696.5 million for fiscal 2008 and $605.4 million for fiscal 2007.
     Although we have been operating in an unprecedented economic environment during fiscal 2009, we maintained stability in our employee base, allowing us to continue to focus on providing excellent customer service, and invest in our business. Some of these investments include the following:
       Our client base was approximately 554,000 clients as of May 31, 2009. This compares with approximately 572,000 clients as of May 31, 2008, and approximately 561,000 clients as of May 31, 2007. Our client base declined 3.1% for fiscal 2009, compared to growth of 2.0% for fiscal 2008 and growth of 3.3% for fiscal 2007. The reduction in our client base for fiscal 2009 reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on our ability to attract and retain clients. New client sales from new business starts decreased 19% for fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. Also, an increase of 17% in clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees impacted our client retention, which was slightly below historical levels at approximately 77% of our beginning of the year client base.
Client base and increased utilization of ancillary services:
     Despite the challenging selling environment resulting from the weak economy, we added over 111,000 clients during fiscal 2009. New sales revenue for MMS clients was strong for fiscal 2009, increasing just under 20% compared to fiscal 2008. The market for MMS has not been as severely impacted by the decline in new business starts.
 
     We believe growth opportunities continue to exist in our target market of small- to medium-sized businesses. Accordingly, we continue to increase the size of our sales force in key areas, primarily MMS and health and benefits services. Reductions are expected in certain of the Human Resource Services sales force due to deceleration in client bases and aggressive sales force increases in prior periods. The following table summarizes the expected composition of our sales force in fiscal 2010 with comparisons to fiscal 2009 and 2008:
     There are also opportunities for growth within our current client base, as well as with new clients, through increased penetration of our payroll and human resource ancillary services and products. Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings:
       During fiscal 2009, we made investments in the ongoing expansion of our portfolio of services and products. These included strengthening our software-as-a-service solution for our MMS clients through the following:
Service and product initiatives:
     In addition, other fiscal 2009 initiatives included the following:
       We may supplement our growth from time to time through strategic acquisitions when opportunities arise. In fiscal 2009, we made immaterial acquisitions to supplement our payroll client base.
Business acquisitions:
 
      Integral to our strategy is satisfied customers to achieve maximum client retention. For fiscal 2009, we received high client satisfaction results, which was encouraging considering the economic pressures our clients are facing. Client retention was approximately 77% of our beginning of the year client base. Although customer satisfaction remained strong, increases in clients going out of business or no longer having any employees, and pricing pressures from our largest direct competitor and regional payroll providers kept our client retention rate slightly below historical levels.
Focus on customer service:
       The current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets, with diminished liquidity and increased exposure to investment losses occurring in these markets. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2009, our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $574.7 million and no debt. Our cash and total corporate investments have increased approximately $140 million since May 31, 2008.
Financial position and liquidity:
     We also believe that our investments as of May 31, 2009 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. We maintain a conservative investment strategy within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal. In the current financial markets, this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Our exposure has been minimized in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All investments held as of May 31, 2009 are traded in active markets.
     As of May 31, 2009, we had no exposure to variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") or prime money market funds. In September 2008, we sold all of our holdings in these types of investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No losses were recognized on these sales. The proceeds from the sale of these investments were reinvested in U.S. agency discount notes, which is our current primary short-term investment vehicle. We have no exposure to auction rate securities, sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $688.8 million for fiscal 2009. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2009, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future. During fiscal 2009, dividends paid to stockholders were 84% of net income.
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, and our financial position as of May 31, 2009, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this review.
Outlook
     Our current outlook for fiscal 2010 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Comparisons to fiscal 2009 quarters are expected to improve as fiscal 2010 progresses. Projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are as follows:
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range between 34% and 35% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2010. The higher tax rate in fiscal 2010 is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected 5% decline in average invested balances, with most of the effect in the first half of fiscal 2010. This decline is largely the result of the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees. The Federal Funds rate dropped significantly in fiscal 2009 from 2.00% as of May 31, 2008, to a range of zero to 0.25% as of May 31, 2009. As of May 31, 2009, the long-term investment portfolio had an average yield-to-maturity of 3.3% and an average duration of 2.5 years. In the next twelve months, slightly less than 20% of this portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.40%. Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income to (decrease)/increase by the following amounts in the respective quarters of fiscal 2010:
     Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our earnings from a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in the short-term interest rates would be approximately $3.5 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate. We estimate the lowest level of combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income over the next fiscal year would be approximately $55 million.
     Purchases of property and equipment in fiscal 2010 are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million. Fiscal 2010 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2009, we had no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
       Payroll service revenue increased 1% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2009 due to our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services. Payroll service revenue increased 8% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2008 due to client base growth, higher check volume, our annual price increase, and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services. The weakening economic conditions in fiscal 2009 negatively impacted payroll service revenue. During fiscal 2009, our client base declined 3.1%, affected by a decline in new client sales from new business starts and clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees. Also, checks per client declined 2.9%.
Payroll service revenue:
     As of May 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, 93% of clients utilized our payroll tax administration services. Our employee payment services were utilized by 75% of our clients as of May 31, 2009, compared with 73% as of May 31, 2008 and 71% as of May 31, 2007. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients select a form of our employee payment services.
 
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 11% for fiscal 2009 and 19% for fiscal 2008 to $523.6 million and $471.8 million, respectively. The following factors contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008:
Human Resource Services revenue:
     While the above factors contributed to the revenue growth as compared to the same period last year, the rate of growth has been adversely impacted by weak economic conditions. The volatility in the financial markets has caused the asset value of retirement services client employees' funds to decline 12% to $8.5 billion as of May 31, 2009 as compared to the same period last year. The S&P 500 declined 34% during the same period. The decline in asset value and a shift in client employees' retirement portfolios to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced retirement services revenue growth by $8.9 million for fiscal 2009. Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per client, decreasing revenue by $8.7 million for fiscal 2009. The estimated growth in Human Resource Services revenue for fiscal 2009 would have been 15% exclusive of these two items. We also continue to experience volatility in PEO net service revenue due to fluctuations in workers' compensation claims and adjustments to workers' compensation rates in Florida. Offsetting some of the above revenue declines was $12.4 million of retirement services billings for client plan restatements during fiscal 2009 that are required by law approximately every ten years.
     Total service revenue growth was 4% for fiscal 2009 and 10% for fiscal 2008. The weak economy had a negative impact on service revenue growth for fiscal 2009. Refer to the discussion of key indicators in the "Overview" section of this review.
Total service revenue:
     The decrease in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned, lower average investment balances, and lower realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Interest on funds held for clients decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances and higher realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Overall economic factors, which have negatively impacted our client base, decreased average investment balances by 3% for fiscal 2009. Average investment balances for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, which deteriorated 9%, also were impacted by the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees. Refer to the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review for more information on changing interest rates.
Interest on funds held for clients:
       The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31:
Combined operating and SG&A expenses:
     During fiscal 2007, we recorded an expense charge of $38.0 million to increase our litigation reserve to account for settlements and for anticipated costs relating to pending legal matters.
     Excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve, combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 3% for fiscal 2009 and 8% for fiscal 2008. This was primarily the result of increases in personnel, though at a slower pace than prior years, and other costs related to selling and retaining clients, and promoting new services. The lower growth rates in compensation-related expenses for fiscal 2009 are a result of lower bonus and commission expenses attributed to the more challenging selling environment given the weak economic conditions and the slower pace of new hires. As of May 31, 2009, we had approximately 12,500 employees compared with approximately 12,200 as of May 31, 2008 and 11,700 as of May 31, 2007.
 
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. The increases in amortization are a result of intangibles from acquisitions and client list acquisitions. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
       Operating income declined 3% for fiscal 2009 as compared to growth of 18% for fiscal 2008. The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating income:
     Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2007 to increase the litigation reserve. Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the "Overview" section of this review. Operating income, net of certain items, is as follows for the year ended May 31:
       Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The decrease in investment income for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances. The decrease in investment income for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 was primarily due to lower average investment balances. The lower average investment balances in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were a result of funding the stock repurchase program which was completed in December 2007.
Investment income, net:
       Our effective income tax rate was 34.3% for fiscal 2009, compared with 32.6% for fiscal 2008, and 30.7% for fiscal 2007. The increases in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income, derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. The increase for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was impacted by a higher effective state income tax rate as a result of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."
Income taxes:
       Net income declined 7% for fiscal 2009, decreasing to $533.5 million, as compared to a net income growth of 12% to $576.1 million for fiscal 2008. These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed. In particular, for fiscal 2009, combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income decreased 48%, or $76.0 million. Net income growth for fiscal 2008 was impacted by the increase to the litigation reserve of $38.0 million recognized in fiscal 2007.
Net income and earnings per share:
     Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% for fiscal 2009 to $1.48 per share as compared to a 16% increase for fiscal 2008 to $1.56 per share. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2008 increased at a rate higher than net income growth, and for fiscal 2009 decreased at a rate lower than the decrease in net income due to a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program completed in December 2007. In fiscal 2009, earnings per share were reduced by $0.16 per share as a result of the decline in combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income noted above and the 2.9% decline in checks per client.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     The current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets, with diminished liquidity and increased exposure to investment losses occurring in these markets. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2009, our financial position remained strong as we had $574.7 million in cash and total corporate investments and no debt. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2009 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date to indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. Cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2009, along with projected operating cash flows, are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
 
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     As of May 31, 2009, we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:
Lines of credit:
     Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2009 or as of May 31, 2009.
     JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also parties to our credit facility and irrevocable standby letters of credit. See discussion of these arrangements below.
     : We have a committed, secured, one-year revolving credit facility, expiring on September 20, 2009. This credit facility was available to extend the duration of our long-term investment portfolio. We have not used the credit facility during fiscal 2009 or as of May 31, 2009, and we do not have plans for it in the future. The credit facility is collateralized by the long-term securities of Paychex of New York LLC (the "Borrower"), to the extent of any borrowing. Under the credit facility the Borrower may, subject to certain restrictions, borrow up to $400 million to meet short-term funding requirements on client fund obligations. Upon expiration of the commitment in September 2009, any borrowings outstanding will mature and be payable on such date.
Credit facility
     The revolving loans under the credit facility will bear interest at competitive rates to be elected by the Borrower. The Borrower will also pay a facility fee at a rate of .05% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the commitment.
     As of May 31, 2009, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $65.8 million, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies and bonding requirements. These letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2009 and December 2012 and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2009 or as of May 31, 2009.
Letters of credit:
 
     We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2009. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments, as well as other contractual obligations shown as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of May 31, 2009:
Other commitments:
 
     Advantage has license agreements with independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex, Inc. and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. When we acquired Advantage, there were fifteen Associates. As of May 31, 2009, we have ten Associates. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 was $12.3 million and $15.3 million, respectively.
     We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees and indemnifications.
     We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain of our employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1% of our total assets as of May 31, 2009.
Reclassification Within Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
     Client fund obligations represent our contractual obligation to remit funds to satisfy clients' payroll and tax payment obligations. To better reflect the nature of these activities, in fiscal 2008 we reclassified the net change in client fund obligations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows from investing activities to financing activities for all periods presented. This reclassification had no impact on the net change in cash and cash equivalents or cash flows from operating activities for any periods presented.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 is attributable to lower net income. The increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 reflects higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and intangible assets. The decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to the expense charge of $38.0 million to increase the litigation reserve in fiscal 2007, offset by an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to lower interest receivable balances and the timing of collection and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
       Funds held for clients consist of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. Fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. During fiscal 2008, proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities were not reinvested as a result of the $1.0 billion stock repurchase program completed in December 2007. In fiscal 2009, with the volatility in the financial markets, funds previously invested in certain available-for-sale securities were reinvested in cash equivalents. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
       To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007, we purchased approximately $4.5 million, $4.4 million, and $2.8 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the "Board").
Purchases of long-lived assets:
 
     Construction in progress totaled $4.0 million and $52.1 million as of May 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these costs, $3.4 million and $51.6 million represent software being developed for internal use as of May 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capitalization of costs ceases when the software is ready for its intended use, at which time we begin amortization of the costs. During the last three months of fiscal 2009, a significant portion of the internal use software costs previously in construction in progress were placed in service. These internal use software costs are being amortized over fifteen years, at a rate of approximately $4.0 million annually.
     During fiscal 2009, we paid $6.4 million related to acquisitions of businesses, compared with $32.9 million and $3.1 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Fiscal 2008 acquisitions related mainly to employee benefits products. The purchases of other assets were for customer lists.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days.
Net change in client fund obligations:
     We repurchased 23.7 million shares of common stock for a total of $1.0 billion under our stock repurchase program completed in December 2007.
Repurchases of common stock:
       In July 2008, our Board approved a 3% increase in our quarterly dividend payment to $0.31 per share from $0.30 per share. In July 2007, our Board approved an increase of 43% in the quarterly dividend payment to $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 84%, 77%, and 58% for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007, respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
       Proceeds from and excess tax benefit related to exercise of stock options decreased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, and increased for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options for fiscal 2009 were 0.4 million shares compared with 2.0 million shares for fiscal 2008 and 1.8 million shares for fiscal 2007.
Exercise of stock options:

In April 2009, the FASB issued the following three staff positions intended to provide additional accounting guidance and enhance disclosures regarding fair value measurements and impairments of debt securities:
New accounting pronouncements:
 
     These FSPs are effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009, and are applicable to our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of these FSPs will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.
     In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 165, "Subsequent Events." This statement establishes guidance related to accounting for and disclosure of events that happen after the date of the balance sheet but before the release of the financial statements.  SFAS No. 165 is effective for reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and is applicable to our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.  
     In June 2009, the FASB issued the following statements:
     Both standards are effective for annual periods beginning after November 15, 2009, and are applicable to our fiscal year beginning June 1, 2010. We are currently evaluating both standards but do not expect their adoption to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
     Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the SEC did not, or are not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.
Critical Accounting Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
       Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred were $2.6 billion for each of fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007.
     Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
     In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
       Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including social and economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
     We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
     In fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, workers' compensation insurance for PEO worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred. Our maximum individual claims liability was $1,000,000 under both the fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 policies.
     We had recorded the following amounts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for workers' compensation claims as of:
       Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value are included in comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
 
        We have $433.3 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2009, resulting from acquisitions of businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. We perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
Goodwill and other intangible assets:
     We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
       We maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients' inability to meet their payroll obligations. As part of providing payroll, payroll tax administration services, and employee payment services, we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client's account for the amount of tax obligations and employees' direct deposits. Electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients' insufficient funds to cover such transfers. We evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients.
Accrual for client fund losses:
       We are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. As of May 31, 2009, we had approximately $20.4 million of reserves for pending litigation. Based on the application of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated, we deem this amount adequate. The determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment. This reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter. In light of the litigation reserve recorded, we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded.
Contingent liabilities:
       Effective June 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, which requires that all stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, be recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option life. We estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior.
Stock-based compensation costs:
     Under SFAS No. 123R, we are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any catch-up adjustment recorded in the period of change, with the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
     We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
 
       We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock-based awards. We also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax position as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 on June 1, 2007.
Income taxes:
Market Risk Factors
       Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. We maintain a conservative investment strategy within our investment portfolios to maximize liquidity and protect principal. We attempt to mitigate the risks associated with our investing activities by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer, and by investing in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. All investments held as of May 31, 2009 are traded in active markets.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     As of May 31, 2009, we had no exposure to VRDNs or prime money market funds. In September 2008, we sold all of our holdings of these types of investments as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No losses were recognized on those sales. The proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested in U.S. agency discount notes, which are currently our primary short-term investment option. We have no exposure to auction rate securities, sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
     During fiscal 2009, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 2.1% compared with 3.7% for fiscal 2008 and 4.0% for fiscal 2007. With the turmoil currently in the financial markets, our conservative investment strategy translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments. When interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate environment, the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short-term investments, and over time decrease earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from available-for-sale securities, which as of May 31, 2009 had an average duration of 2.5 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates. In the next twelve months, slightly less than 20% of our available-for-sale portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.40%.
     The cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2009 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
 
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
 
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:
     Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $3.9 billion for fiscal 2009. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 50% invested in short-term securities and available-for-sale securities with an average duration of less than 30 days, and 50% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of $24.8 million as of May 31, 2008. During fiscal 2009, the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of $86.6 million. During fiscal 2008, the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $24.3 million to a net unrealized gain of $48.7 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $56.3 million as of June 19, 2009.
     As of May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, we had $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity was 3.3% and 3.4%, as of May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes available-for-sale securities tied to short-term interest rates such as the VRDNs held as of May 31, 2008. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available-for-sale securities as of May 31, 2009, would be approximately $11.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other-than-temporary.
       We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer.
Credit risk:
 
     We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as of May 31, 2009 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. While certain available-for-sale securities had fair values that were below cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the decline in the fair value was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk. As of May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, the majority of the securities with an unrealized loss held an AA rating or better. We currently believe that we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

EXHIBIT 99.1
September 23, 2009
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 23, 2009  Paychex, Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $500.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009 (the "first quarter"), a decrease of 6% from $534.1 million for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 17% to $123.6 million and $0.34 per share, respectively.
     "The weak economic conditions, credit crisis in the financial markets, and extremely low investment rates of return that we experienced during fiscal 2009 continue to challenge our financial results for fiscal 2010. While we have not seen improvement in any of our key indicators, we have not seen any significant deterioration either. On a positive note, this is the first quarter in the last four sequential quarters that we have not had a noticeable decline in checks per client. The largest sequential decline in fiscal 2009 peaked in the third quarter at 2.2%," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.
     "We have remained steadfast in providing excellent customer service and investing in our business, while continuing to control expenses. Our financial position remains strong with significant cash and total corporate investments and no debt as of August 31, 2009," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue decreased 6% to $354.4 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. Weak economic conditions negatively impacted our client growth, check volume, and revenue per check. Our checks per client decreased 5.0% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Our client base growth has been adversely impacted by weak new business starts and continued client losses from companies going out of business.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 1% to $132.1 million for the first quarter from the same period last year. Contributing to Human Resource Services revenue growth in the quarter, as compared to the same quarter last year are: an increase of 4% for comprehensive human resource outsourcing services client employees served to 463,000; an increase of 10% for comprehensive human resource outsourcing services clients to 18,000; and an increase of 5% for workers' compensation insurance clients to 78,000 as of August 31, 2009. In addition, health and benefits services revenue grew 39% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.
     The asset value of retirement services client employees' funds increased 2% year-over-year to $9.6 billion as of August 31, 2009 (up 34% compared to our lowest fiscal 2009 asset value of $7.2 billion as of February 28, 2009), due to retirement plans converting with existing assets. However, the shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees' funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers has generated lower revenue than the same quarter last year. The impact from weak economic conditions on our payroll client base has nearly offset our revenue growth from Human Resource Services, as these ancillary services are most often provided to our payroll clients. The most significant impacts have been to retirement services and comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue.
 
     Total expenses decreased 1% to $310.3 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This decline is primarily due to overall cost control measures and stable headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in key areas of our sales force and our technological infrastructure.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $189.9 million, a decrease of 14% from the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description) decreased 11% to $176.2 million for the first quarter as compared to $197.4 million for the same period last year.
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. With the turmoil in the financial markets, this translates to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We are seeing gradual improvements in liquidity for high quality money market securities and are beginning to explore opportunities to invest a portion of the short-term portfolio in investments other than United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes.
     For the first quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 43% to $13.7 million due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased 10% for the first quarter compared to the prior year period. This decline was a result of overall economic factors, which have negatively impacted our client base, and the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "2009 economic stimulus package") generating lower tax withholdings for client employees. Investment income decreased 70% to $0.9 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     Our exposure has been limited in the current investment environment as the result of our policies of investing in primarily high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments we held as of August 31, 2009 are traded in active markets. In the current investment market, our primary short-term investment vehicle is U.S. agency discount notes. We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $68.6 million as of August 31, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $76.7 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $74.8 million as of September 18, 2009.
 
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010") reflects the impact of current economic and financial conditions, and assumes these conditions will continue through the remainder of the fiscal year. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Comparisons to the prior year are expected to improve in the second half of fiscal 2010.
     Projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are as follows:
     Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% throughout fiscal 2010. The higher tax rate in fiscal 2010 is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility. Interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected 7% decline in average invested balances, with most of the effect in the first half of fiscal 2010. This decline is largely the result of the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees.
     Based upon current interest rate and economic conditions, we expect interest on funds held for clients and investment income to (decrease)/increase by the following amounts in the remaining respective quarters of fiscal 2010:
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

December 16, 2009
SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 16, 2009  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $496.6 million for the three months ended November 30, 2009 (the "second quarter"), a 5% decrease from the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 10% to $125.8 million and $0.35 per share, respectively.
     "Our financial results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations, and our guidance for the full year fiscal 2010 remains unchanged. The economic environment has continued to influence our results causing unfavorable year-over-year comparisons. On a positive note, our key indicators have been stable for the second quarter in a row," commented Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. "We continue to provide excellent customer service, invest in our business while remaining cost conscious, and are positioned to capitalize on our opportunities as the economy recovers," added Mr. Judge.
     Payroll service revenue decreased 7% to $350.8 million for the second quarter from the same period last year as the impact of the weakened economic environment negatively impacted our client base and check volume. Our checks per client decreased 3.7% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year, an improvement from the 5.0% year-over-year decline for the three months ended August 31, 2009 (the "first quarter"). Our client base has been adversely impacted by weak new business starts.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 3% to $132.2 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. The following factors contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth:
     In addition, Human Resource Services revenue for the second quarter was positively impacted by a 54% increase in health and benefits services revenue and favorability in PEO net service revenue from fluctuations in workers' compensation claims.
     Offsetting some of this revenue growth has been the impact from weak economic conditions. The most significant impacts have been to retirement services and comprehensive human resource outsourcing services. The asset value of retirement services client employees' funds has increased 43% from the same period last year to $10.3 billion as of November 30, 2009, as a result of recovery in the financial markets. The positive impact of the market recovery on second quarter revenue was offset by retirement services client employees shifting the mix of assets invested to funds earning lower fees. Also, retirement services revenue growth was impacted by $3.4 million for billings in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 related to statutory required restatements of clients' retirement plans which are not expected to recur for approximately six years.
 
     During the second quarter, we sold Stromberg time and attendance, an immaterial component of Paychex. Human Resource Services revenue growth excluding Stromberg revenue and retirement plan restatement billings would have been 2% for the first quarter, 9% for the second quarter, and 5% for the six months ended November 30, 2009.
     Total expenses decreased 3% to $303.5 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. This decline was primarily due to overall cost control measures and lower headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force for key areas, customer service, and technological infrastructure.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $193.1 million, a decrease of 9% from the same period last year. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) decreased 7% to $179.5 million for the second quarter as compared to $192.1 million for the same period last year.
     For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 31% to $13.6 million due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased 10% for the second quarter compared to the prior year period. This decline was a result of overall economic factors, which have negatively impacted our client base, and the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "2009 economic stimulus package") generating lower tax withholdings for client employees. Investment income decreased 41% to $1.1 million for the second quarter due to lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. With the turmoil in the financial markets, this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on our funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments we held as of November 30, 2009 are traded in active markets. During the past year, our primary short-term investment vehicle has been United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes. We have seen gradual improvements in liquidity in certain money market sectors, and during the second quarter we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes.
Page 2 of 8
 
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $78.8 million as of November 30, 2009, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009. During the six months ended November 30, 2009, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $78.8 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $79.2 million as of December 11, 2009.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2009 are as follows:
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010") remains unchanged from the guidance provided at the end of the first quarter. This guidance reflects the impact of current economic and financial conditions, and assumes these conditions will continue through the remainder of the fiscal year. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates.
     Projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are as follows:
     Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients as a percentage of service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% throughout fiscal 2010. The higher tax rate in fiscal 2010 is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility, and comparisons to prior year are expected to improve in the second half of fiscal 2010. Interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected 8% decline in average invested balances for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year. This decline is the result of overall economic factors, which have negatively impacted our client base, and the 2009 economic stimulus package generating lower tax withholdings for client employees.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. Operating income excluding interest on funds held for clients is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

EXHIBIT 99.1
March 24, 2010
THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 24, 2010  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $507.8 million for the three months ended February 28, 2010 (the "third quarter"), a decrease of 4% from $528.6 million for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 14% to $112.0 million and $0.31 per share, respectively. Our results for the third quarter were impacted by an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share.
     Commenting on our results, Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are disappointed with the recent court decision to uphold a 2007 jury verdict related to Rapid Payroll, but have finally put this matter behind us. Excluding the $18.7 million expense charge, our results were as expected."
     Mr. Judge added, "For the third straight quarter, our key indicators have shown stabilization and, exclusive of certain items, we have slightly exceeded our earnings goals throughout fiscal 2010. Achieving our revenue goals has proven more difficult due to the adverse impact the economic headwinds have had on new client sales and client retention. Our client base declined 2.1% since May 31, 2009. The selling season was a difficult one as our new sales units for the nine months were down 6% from last year, primarily due to declines in new business formation and fewer companies moving to outsourcing. Client retention, while less favorable than normal, began to show some improvement as clients lost during the first nine months were 5% below the same period a year ago, with a slight improvement in these losses as a percentage of the beginning of the fiscal year client base. On a positive note, checks per client remained stable with a 2.2% reduction over the same period last year, compared to 3.7% and 5.0% for the second and first quarters of fiscal 2010. We are hopeful that the checks per client are an indicator of better times ahead.
     "Continued investment in our business, including our technological infrastructure, is critical to our success. We have invested over $60 million in an enhanced platform for our core payroll processing capability that was fully implemented by the end of our third quarter. We have successfully completed our conversion of over 470,000 clients to this platform, which allows us to leverage efficiencies in the process and continue to provide extraordinary customer service for our clients. Looking to the future, we remain focused on investing in our products, people, and service capabilities, positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth."
     Payroll service revenue decreased 6% to $358.3 million for the third quarter from the same period last year, as the cumulative impact of the weak economic environment negatively impacted our client base and check volume. Our checks per client have remained stable since last May and have decreased only 2.2% for the third quarter compared to the same period last year.
 
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 3% to $135.5 million for the third quarter from the same period last year. The following factors contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth:
     Recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to Paychex has driven the 53% increase in the asset value of retirement services client employees' funds. In addition, Human Resource Services revenue for the third quarter was positively impacted by a 54% increase in health and benefits service revenue and growth in certain Human Resource Services products that support our Major Market Services clients.
     Dampening our revenue growth has been the cumulative impact from weak economic conditions on our client base growth, especially on our retirement services. In addition, retirement services revenue growth was negatively impacted by $2.7 million in billings for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients' retirement plans required by statute, which are not expected to recur for approximately six years.
     In October 2009, we sold Stromberg time and attendance, an immaterial component of Paychex. Human Resource Services revenue growth excluding Stromberg revenue and retirement plan restatement billings would have been 10% for the third quarter and 7% for the nine months ended February 28, 2010.
     Total expenses increased 3% to $339.6 million for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The increase was a result of the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve. Excluding this expense charge, total expenses would have declined 3%. This result was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force for key areas, customer service, and technological infrastructure.
     For the third quarter, our operating income was $168.2 million, a decrease of 15% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description) decreased 4% to $172.9 million for the third quarter as compared to $181.0 million for the same period last year.
     For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 14% to $14.0 million due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, offset somewhat by higher realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased 4% for the third quarter compared to the prior year period. This decline was a result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "2009 economic stimulus package"), partially offset by the impact of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year. Investment income increased 11% to $1.2 million for the third quarter due to higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations, offset somewhat by lower average interest rates earned.
Page 2 of 8
 
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. With the turmoil in the financial markets, this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on our funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments we held as of February 28, 2010 are traded in active markets. Since September 2008, our primary short-term investment vehicle has been United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes. We have seen gradual improvements in liquidity in certain money market sectors, and in November 2009 we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $76.1 million as of February 28, 2010, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009. During the nine months ended February 28, 2010, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $82.4 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $74.9 million as of March 19, 2010.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the nine months ended February 28, 2010 are as follows:
RAPID PAYROLL, INC. LITIGATION
     During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we recognized $18.7 million of additional expense related to the Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll") litigation that commenced in August 2001, and has been previously disclosed. On March 9, 2010, the Court of Appeal of the State of California upheld a jury verdict issued on June 27, 2007 in litigation brought by one of the licensees. In that case, the California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages. Paychex will satisfy the judgment, including statutory interest, without further appeal. This is the final pending matter in the Rapid Payroll litigation.

OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010") remains unchanged from the guidance provided in September 2009. Our guidance reflects the impact of current economic and financial conditions, and assumes these conditions will continue through the remainder of the fiscal year. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates.
     Projected changes in revenue and net income for fiscal 2010 are as follows:
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal 2010. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2010. The higher tax rate in fiscal 2010 is driven by higher state income tax rates resulting from state legislative changes.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2010 are expected to be impacted by interest rate volatility, and comparisons to the prior year are expected to continue to improve in the remainder of fiscal 2010. Interest on funds held for clients will be further impacted by a projected 5% decline in average invested balances for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year. This decline is the result of the cumulative adverse effect of the weak economy on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees as a result of the 2009 economic stimulus package, partially offset by the impact of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in the third quarter to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

EXHIBIT 99.1
June 23, 2010
FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, June 23, 2010  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $2.0 billion for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010"), a decrease of 4% from $2.1 billion for the prior fiscal year ended May 31, 2009 ("fiscal 2009"). Net income and diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $477.0 million and $1.32 per share, respectively. Our results for fiscal 2010 were impacted by an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share.
      Commenting on our results, Jonathan J. Judge, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "Fiscal 2010 was a challenging year. Difficult economic conditions adversely impacted our revenue growth, as they contributed to a 3.2% decline in our client base, a 4.9% decline in new client sales, and a 2.6% decline in checks per client for fiscal 2010. On a positive note, we experienced slightly better client retention, and for the first time since the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we experienced an increase in checks per client for a quarter. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, checks per client increased 1.1%. We are encouraged by, yet remain cautious about the modest improvement we have seen in many of our key indicators as we exit fiscal 2010."
      Mr. Judge added, "We are very pleased with how our team has responded to these challenging times. Maintaining our core business strategy and remaining focused on expense management has resulted in operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue of 35.4%, which met our expectations. We continue to provide excellent customer service, invest in our business, and generate positive cash flow. We returned $448.6 million to our stockholders in the form of dividend payments."
     Payroll service revenue decreased 5% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2010, as the cumulative effect of the weak economic environment negatively impacted our client base and check volume. During fiscal 2010, our client base declined 3.2% to approximately 536,000 clients as of May 31, 2010. Our checks per client decreased 2.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to a decrease of 2.9% for fiscal 2009. Checks per client have shown modest improvement in each sequential quarter of fiscal 2010, reflecting year-over-year declines of 5.0%, 3.7%, and 2.2% for the first through third fiscal quarters, and an increase of 1.1% for the three months ended May 31, 2010 (the "fourth quarter").
     As of May 31, 2010, 94% of our clients utilized our payroll tax administration services, compared to 93% as of May 31, 2009, and nearly all of our new clients purchase these services. Employee payment services utilization was 77% as of May 31, 2010 compared to 75% as of May 31, 2009, with over 80% of our new clients selecting these services.
 
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 3% to $540.9 million for fiscal 2010. Growth in these services was generated from the following:
 
Includes workers' compensation insurance clients and health and benefits services clients.
(1)
     Recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to Paychex has driven the 33% increase in the asset value of retirement services client employees' funds. Growth in certain products that primarily support our Major Market Services clients has also positively contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth.
     Dampening our revenue growth has been the cumulative effect of weak economic conditions on our client base growth. This particularly affected retirement services, although we have seen client growth for retirement services rebound somewhat late in fiscal 2010. In addition, retirement services revenue growth was negatively impacted by $12.4 million related to billings in fiscal 2009 for client plan restatements required by statute, which are not expected to recur for approximately six years. In fiscal 2010, we sold Stromberg time and attendance, an immaterial component of Paychex. Human Resource Services revenue growth, excluding Stromberg revenue and retirement plan restatement billings, would have been 8% for both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009.
     Total expenses for fiscal 2010 were flat compared to fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, we recognized an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve. Excluding this expense charge, total expenses would have decreased 2%. This decline resulted from cost control measures and lower headcount, offset somewhat by costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and technological infrastructure.
     For fiscal 2010, our operating income was $724.8 million, a decrease of 10% from the prior fiscal year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description) decreased 6% to $688.5 million for fiscal 2010 as compared to $729.7 million for fiscal 2009.
     For fiscal 2010, interest on funds held for clients decreased 27% to $55.0 million due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. Average investment balances for funds held for clients declined 5% for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year as a result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "economic stimulus package"), partially offset by the impact of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year. The economic stimulus package went into effect in April 2009, and its impact on year-over-year comparisons of average invested balances has abated in the fourth quarter. This factor, along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates, resulted in average invested balances for funds held for clients growing 3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.
     Investment income, net decreased 34% to $4.5 million. This was the result of lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations.
 
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     We continue to follow our investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. In the past twenty months, this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. All the investments we held as of May 31, 2010 are traded in active markets. Since September 2008, our primary short-term investment vehicle has been United States ("U.S.") agency discount notes. We have seen gradual improvements in liquidity in certain money market sectors, and in November 2009 we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $82.4 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $62.4 million as of June 18, 2010.
FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2010 HIGHLIGHTS
     Our year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter are better than the respective comparisons for the full fiscal year. Checks per client increased 1.1% for the fourth quarter compared to a decline of 2.6% for the full year fiscal 2010. Our retirement services client growth rebounded, ending the fiscal year up 3% compared to May 31, 2009, whereas as of February 28, 2010 it was flat year-over-year. Our average invested balances for funds held for clients increased 3% for the fourth quarter, compared to a 5% decline for the full fiscal year.
     Highlights of our fourth quarter financial results are as follows:
 
RAPID PAYROLL, INC. LITIGATION
     During the three months ended February 28, 2010, we recognized $18.7 million of additional expense related to the Rapid Payroll, Inc. ("Rapid Payroll") litigation that commenced in August 2001, and has been previously disclosed. On March 9, 2010, the Court of Appeal of the State of California upheld a jury verdict issued on June 27, 2007 in litigation brought by one of the licensees. In that case, the California Superior Court, Los Angeles County jury awarded to the plaintiff $15.0 million in compensatory damages and subsequently awarded an additional $11.0 million in punitive damages. Paychex satisfied the judgment, including statutory interest, without further appeal. This was the final pending matter in the Rapid Payroll litigation.
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We project that Payroll service revenue for fiscal 2011 will be flat compared to fiscal 2010. Human Resource Services revenue is anticipated to increase in the range of 10% to 13%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in the range of 12% to 17%, while investment income, net is expected to increase in the range of 24% to 27%.
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2011. Net income is expected to improve slightly over fiscal 2010. However, when the impact of the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is excluded from fiscal 2010, net income growth for fiscal 2011 is expected to be flat.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

Overview
     We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio. They are provided through either our core payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:
     In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service option through our MMS platform provides human resource management, employee benefits management, time and attendance systems, online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We mainly earn revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our business strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance by providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary services; leveraging our technological and operating infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.
     Our financial results for fiscal 2010 were impacted by the cumulative adverse effects of the economic recession in the U.S. and global financial crisis that began in 2008. Unemployment rates in the U.S. reached a high in October 2009, and have remained high. The equity markets reached a low in March 2009, with interest rates on high quality instruments remaining low since then. The Federal Funds rate has been at a range of zero to 0.25% since December 2008. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for fiscal 2010, compared to 2.1% for fiscal 2009 and 3.7% for fiscal 2008.
     The weak economy affects our ability to sell and retain clients, reduces our transaction volumes related to fewer employees in our client base, and results in lower average invested balances in our funds held for clients portfolio. Our results, while reflecting a decline compared to fiscal 2009, were in line with our expectations. Although the economy has remained weak throughout fiscal 2010, our key indicators reflected modest improvement as the fiscal year progressed.
 
     Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 are as follows:
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
     In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the SEC. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. Operating income, net of certain items, decreased 6% to $688.5 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $729.7 million for fiscal 2009 and $696.5 million for fiscal 2008.
Business Outlook
     Our client base was approximately 536,000 clients as of May 31, 2010, compared to approximately 554,000 clients as of May 31, 2009, and approximately 572,000 clients as of May 31, 2008. Our client base declined 3.2% for fiscal 2010, compared to a decline of 3.1% for fiscal 2009 and growth of 2.0% for fiscal 2008. The reduction in our client base for fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of weaker economic conditions on our ability to attract and retain clients. The environment for new sales remained difficult and new sales units decreased 4.9% for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of low levels of new business formation and fewer companies moving to outsourcing.
     Client retention was at 77% of our beginning of the year client base. While this was relatively consistent with the prior year, we have begun to see some signs of improvement, as clients lost in fiscal 2010 decreased 6% compared to fiscal 2009. Clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees decreased 11% for fiscal 2010, compared to an increase of 17% for fiscal 2009. We focus on satisfying customers to maximize client retention, and for fiscal 2010 we again received high client satisfaction results.
 
     Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. Although the growth rates for our ancillary services for fiscal 2010 were slower than we have seen historically due to the impacts of the weak economy, we continue to see opportunities within these services. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings:
 
     Continued investment in our business is critical to our success. In fiscal 2010, we made investments in our sales force and in our technological infrastructure. Our sales force increased 2% to 2,340 sales representatives for fiscal 2010, and is expected to grow 2% to 2,380 sales representatives for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"). This growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other Human Resource Services offerings.
     We have invested over $60 million in an enhanced platform for our core payroll processing capability, which was fully implemented in fiscal 2010. This new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients. Over the next few years, we expect to expand our enhanced platform to additional service offerings.
     We continued expansion of our insurance services nationwide, simplifying the process for our clients to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers. We see our insurance services as an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth.
     We also strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties. The new Paychex Insurance Agency website helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage. In addition, we provide information for existing and prospective clients on the impacts of regulatory changes, such as the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment ("HIRE") Act and the recently passed federal health care reform bill.
      Our Paychex Premier and PEO are being offered under Paychex HR Solutions. We integrated the sales and service model to support and expand our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services nationwide. This allowed us to eliminate redundancies, and create more flexible options for potential clients. PEO services will continue to be sold by the registered and licensed Paychex Business Solutions, Inc. and its affiliates.
     Looking to the future, we continue to focus on investing in our products, people, and service capabilities. This will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long term growth.
Financial position and liquidity
     The current credit crisis has resulted in unprecedented volatility in the global financial markets, which has curtailed available liquidity and limited investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2010, our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $656.9 million and no debt.
 
     We continue to follow our conservative investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. In the past twenty months, this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. Since September 2008, our primary short-term investment vehicle has been U.S. agency discount notes. However, we have seen gradual improvements in liquidity in certain money market sectors, and starting in November 2009 we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs"). During fiscal 2010, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.21% on VRDNs compared to approximately 0.07% for U.S. agency discount notes. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2010 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. All investments held as of May 31, 2010 are traded in active markets.
     Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $610.9 million for fiscal 2010. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments from our operating activities. Our positive cash flows in fiscal 2010 allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. During fiscal 2010, dividends paid to stockholders were 94% of net income. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2010, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, and our financial position as of May 31, 2010, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review and the discussion in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this review.
Outlook
     Our outlook for fiscal 2011 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We project that payroll service revenue for fiscal 2011 will be flat compared to fiscal 2010. Human Resource Services revenue is anticipated to increase in the range of 10% to 13%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decrease in the range of 12% to 17%, while investment income, net is expected to increase in the range of 24% to 27%.
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to range from 34% to 35% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2011. Net income is expected to improve slightly over fiscal 2010. However, when the impact of the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is excluded from fiscal 2010, net income growth for fiscal 2011 is expected to be flat.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2011 are expected to be impacted by the low-interest-rate environment. The average rate of return on our combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be 1.3% for fiscal 2011. As of May 31, 2010, the long-term investment portfolio had an average yield-to-maturity of 2.9% and an average duration of 2.5 years. In the next twelve months, slightly over 15% of this portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.0%. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations.
     Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our earnings from a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would be approximately $3.5 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.
     Purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2011 are expected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, as we continue to invest in our technological infrastructure. Fiscal 2011 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2011 to be approximately $20 million.
 
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2010, we had no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
 
     Payroll service revenue decreased 5% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2010 as a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic conditions on our client base and check volume. Our client base decreased 3.2% during fiscal 2010 and checks per client decreased 2.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Checks per client has shown modest improvement in each sequential quarter of fiscal 2010, reflecting year-over-year declines of 5.0%, 3.7%, and 2.2% for the first through third fiscal quarters, and an increase of 1.1% for the fourth quarter. At the end of fiscal 2010, checks per client were slightly higher than at the end of fiscal 2009. Payroll service revenue increased 1% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2009 due to our annual price increase and growth in utilization of our ancillary payroll services, offset by impacts of weak economic conditions. During fiscal 2009, our client base declined 3.1%, affected by a decline in new client sales from new business starts and clients lost due to companies going out of business or no longer having any employees. Checks per client declined 2.9% for fiscal 2009.
Payroll service revenue:
     Our payroll tax administration services were utilized by 94% of all our clients as of May 31, 2010, compared with 93% as of May 31, 2009 and 2008. Our employee payment services were utilized by 77% of our clients as of May 31, 2010, compared with 75% as of May 31, 2009 and 73% as of May 31, 2008. Nearly all new clients purchase our payroll tax administration services and more than 80% of new clients select a form of our employee payment services.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 3% for fiscal 2010 and 11% for fiscal 2009 to $540.9 million and $523.6 million, respectively. The following factors contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009:
Human Resource Services revenue:
 
      In addition, growth in products that are primarily beneficial to our MMS clients contributed positively to Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2010. Health and benefits service revenue increased 49% to $31.0 million for fiscal 2010 and increased 70% to $20.9 million for fiscal 2009.
     While the above factors contributed to the revenue growth in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 as compared to the respective prior year periods, the rates of growth have been adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base growth. This particularly affected retirement services, although we have seen client growth for retirement services rebound somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as client losses have improved compared to the prior year.
     Retirement services revenue growth was impacted in both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 by billings in fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients' retirement plans required by statute, which are not expected to recur for approximately six years. This favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 by $12.4 million and did not recur in fiscal 2010.
     In fiscal 2010, Human Resource Services revenue was also impacted by the sale of Stromberg time and attendance ("Stromberg"), an immaterial component of Paychex. Our Human Resource Services revenue growth, excluding Stromberg revenue and the retirement plan restatement billings, would have been as follows:
     In fiscal 2010, the 33% increase in the asset value of retirement services client employees' funds was driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to Paychex. For fiscal 2009, the volatility in the financial markets caused the asset value of retirement services client employees' funds to decline 12%. The S&P 500 declined 34% during the same period. For both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees' funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers.
 
     For fiscal 2009, the decline in asset value and the shift in client employees' retirement portfolios to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers reduced retirement services revenue growth by $8.9 million. Also for fiscal 2009, Paychex HR Solutions revenue growth was adversely impacted by fewer employees per client, decreasing revenue by $8.7 million.
     Total service revenue declined 3% for fiscal 2010 and increased 4% for fiscal 2009. The cumulative effect of the weak economy had a negative impact on service revenue growth as previously described.
Total service revenue:
     The decrease of 27% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities. The decrease of 43% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was the result of lower average interest rates earned, lower average investment balances, and lower net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities.
Interest on funds held for clients:
     Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased 5% for fiscal 2010 and 3% for fiscal 2009. These declines were the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "economic stimulus package"). In the second half of 2010, the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year. The economic stimulus package went into effect in April 2009, and its impact on year-over-year comparisons of average invested balances has abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This factor, along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates, resulted in average invested balances for funds held for clients growing 3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in fiscal 2009.
     Refer to the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review for more information on changing interest rates.
     The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for fiscal years:
Combined operating and SG&A expenses:
     During fiscal 2010, we recorded an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase our litigation reserve. Excluding the expense charge to increase the litigation reserve, combined operating and SG&A expenses decreased 2% for fiscal 2010 and increased 3% for fiscal 2009. The decline for fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and technological infrastructure. In fiscal 2010, we had a freeze on salary increases and made no matching contributions to our 401(k) plan. We reinstituted salary increases beginning March 1, 2010, but the freeze saved us approximately $15.0 million for 2010. No decision has been made on the reinstatement of the 401(k) match, although we have saved approximately $15.0 million for fiscal 2010 from its suspension. The increase for fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increases in personnel, though at a slower pace than prior years, and other costs related to selling and retaining clients and promoting new services. As of May 31, 2010, we had approximately 12,200 employees compared with approximately 12,500 employees as of May 31, 2009 and 12,200 employees as of May 31, 2008.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. The increase in amortization in fiscal 2009 was a result of intangibles from acquisitions and client list acquisitions. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business.
     Operating income declined 10% and 3% for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively. The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating income:
 
     Operating income, net of certain items, is as follows for fiscal years:
     Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" section on page 3.
     Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The decrease of 34% in investment income for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations. The decrease of 74% in investment income for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances attributed to funding the stock repurchase program, which was completed in December 2007.
Investment income, net:
     Our effective income tax rate was 34.6% for fiscal 2010, compared with 34.3% for fiscal 2009, and 32.6% for fiscal 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes. The increase in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of lower levels of tax-exempt income derived from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios.
Income taxes:
     Net income decreased 11% for fiscal 2010 and 7% for fiscal 2009 to $477.0 million and $533.5 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share decreased 11% for fiscal 2010 and 5% for fiscal 2009 to $1.32 per share and $1.48 per share, respectively. These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed. In particular, the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share for fiscal 2010. Combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal 2010 decreased 28% or $22.8 million, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.04 per share. For fiscal 2009, combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income decreased 48% or $76.0 million, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.14 per share. For fiscal 2009, diluted earnings per share decreased at a lower rate than net income due to a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding resulting from the stock repurchase program completed in December 2007.
Net income and earnings per share:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     The volatility in the global financial markets that began in September 2008 curtailed available liquidity and limited investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, our financial position as of May 31, 2010 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $656.9 million and no debt. We also believe that our investments as of May 31, 2010 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2010, along with projected operating cash flows, are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Commitments and Contractual Obligations
     As of May 31, 2010, we had unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted, secured, short-term lines of credit at market rates of interest with financial institutions as follows:
Lines of credit:
 
     Our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between Paychex, Inc. and each of the financial institutions (the "Lenders"), pursuant to which we have granted each of the Lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts. The collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the Lenders. Under certain circumstances, individual Lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual Lenders.
     The primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short-term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business, if necessary. No amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal 2010 or as of May 31, 2010.
     JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Bank of America, N.A. are also parties to our irrevocable standby letters of credit, which arrangements are discussed below.
     As of May 31, 2010, we had irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding totaling $50.3 million, required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies. The letters of credit expire at various dates between July 2010 and May 2011, and are collateralized by securities held in our investment portfolios. No amounts were outstanding on these letters of credit during fiscal 2010 or as of May 31, 2010.
Letters of credit:
     We have entered into various operating leases and purchase obligations that, under GAAP, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2010. The table below summarizes our estimated annual payment obligations under these commitments as of May 31, 2010:
Other commitments:
 
     The liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately $27.5 million as of May 31, 2010. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows and have excluded this liability from the table above. We are currently under a state income tax audit for the years ended May 31, 2004 through 2007. The examination phase of the audit is expected to conclude within the next twelve months; however, based on the current status of the examination, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact, if any, to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.
     Certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long-term liabilities amounting to $46.9 million are excluded from the table above because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments.
     Advantage Payroll Services Inc. ("Advantage") has license agreements with independently owned associate offices ("Associates"), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. Under these arrangements, Advantage pays the Associates commissions based on processing activity for the related clients. When we acquired Advantage, there were fifteen Associates. Over the past few years, some arrangements with various Associates have been discontinued, and there are currently fewer than ten Associates. Since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain, obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above. Commission expense for the Associates for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $9.9 million, $12.3 million, and $15.3 million, respectively.
 
     We guarantee performance of service on annual maintenance contracts for clients who financed their service contracts through a third party. In the normal course of business, we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients. Historically, there have been no material losses related to such guarantees. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, which require us to defend and, if necessary, indemnify these individuals for certain pending or future legal claims as they relate to their services provided to us.
     We currently self-insure the deductible portion of various insured exposures under certain employee benefit plans. Our estimated loss exposure under these insurance arrangements is recorded in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Historically, the amounts accrued have not been material. We also maintain insurance coverage in addition to our purchased primary insurance policies for gap coverage for employment practices liability, errors and omissions, warranty liability, and acts of terrorism; and capacity for deductibles and self-insured retentions through our captive insurance company.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities such as special purpose entities or structured finance entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. We do maintain investments as a limited partner in low-income housing projects that are not considered part of our ongoing operations. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are less than 1% of our total assets as of May 31, 2010.
Cash Flow Activities
     The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related primarily to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve, partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit. The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 was attributable to lower net income. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and intangible assets. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
     Funds held for clients consist of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
 
     The fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments. As a result of volatility in the financial market, in September 2008 we divested of any VRDN securities held and began to utilize U.S. agency discount notes as our primary short-term investment vehicle. U.S. agency discount notes are cash equivalents. VRDNs, although priced and traded as short-term securities, are classified as available-for-sale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities. As a result of the divestiture, the proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities exceeded the purchases of available-for-sale securities in fiscal 2009. Much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients portfolio. In November 2009, we began to again invest in select A-1/P-1-rated VRDNs, although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year. We utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these VRDNs, and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of available-for-sale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of available-for-sale securities. Also in fiscal 2010, more corporate funds have been invested in longer-term municipal bonds. There is a significant decline in net cash received from changes in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 related to proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities in fiscal 2008 that were not reinvested as part of the funding of the $1.0 billion stock repurchase program completed in December 2007.
     In general, fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Additional discussion of interest rates and related risks is included in the "Market Risk Factors" section of this review.
     To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, we purchased approximately $3.2 million, $4.5 million, and $4.4 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the "Board").
Purchases of long-lived assets:
     During fiscal 2010, we received $13.1 million from the sale of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company. During fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, we paid $6.4 million and $32.9 million, respectively, related to acquisitions of businesses. The acquisitions in fiscal 2008 related mainly to employee benefits products. The purchases of other assets were for customer lists.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. As a result of May 31, 2010 being a Federal holiday, client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on Friday, May 28, 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until June 2010. Also, in fiscal 2010 we have seen an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the 2010 calendar year.
Net change in client fund obligations:
     We repurchased 23.7 million shares of common stock for a total of $1.0 billion under our stock repurchase program completed in December 2007.
Repurchases of common stock:
     A quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. In July 2008, our Board approved a 3% increase in our quarterly dividend payment to $0.31 per share from $0.30 per share. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 94%, 84%, and 77% for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, respectively. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
 
     Proceeds from and excess tax benefit related to exercise of stock options decreased for fiscal 2010 and for fiscal 2009 as compared to the respective prior years. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 0.4 million shares for each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 and 2.0 million shares for fiscal 2008.
Exercise of stock options:
Critical Accounting Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, future expectations, and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates. Certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below.
     Service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period. Our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenue earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue, and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition:
     PEO revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred, which include wages, taxes, benefit premiums, and claims of PEO worksite employees. Direct costs billed and incurred were $3.1 billion for fiscal 2010 and $2.6 billion for both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.
     Revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized when all of the following are present: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, typically a non-cancelable sales order; delivery is complete for the software and hardware; the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions. Revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
     In certain situations we allow a client a right of return or refund. We maintain an allowance for returns, which is based on historical data. The allowance is reviewed periodically for adequacy with any adjustment to revenue reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified.
     Interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. These collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services. Interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available-for-sale securities.
     Workers' compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers' compensation insurance reserves, we use an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims.
PEO workers' compensation insurance:
     Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections, and is subject to change due to multiple factors, including economic trends, changes in legal liability law, and damage awards, all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.
 
     We regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers' compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
     Our maximum individual claims liability was $1.0 million under both the fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 policies. As of May 31, 2010 and 2009, we had recorded current liabilities of $5.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively, and long-term liabilities of $20.1 million and $17.9 million, respectively, for workers' compensation claims.
     Our investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. In determining the fair value of our available-for-sale securities, we utilize the Interactive Data Pricing Service, a market approach. Unrealized gains related to increases in the fair value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the fair value of investments are included in comprehensive income, net of tax. Changes in the fair value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security's cost basis. On our Consolidated Statements of Income, realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients, whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income, net.
Valuation of investments:
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment, and whether it is more-likely-than-not that we would be required to sell the investment prior to the earlier of market price recovery or maturity. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.
     We have $421.6 million and $433.3 million of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting from acquisitions of businesses. The decrease in goodwill was due to the divestiture in fiscal 2010 of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company.
Goodwill and other intangible assets:
     Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Our business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. We perform our annual review in our fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of our goodwill impairment review, no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009. Subsequent to this review, there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance.
     We also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
     All stock-based awards to employees, including grants of stock options, are recognized as compensation costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on their fair values measured as of the date of grant. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires various assumptions as inputs including expected volatility of the Paychex stock price and expected option life. We estimate volatility based on a combination of historical volatility using weekly stock prices and implied market volatility, both over a period equal to the expected option life. We estimate expected option life based on historical exercise behavior.
Stock-based compensation costs:
     We are required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest. Our assumptions for forfeitures were determined based on type of award and historical experience. Forfeiture assumptions are adjusted at the point in time a significant change is identified with any adjustment recorded in the period of change, and the final adjustment at the end of the requisite service period to equal actual forfeitures.
 
     The assumptions of volatility, expected option life, and forfeitures all require significant judgment and are subject to change in the future due to factors such as employee exercise behavior, stock price trends, and changes to type or provisions of stock-based awards. Any change in one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of an award and on stock-based compensation costs recognized in our results of operations.
     We have determined that the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as well as the underlying assumptions used in its application, is appropriate in estimating the fair value of stock option grants. We periodically reassess our assumptions as well as our choice of valuation model, and will reconsider use of this model if additional information becomes available in the future indicating that another model would provide a more accurate estimate of fair value, or if characteristics of future grants would warrant such a change.
     We account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record a deferred tax asset related to the stock-based compensation costs recognized for certain stock-based awards. At the time of exercise of non-qualified stock options or vesting of stock awards, we account for the resulting tax deduction by reducing our accrued income tax liability with an offset to the deferred tax asset and any excess tax benefit increasing additional paid-in capital. We currently have a sufficient pool of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital to absorb any deficient tax benefits related to stock-based awards. We also maintain a reserve for uncertain tax positions.
Income taxes:
Market Risk Factors
     Funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. As a result of our operating and investing activities, we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the fair value of our longer-term available-for-sale securities. We follow a conservative investment strategy of maximizing liquidity and protecting principal. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We manage the available-for-sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one-half to three years. All investments held as of May 31, 2010 are traded in active markets.
Changes in interest rates and interest rate risk:
     Since September 2008, our primary short-term investment vehicle has been U.S. agency discount notes. In September 2008, we sold all of our holdings of VRDNs and prime money market funds as a result of turmoil in the related markets. No losses were recognized on those sales. The proceeds from the sales of these investments were reinvested in U.S. agency discount notes. Since then, we have seen gradual improvement in liquidity in certain money market sectors, and beginning in November 2009 we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated VRDNs. During fiscal 2010, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.21% for VRDNs as compared to approximately 0.07% for U.S. agency discount notes. We have no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments such as auction rate securities, sub-prime mortgage securities, asset-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, collateralized debt obligations, enhanced cash or cash plus mutual funds, or structured investment vehicles (SIVs). We have not and do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk.
     During fiscal 2010, the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was 1.5%, compared with 2.1% for fiscal 2009 and 3.7% for fiscal 2008. With the turmoil in the financial markets, our conservative investment strategy has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments. When interest rates are falling, the full impact of lower interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of short- and long-term interest rate changes. During a falling interest rate environment, the decreases in interest rates decrease earnings from our short-term investments, and over time decrease earnings from our longer-term available-for-sale securities. Earnings from the available-for-sale-securities, which as of May 31, 2010 had an average duration of 2.5 years, would not reflect decreases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower rates. In the next twelve months, slightly over 15% of our available-for-sale portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.0%.
 
     The cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities that had stated maturities as of May 31, 2010 are shown below by contractual maturity. Expected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.
     VRDNs are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities are typically 20 to 30 years. Although these securities are issued as long-term securities, they are priced and traded as short-term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the tender feature.
     The following table summarizes the changes in the Federal Funds rate over the past three fiscal years:
 
     Calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:
     Subject to these factors, a 25-basis-point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax-exempt interest rates by approximately 17 basis points.
     Our total investment portfolio (funds held for clients and corporate investments) averaged approximately $3.8 billion for fiscal 2010. Our anticipated allocation is approximately 50% invested in short-term securities and available-for-sale securities with an average duration of less than 30 days, and 50% invested in available-for-sale securities with an average duration of two and one-half to three years.
     The combined funds held for clients and corporate available-for-sale securities reflected a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.7 million as of May 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, the net unrealized gain position on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.1 million to $82.4 million. During fiscal 2009, the investment portfolios ranged from a net unrealized loss of $15.2 million to a net unrealized gain of $86.6 million. The net unrealized gain of our investment portfolios was approximately $62.4 million as of June 18, 2010.
 
     As of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, we had $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, invested in available-for-sale securities at fair value. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity was 2.9% and 3.3% as of May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009, respectively. The weighted-average yield-to-maturity excludes available-for-sale securities tied to short-term interest rates such as the VRDNs held as of May 31, 2010. We held no VRDNs as of May 31, 2009. Assuming a hypothetical decrease in both short-term and longer-term interest rates of 25 basis points, the resulting potential increase in fair value for our portfolio of available-for-sale securities as of May 31, 2010, would be approximately $12.0 million. Conversely, a corresponding increase in interest rates would result in a comparable decrease in fair value. This hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio's recorded value, with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders' equity. These fluctuations in fair value would have no related or immediate impact on the results of operations, unless any declines in fair value were considered to be other-than-temporary and an impairment loss recognized.
     We are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds. We regularly review our investment portfolios to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns. We believe that the investments we held as of May 31, 2010 were not other-than-temporarily impaired. While $73.6 million of our available-for-sale securities had fair values that were below amortized cost, we believe that it is probable that the principal and interest will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms, and that the decline in the fair value to $0.4 million below amortized cost was due to changes in interest rates and was not due to increased credit risk or other valuation concerns. All of the securities with an unrealized loss as of May 31, 2010 and the majority of the securities with an unrealized loss as of May 31, 2009 held an AA rating or better. We intend to hold these investments until the recovery of their amortized cost basis or maturity and further believe that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to that time. Our assessment that an investment is not other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular investment.

EXHIBIT 99.1
September 27, 2010
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, September 27, 2010  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $518.3 million for the three months ended August 31, 2010 (the "first quarter"), an increase of 4% from $500.2 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 7% to $131.9 million and diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $0.36 per share.
     B. Thomas Golisano, Chairman of the Board of Directors, commented, "Our first quarter was slightly better than expected. Our client retention has improved. Sales of new units continue to be difficult, but we are implementing changes to our sales process that should enable us to improve sales productivity in the near future. Our first quarter results are encouraging; however, we remain cautious on fiscal 2011. We will monitor how the year evolves before determining any changes to our June 2010 guidance."
     Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $360.7 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Positively contributing to payroll service revenue was an increase in checks per client of 1.2% for the first quarter and annual price increases. Client retention reflected improvement, as client losses decreased 12% for the first quarter compared to the prior year period. New client sales were down slightly for the first quarter compared to the same period last year.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% to $145.5 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Human Resource Services revenue growth was impacted by the sale of Stromberg time and attendance operations ("Stromberg") in October 2009. Excluding Stromberg, Human Resource Services revenue would have increased 13% for the first quarter. This growth was generated from the following:
     Human Resource Services revenue growth reflects modest improvements in economic conditions and annual price increases. The asset value of retirement services client employees' funds increased 20% as a result of recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to Paychex. This positive contribution to revenue was offset somewhat by the impact of a shift in the mix of assets to investments earning lower fees from investment managers. In addition, Paychex HR Solutions revenue was positively impacted by increases in clients and client employees and the related checks per client for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely attributable to the nationwide expansion of our professional employer organization. Health and benefits services
 
revenue increased 41% for the first quarter, driven primarily by a 35% increase in the number of applicants. Growth in certain products that primarily support our Major Market Services clients has also positively contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth.
     Total expenses increased 2% to $317.5 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and technological infrastructure. Improvements in productivity within operations with related lower headcount have offset this increase somewhat. Sales representatives are in line with our expected growth of 2% for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"). We continue to closely manage expenses, as reflected in the increase in operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue to 37.3% for the first quarter from 36.2% for the same period last year.
     For the first quarter, our operating income was $200.8 million, an increase of 6% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) increased 7% to $188.7 million for the first quarter as compared to $176.2 million for the same period last year.
     Interest on funds held for clients decreased 12% to $12.1 million for the first quarter due to lower average interest rates earned, offset slightly by a 1% increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was due to an increase in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year, offset by lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base. Investment income, net increased 57% to $1.4 million for the first quarter. This increase was the result of higher average investment balances resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations, and slightly higher average interest rates earned. The increase in average interest rates earned for corporate investments resulted from the allocation of funds from short-term to higher-rate longer-term investments late in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010").
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
Page 2 of 7
 
     We continue to follow our conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Over the past two years, this has translated to significantly lower yields on high quality instruments, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We invest predominantly in municipal bonds  general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a United States ("U.S.") government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. All the investments we held as of August 31, 2010 are traded in active markets. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, our primary short-term investment vehicle was U.S. agency discount notes. Starting in November 2009, we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs"). We have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $605.6 million as of August 31, 2010, up from $226.3 million as of May 31, 2010. During the first quarter, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.22% on VRDNs compared to approximately 0.08% on U.S. agency discount notes.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $85.1 million as of August 31, 2010, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010. During the first quarter, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $62.4 million to $86.2 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $77.3 million as of September 22, 2010.
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for fiscal 2011 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Although our first quarter results were slightly better than anticipated, we remain cautiously optimistic about the economic recovery and will watch how fiscal 2011 evolves before determining if we should revise the fiscal 2011 guidance issued in June 2010. Our guidance at that time was as follows:
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

"We are excited to have SurePayroll join the Paychex family," says Martin Mucci, Paychex president and CEO. "This acquisition helps Paychex expand further into a new segment of the online market for small business - a fast-growing part of the market that we believe will continue to thrive."
Converting businesses that today do their payroll manually to a full-service Paychex payroll product or a self-service, online solution represents a significant growth opportunity for Paychex, as there are millions of businesses in the U.S. with fewer than five employees each currently doing their payroll manually.
"As some small businesses get more comfortable doing business online, and as they demand more control, convenience, and online product functionality, we believe the new manual' method of doing payroll will be the online model Paychex can now offer through SurePayroll," Mucci says. "We have the full range of alternatives, depending on the level of interaction a customer wants. For those who prefer more control, the SurePayroll model provides that. For those customers who want a high level of personal interaction with a dedicated payroll specialist, we offer that, too. Quality customer service is a fundamental part of Paychex and SurePayroll, and always will be."
"We are excited for our customers, channel partners, employees, and small businesses everywhere. This is a great combination of strengths," says Michael D. Alter, SurePayroll president. "SurePayroll is the leader in SaaS-delivered payroll for small business, and Paychex is an experienced leader in the outsourcing of payroll, human resources, and benefits. With the help of Paychex's resources, SurePayroll will continue building upon and accelerate our leadership position in the self-service, SaaS payroll space."
 
In addition to marketing its SaaS-based product suite directly to small businesses, SurePayroll has a leading position with a variety of channel partners, including some of the nation's foremost banking institutions, such as Citibank, Harris Bank, and SunTrust Bank. The financial institutions provide the SurePayroll offerings to their small business customers through private-label and referral agreements.
"The bank channel is very important to Paychex, and it represents another area of significant growth opportunity for us. Paychex values SurePayroll's relationships, and they will remain in place," Mucci says.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2010 and is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. SurePayroll will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex. Michael Alter will continue to serve as president of SurePayroll.

EXHIBIT 99.1
December 20, 2010
SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, December 20, 2010 - Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $512.0 million for the three months ended November 30, 2010 (the "second quarter"), a 3% increase from $496.6 million for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $133.9 million and $0.37 per share, respectively.
     Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased with our second quarter results. Checks per client, revenue per check, and client retention have all continued to improve. Our favorable second quarter results were a continuation of the first quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2011 has improved accordingly."
     Payroll service revenue increased 1% to $354.8 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. Positively contributing to payroll service revenue was an increase in checks per client of 2.5% for the second quarter and our annual price increase. Our payroll client base as of November 30, 2010 is 2.2% lower than November 30, 2009, with all of the decrease occurring in the last half of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2010.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% to $145.2 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Human Resource Services revenue growth was impacted by the sale of Stromberg time and attendance operations ("Stromberg") in October 2009. Excluding Stromberg, Human Resource Services revenue would have increased 11% for the second quarter. This growth was generated from the following:
 
     Human Resource Services revenue growth reflects modest improvements in economic conditions, the client growth noted above, and our annual price increase. Our Paychex HR Solutions revenue has been positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees and the related checks per client for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely attributable to the nationwide expansion of our professional employer organization ("PEO"). Health and benefits services revenue increased 29% to $10.1 million for the second quarter, driven primarily by a 29% increase in the number of applicants as of November 30, 2010 compared to November 30, 2009. In addition, growth in certain products that primarily support our Major Market Services clients has positively contributed to Human Resource Services revenue growth. The revenue growth from these factors was offset somewhat by fluctuations in PEO workers' compensation, which have negatively impacted PEO net service revenue.
 
     Total expenses increased 1% to $308.1 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and technological infrastructure. Improvements in productivity within operations with related lower headcount have somewhat offset this increase. Sales representative headcount is at the level expected going into our main selling season. We continue to closely manage expenses, allowing our operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description of this non-GAAP measure), to increase 7% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. It is anticipated that expenses will be higher in the second half of the fiscal year ending May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"). Contributing to that increase will be the reinstatement of an employer match on our 401(k) Incentive Retirement Plan beginning in January 2011.
     For the second quarter, our operating income was $203.9 million, an increase of 6% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 7% to $191.9 million for the second quarter as compared to $179.5 million for the same period last year.
     For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 12% to $12.0 million due to lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by a 3% increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was due to an increase in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year and the increase in checks per client, offset somewhat by lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base. Investment income, net increased 34% to $1.5 million for the second quarter. This increase was primarily the result of higher average investment balances resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
Page 2 of 8
 
     We continue to follow our conservative investment strategy of optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We invest predominantly in municipal bonds - general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a United States ("U.S.") government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. Starting in November 2009, we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") and we have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $700.0 million as of November 30, 2010, up from $226.3 million as of May 31, 2010. During the second quarter, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.25% on VRDNs compared to approximately 0.08% on U.S. agency discount notes, which are our primary short-term investment vehicle.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $61.4 million as of November 30, 2010, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010. During the six months ended November 30, 2010, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $56.6 million to $86.2 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $49.1 million as of December 15, 2010.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2010 are as follows:
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for fiscal 2011 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Our guidance is consistent with the net income trends for the years ending May 31, 2007 through 2010, when net income for the second half of the fiscal year was slightly less than the first half of the fiscal year. This relates primarily to the timing of price increases and additions to our sales force, the year end payroll processing occurring in our third fiscal quarter, and higher levels of selling expense in the second half of the fiscal year. On December 9, 2010, we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") for approximately $115.0 million. Revenue for SurePayroll for calendar year 2010 is expected to be approximately $23.0 million. Our fiscal 2011 guidance does not reflect any anticipated results from SurePayroll as the anticipated revenue impact is less than 1% and the anticipated earnings dilution is expected to be approximately $.01 per share due to amortization on acquired intangible assets and one-time acquisition costs. Our fiscal 2011 guidance is as follows:
Page 3 of 8
 
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2011 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. As investments in our long-term portfolio mature, the proceeds are being reinvested at lower average interest rates. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations.
     Operating income, net of certain items, is expected to increase at a rate similar to the first half of fiscal 2011. Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to be approximately 36% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2011.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, March 23, 2011  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $531.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011 (the "third quarter"), a 5% increase from $507.8 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 17% to $130.6 million and diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.36 per share. Our results for the prior year third quarter ended February 28, 2010, were impacted by an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share.
     Commenting on our results, Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased that the favorable results we saw during the first half of the fiscal year have continued during our third quarter. Checks per client have continued to improve, and we experienced double-digit growth in our clients' calendar year-end bonus activity compared to last year. In the third quarter, sales of new units were close to the prior year as new business starts continue to lag the economic recovery."
     Mr. Mucci added, "On February 8, 2011, we completed the acquisition of SurePayroll, Inc. for approximately $115 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition allows us entry into a new area of the payroll online market  one that we believe is well-positioned for growth."
     Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $366.4 million for the third quarter from the same period last year, primarily resulting from the improvement in checks per client. Human Resource Services revenue increased 13% to $153.2 million for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The growth in Human Resource Services revenue was generated from the following:
 
     Human Resource Services revenue growth reflects modest improvements in economic conditions, the client growth noted above, and our annual price increase. Paychex HR Solutions third quarter revenue was positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees. Contributing to this growth in the clients and client employees is our new product offering, Paychex HR Essentials, which provides support to our clients online or over the phone to help manage employee-related topics. Human Resource Services revenue was also positively impacted by growth in certain products that primarily support our Major Market Services clients. Health and benefits services revenue increased 27% to $10.5 million for the third quarter, driven primarily by a 26% increase in the number of applicants as of February 28, 2011 compared to February 28, 2010.
 
     Total expenses decreased 2% to $332.4 million for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. During the third quarter last year, an expense charge of $18.7 million was recognized to increase the litigation reserve. Excluding this expense charge, total expenses would have increased 4%. This increase was primarily due to costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and technological infrastructure. Improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have somewhat offset this increase.
     For the third quarter, our operating income was $198.9 million, an increase of 18% from the same period last year. We continue to closely manage expenses, allowing our operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) to increase 8% for the third quarter compared to the same period last year.
     For the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased 16% to $11.7 million due to lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by a 6% increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was due to increases in state unemployment insurance rates for calendar year 2011 and the increase in checks per client, offset somewhat by lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base. Investment income, net increased 25% to $1.5 million for the third quarter. This increase was primarily the result of higher average investment balances resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations, and a slight increase in average interest rates earned. The increase in the average interest rates earned on corporate investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer-term investment portfolio compared to the prior year.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
     We continue to follow an investment strategy that focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We invest predominantly in municipal bonds  general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a United States ("U.S.") government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. Starting in November 2009, we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") and we have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $699.9 million as of February 28, 2011, up from $226.3 million as of May 31, 2010. During the third quarter, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.26% on VRDNs compared to approximately 0.06% on U.S. agency discount notes, which are our primary short-term investment vehicle.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $46.4 million as of February 28, 2011, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010. During the nine months ended February 28, 2011, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $41.4 million to $86.2 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $50.6 million as of March 18, 2011.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     The highlights for the nine months ended February 28, 2011 are as follows:
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for fiscal 2011 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. On February 8, 2011, we completed the acquisition of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") for approximately $115 million, net of cash acquired. Revenue for SurePayroll for calendar year 2010 was approximately $23.0 million. Our fiscal 2011 guidance reflects anticipated results from SurePayroll subsequent to the acquisition. The anticipated revenue impact is less than 1% and the earnings dilution is expected to be less than $0.01 per share partly due to amortization on acquired intangible assets. Our fiscal 2011 guidance is as follows:
     In recent years, fourth quarter financial results have been lower than each of the first three quarters as it is the lowest quarter for service revenue during the fiscal year. We expect that trend to continue in fiscal 2011 for both service revenue and operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue.
     Human Resource Services revenue growth for the fourth quarter will be less than experienced for the first nine months due to fluctuations in revenue growth from our professional employer organization ("PEO"). PEO net service revenue is not as predictive as our other revenue streams and also tends to vary more quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees served and in workers' compensation revenue.
 
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income are being impacted by the low interest rate environment. As investments in our long-term portfolio mature, the proceeds are being reinvested at lower average interest rates. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations. Combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net are expected to decrease approximately 8% for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2012.
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to be approximately 36% for fiscal 2011. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2011.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

EXHIBIT 99.1
June 22, 2011
FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     ROCHESTER, NY, June 22, 2011  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $2.1 billion for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"), a 4% increase from $2.0 billion for the prior fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 ("fiscal 2010"). Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $515.3 million and $1.42 per share, respectively. Our results for fiscal 2010 were impacted by an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase the litigation reserve, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share. The acquisition of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") as of February 8, 2011 was dilutive to fiscal 2011 by less than $0.01 per share.
     Commenting on our results, Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased with our favorable results for fiscal 2011. Many of our key business indicators improved during the year. Most significantly, checks per client increased 2.1%, payroll services client retention improved two percentage points, and while the sales environment is still challenging, we have seen improvement in the latter half of the fiscal year in our core payroll sales. We increased our investment in product development, reached the highest levels of client satisfaction in our history, and acquired two software-as-a-service companies, SurePayroll and ePlan, to bolster our future growth."
     Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2011, primarily benefiting from the improvement in checks per client and revenue per check. Checks per client increased 2.1% for fiscal 2011 compared to a decrease of 2.6% for fiscal 2010. Revenue per check was positively impacted by lower discounting within our overall client base and price increases. As of May 31, 2011, we served approximately 564,000 clients, an increase of 5.2% from May 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of clients obtained from business acquisitions, our client base would have decreased 0.9%. This decrease is primarily attributable to the adverse impact on the sales of new units from lack of growth in new business starts. Client retention improved for fiscal 2011 with client losses that were 9% lower than for fiscal 2010, largely a result of fewer clients going out of business or having no employees.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% to $597.4 million for fiscal 2011. The growth in Human Resource Services revenue for fiscal 2011 was impacted by the revenue earned from Stromberg time and attendance operations ("Stromberg") for fiscal 2010 prior to its sale in October 2009. Excluding Stromberg, Human Resource Services revenue would have increased 12% for fiscal 2011.
 
     This growth was generated from the following:
 
     Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2011 reflects modest improvements in economic conditions, the client growth noted above, and price increases. Paychex HR Solutions revenue for fiscal 2011 was positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees. Contributing to this growth in the clients and client employees is our new product offering, Paychex HR Essentials, which provides support to our clients online or over the phone to help manage employee-related topics. Human Resource Services revenue was also positively impacted by growth in certain products that primarily support our Major Market Services clients. Also, insurance services revenue continued to grow as a result of increases in both health and benefits services and workers' compensation insurance services revenue. Health and benefits services revenue continued its accelerated growth since inception, increasing 29% to $42.0 million for fiscal 2011, driven primarily by the number of applicants.
     Total expenses increased 2% to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. During the third quarter last year, an expense charge of $18.7 million was recognized to increase the litigation reserve. Excluding this expense charge, total expenses would have increased 3%. This increase was primarily driven by personnel-related costs. In addition, we continue to invest in our product development and the supporting technology. Improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have somewhat offset this increase.
     For fiscal 2011, our operating income was $786.4 million, an increase of 8% from fiscal 2010. We continue to closely manage expenses, generating an increase in operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) of 7% for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
     For fiscal 2011, interest on funds held for clients decreased 13% to $48.1 million due to lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by a 6% increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2011 calendar year and the increase in checks per client, offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base.
 
     Investment income, net increased 29% to $5.8 million for fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily the result of higher average investment balances, and a slight increase in average interest rates earned. Average investment balances for corporate investments increased 1% for fiscal 2011 as a result of investment of cash generated from operations. This was offset by cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan during the second half of fiscal 2011, which resulted in a decline in average investment balances during the three months ended May 31, 2011 (the "fourth quarter"). The increase in the average interest rates earned on corporate investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer-term investment portfolio compared to the prior year.
     Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
     Our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality financial instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We invest predominantly in municipal bonds  general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a United States ("U.S.") government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. Starting in November 2009, we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") and we have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $828.3 million as of May 31, 2011, up from $226.3 million as of May 31, 2010. During fiscal 2011, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.23% on VRDNs compared to approximately 0.06% on U.S. agency discount notes, which have been our primary short-term investment vehicle.
     The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million as of May 31, 2011, compared with a net unrealized gain of $66.6 million as of May 31, 2010. During fiscal 2011, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $41.4 million to $86.2 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $59.4 million as of June 17, 2011.
FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
     Payroll service revenue growth was higher for the fourth quarter compared to the full year growth as a result of revenue from SurePayroll, which was acquired in February 2011. Excluding SurePayroll, payroll service revenue would have increased 3% for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year.
     The acquisition of ePlan during the fourth quarter positively impacted Human Resource Services growth. Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Services revenue would have increased 8% for the fourth quarter. This growth rate was less than experienced in the first nine months due to fluctuations in revenue growth from our professional employer organization ("PEO"). PEO net service revenue is more variable quarter to quarter than our other revenue streams due to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees as healthcare rates change.
     Total expenses for the fourth quarter were impacted by the expenses of the newly acquired entities, which are included in our financial results since their dates of acquisition.
 
     The highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows:
OUTLOOK
     Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects anticipated results for SurePayroll and ePlan. The anticipated service revenue impact is approximately 2% and the earnings dilution is expected to be approximately $0.01 per share, mainly due to amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our fiscal 2012 guidance is as follows:
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to be in the range of 35% to 36% for fiscal 2012. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2012.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment. As investments in our long-term portfolio mature, the proceeds are being reinvested at lower average interest rates. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations. Combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net are expected to decrease approximately 11% for fiscal 2012.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

Overview
     We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio. They are provided through either our core payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:
     In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service option through our MMS platform provides human resource management, employee benefits management, time and attendance systems, online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.
     Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
     We earn revenue mainly through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services. We also earn interest on funds held for clients between the time of collection from our clients and remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees. Our business strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance by providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary services; leveraging our technology and operating infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings.
     Our financial results for fiscal 2011 reflected year-over-year growth. We continued to see improvement in many of our key business indicators, especially in checks per client. Checks per client increased 2.1% for fiscal 2011, compared to a decline of 2.6% for fiscal 2010. Checks per client began to show year-over-year growth in the three months ending May 31, 2010 with 1.1% growth for that quarter and continued to improve throughout the year, reflecting increases of 1.2%, 2.5%, 2.8%, and 2.0% for each of the sequential quarters of fiscal 2011. Our revenue growth has been modest, as new sales units were relatively flat compared to the prior year largely due to lack of growth in new business starts.
     Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment. The equity markets hit a low in March 2009, with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time. The Federal Funds rate has been at a range of zero to 0.25% since December 2008. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for fiscal 2011, compared to 1.5% for fiscal 2010 and 2.1% for fiscal 2009.
 
     We continue to manage our headcount and expenses while investing in our business, particularly in areas related to selling and servicing our clients, product development, and the technology required to support these areas. We believe these investments are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we continue to focus on investing in our products, people, and service capabilities, positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth.
     Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows:
     During fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisition of two software-as-a-service companies, opening up additional areas of the markets we serve. SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll"), a provider of payroll processing for small businesses was acquired on February 8, 2011 for $114.9 million, net of cash acquired. SurePayroll serves small businesses with its easy-to-use, online payroll product and mobile application. This acquisition allows us entry into a new area of the online payroll market, and provides our clients with a mobile self-service alternative. The acquisition of SurePayroll was dilutive to fiscal 2011 by less than $0.01 per share. ePlan Services, Inc. ("ePlan"), a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace, was acquired on May 3, 2011 for $15.2 million, net of cash acquired. Both entities now operate as wholly owned subsidiaries of Paychex. Our financial results include the results of these entities from their respective dates of acquisition. Neither acquisition is significant to our consolidated financial statements.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
     In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the SEC. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 7% to $738.3 million for fiscal 2011 compared to $688.5 million for fiscal 2010 and $729.7 million for fiscal 2009.
Business Outlook
     Our client base was approximately 564,000 clients as of May 31, 2011, compared to approximately 536,000 clients as of May 31, 2010, and approximately 554,000 clients as of May 31, 2009. Our client base increased 5.2% for fiscal 2011, compared to declines of 3.2% for fiscal 2010 and 3.1% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the impact of the 33,000 SurePayroll clients, our client base would have declined 0.9% for fiscal 2011. This reduction reflects the impact of lack of growth in new business starts on our client base, as our new sales units were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2010. On a positive note, our sales to clients who previously utilized the services of local and regional competitors improved for fiscal 2011.
     For fiscal 2011, payroll services client retention was approximately 79% of our beginning fiscal year client base, a two percentage point improvement over the prior year, as clients lost decreased 9% for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease in client losses was largely attributable to fewer clients going out of business or having no employees for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. In addition, we lost fewer clients to local and regional competitors for fiscal 2011. Through our focus on providing high-quality service to our customers to maximize client retention, we received the highest client satisfaction results in the past several years.
     Ancillary services effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our ancillary service offerings:
 
     Continued investment in our business is critical to our success. In fiscal 2011, we made investments in our sales force and product development. Our sales force increased 2% to 2,380 sales representatives for fiscal 2011, and is expected to grow 1% to 2,400 sales representatives for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012"). This growth is driven primarily by increases in insurance services and other Human Resource Services offerings.
     We have continued to expand our enhanced payroll processing platform to include additional service offerings. This new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients. Our
 
enhanced platform has led to improved productivity within our operations, contributing to the increase in our operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue to 36.3% for fiscal 2011, compared to 35.4% for the prior year.
     Over the next few years, we will continue to invest in our product development, as we believe it is critical to our success. We have introduced new product offerings to add value for our clients. In fiscal 2011, we introduced Paychex HR Essentials, a new ASO offering that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-related topics. We also introduced Paychex SmartTimetime clocks for small businesses. This self-contained system offers small businesses an economical, easy-to-use time and attendance solution that automatically collects and calculates employee hours, and integrates with Paychex payroll.
TM
     We continued expansion of our insurance services nationwide, simplifying the process required to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers. We now service over 100,000 clients through our subsidiary, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. We believe insurance services is an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth.
     We strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. In addition, the Paychex Insurance Agency website, www.paychexinsurance.com, helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage.
     Looking to the future, we continue to focus on investing in our products, people, and service capabilities. This will position us to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth.
Financial position and liquidity
     The volatility in the global financial markets that began in September 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2011, our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $671.3 million and no debt.
     Our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality financial instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest predominately in municipal bonds  general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. Our primary short-term investment vehicle has been U.S. agency discount notes. Starting in November 2009, we began to invest in select A-1/P-1-rated variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") and have gradually increased our investment in VRDNs to $828.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During fiscal 2011, we earned an after-tax rate of approximately 0.23% for VRDNs compared to approximately 0.06% for U.S. agency discount notes.
     We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2011 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. All investments held as of May 31, 2011 were traded in active markets.
     Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $715.3 million for fiscal 2011. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, and dividend payments from our operating activities. Our positive cash flows in fiscal 2011 allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. During fiscal 2011, dividends paid to stockholders were 87% of net income. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2011, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
     For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, and our financial position as of May 31, 2011, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this review.
 
Outlook
     Our outlook for fiscal 2012 is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Our fiscal 2012 guidance reflects anticipated results for SurePayroll and ePlan. The anticipated service revenue impact is approximately 2% and the earnings dilution is expected to be approximately $0.01 per share, mainly due to amortization of acquired intangible assets. Our fiscal 2012 guidance is as follows:
     Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue is expected to be in the range of 35% to 36% for fiscal 2012. The effective income tax rate is expected to approximate 35% for fiscal 2012.
     Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment. The average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to be 1.2% for fiscal 2012. As of May 31, 2011, the long-term investment portfolio had an average yield-to-maturity of 2.6% and an average duration of 2.4 years. In the next twelve months, slightly more than 20% of this portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.0%. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations, though at a lower growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal 2011 for business acquisitions.
     Under normal financial market conditions, the impact to our earnings from a 25-basis-point increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would be in the range of $3.5 million to $4.0 million, after taxes, for a twelve-month period. Such a basis point change may or may not be tied to changes in the Federal Funds rate.
     Purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2012 are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million. This includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our product development. Fiscal 2012 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. Intangible assets acquired from SurePayroll and ePlan are expected to increase amortization expense for fiscal 2012, partially offset by the impact of fully amortized intangibles.
 
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
     We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2011, we had no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
 
     Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2011, compared to a 5% decline for fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 revenue benefited from an increase in checks per client and revenue per check. Checks per client increased 2.1% for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue per check was positively impacted by lower discounting within our overall client base and price increases. Our client base, excluding the impact of SurePayroll, declined 0.9% during fiscal 2011. This was largely attributable to the adverse impact on the sales of new units from lack of growth in new business starts. Client retention improved for fiscal 2011, with client losses that were 9% lower than for fiscal 2010, largely a result of fewer clients going out of business or having no employees. In addition, fiscal 2011 new sales units and client losses related to local and regional competitors improved compared to the prior year.
Payroll service revenue:
     The decrease in payroll service revenue for fiscal 2010 was a result of the cumulative adverse effects of weak economic conditions on our client base and check volume. Our client base decreased 3.2% during fiscal 2010 and checks per client decreased 2.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
     Human Resource Services revenue increased 10% for fiscal 2011 and 3% for fiscal 2010 to $597.4 million and $540.9 million, respectively. Human Resource Services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 was impacted by the revenue earned from Stromberg time and attendance operations ("Stromberg"), an immaterial component of Paychex, prior to its sale in October 2009. In addition, retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2010 was impacted by billings in fiscal 2009 related to restatements of clients' retirement plans required by statute, which are not expected to recur for approximately six years. This favorably impacted retirement services revenue growth for fiscal 2009 by $12.4 million and did not recur in fiscal 2010. Excluding the impact of Stromberg in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, and the impact of retirement plan restatement billings for fiscal 2010, Human Resource Services revenue growth would have been as follows:
Human Resource Services revenue:
     This growth was generated from the following:
 
     Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2011 reflects modest improvements in economic conditions, the client growth noted above, and price increases. Paychex HR Solutions revenue for fiscal 2011 was positively impacted by increases in both clients and client employees. Contributing to this growth in the clients and client employees is our new product offering, Paychex HR Essentials. Growth in certain products that are primarily beneficial to our MMS clients contributed positively to Human Resource Services revenue growth for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. Also, insurance services revenue continued to grow as a result of increases in both health and benefits services and workers' compensation insurance services revenue. Health and benefits services revenue continued its accelerated growth since inception, increasing 29% for fiscal 2011 and 49% for fiscal 2010, driven primarily by the number of applicants.
     Somewhat offsetting these positive factors, fluctuations in our PEO revenue had an adverse impact on Human Resource Services revenue growth for fiscal 2011. PEO net service revenue is more variable quarter to quarter than our other revenue streams due to fluctuations in adding and retaining client employees as healthcare rates change.
 
     For fiscal 2010, client growth as noted above positively impacted Human Resource Services Revenue; however, the rates of growth were adversely affected by the cumulative impact of weak economic conditions on our client base. This particularly affected retirement services, although client growth for retirement services rebounded somewhat late in fiscal 2010 as client losses improved compared to the prior year.
     In fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, the 35% and 33% increases in the asset value of retirement services client employees' funds were driven by recovery in the financial markets and increased levels of larger plans converting to Paychex. For both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, retirement services revenue growth was adversely impacted by a shift in the mix of assets in the retirement services client employees' funds to investments earning lower fees from external fund managers.
     Total service revenue increased 5% for fiscal 2011 and declined 3% for fiscal 2010, attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Total service revenue:
     The decrease of 13% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of lower average interest rates earned, offset somewhat by an increase in average investment balances. The decrease of 27% in interest on funds held for clients for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances, offset somewhat by higher net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities.
Interest on funds held for clients:
     Average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 6% for fiscal 2011 and decreased 5% for fiscal 2010. The increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2011 calendar year and the increase in checks per client, offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base. The decline in average investment balances for fiscal 2010 was the result of the cumulative adverse effect of weak economic conditions on our client base and lower tax withholdings for client employees resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "economic stimulus package"). In the second half of fiscal 2010, the impact of these factors was partially offset by increases in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2010 calendar year. The economic stimulus package went into effect in April 2009, and its impact on year-over-year comparisons of average invested balances had abated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. This factor, along with the increases in state unemployment insurance rates, resulted in average invested balances for funds held for clients growing 3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in fiscal 2009.
     The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for fiscal years:
Combined operating and SG&A expenses:
     During fiscal 2010, we recorded an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase our litigation reserve. Excluding this expense charge, combined operating and SG&A expenses increased 3% for fiscal 2011 and decreased 2% for fiscal 2010. The increase for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by personnel-related costs, in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and 401(k) match as indicated below. In addition, we continued to invest in our product development and supporting technology. Improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have somewhat offset this increase. Fiscal 2011 compensation-related expenses include one-time costs related to the separation agreement entered into during the three months ended August 31, 2010 with Jonathan J. Judge, our former President and Chief Executive Officer. Growth in operating and SG&A expenses was higher for the full year fiscal 2011 than for the first nine months, mainly due to the expenses of SurePayroll and ePlan, which are included in our results since their respective acquisition dates.
     The decline in combined operating and SG&A expenses for fiscal 2010 was generated from cost control measures and lower headcount, offset slightly by costs related to continued investment in our sales force, customer service, and product development and supporting technology. In fiscal 2010, we saved approximately $30.0 million from a freeze on salary increases and providing no matching contributions to our 401(k) plan. We reinstituted salary increases beginning March 1, 2010 and reinstated a 401(k)
 
match effective January 1, 2011. As of May 31, 2011, we had approximately 12,400 employees compared with approximately 12,200 employees as of May 31, 2010 and 12,500 employees as of May 31, 2009.
     Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2011 due to the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan. Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business. The increase in other expenses for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the largely fourth quarter impact from our two acquisitions.
     Operating income increased 8% for fiscal 2011 and declined 10% for fiscal 2010. The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating income:
     Operating income, net of certain items, is as follows for fiscal years:
     Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" section of this review.
     Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The increase of 29% in investment income for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was the result of higher average invested balances and a slight increase in average interest rates earned. The 1% increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of investment of cash generated from operations, partially offset by cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan during the second half of fiscal 2011. The increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer-term investment portfolio compared to the prior year. The decrease of 34% in investment income for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was the result of lower average interest rates earned offset somewhat by higher average investment balances resulting from investment of cash generated from operations.
Investment income, net:
     Our effective income tax rate was 35.0% for fiscal 2011, compared with 34.6% for fiscal 2010, and 34.3% for fiscal 2009. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to lower tax-exempt income on available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. The increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of higher state income tax rates from state legislative changes.
Income taxes:
     Net income increased 8% to $515.3 million for fiscal 2011 and decreased 11% to $477.0 million for fiscal 2010. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to 1.42 per share for fiscal 2011 and decreased 11% to $1.32 per share for fiscal 2010. These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed. In particular, the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.03 per share for fiscal 2010. Combined interest on funds held for clients and corporate investment income for fiscal 2010 decreased 28% or $22.8 million, reducing diluted earnings per share by $0.04 per share.
Net income and earnings per share:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     The volatility in the global financial markets that began in September 2008 continues to curtail available liquidity and limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, our financial position as of May 31, 2011 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $671.3 million and no debt. We also believe that our investments as of May 31, 2011 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. We anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2011, along with projected operating
 
cash flows, are expected to support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
     The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 resulted mainly from an increase in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 related primarily to lower net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments to net income in fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the $18.7 million expense charge to increase the litigation reserve, partially offset by the related increase in deferred tax benefit. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
     Funds held for clients consist of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
     The fluctuations in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities reflect the changing mix of investments. As a result of volatility in the financial markets, in September 2008 we divested of any VRDN securities held and began to utilize U.S. agency discount notes as our primary short-term investment vehicle. U.S. agency discount notes are cash equivalents. VRDNs, although priced and traded as short-term securities, are classified as available-for-sale securities and the cash paid and proceeds received for these securities are included in investing activities. As a result of the divestiture, the proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities exceeded the purchases of available-for-sale securities in fiscal 2009. Much of these proceeds were held as cash equivalents in the funds held for clients' portfolio. In November 2009, we began to again invest in select A-1/P-1-rated VRDNs, although at considerably lower levels than in the prior year. We utilized some of our cash equivalents to purchase these VRDNs, and in fiscal 2010 these purchases of available-for-sale securities were in excess of funds received from any sales of available-for-sale securities. Also in fiscal 2010, more corporate funds have been invested in longer-term municipal bonds. In fiscal 2011, we continued to increase our investment in VRDNs and the amounts of purchases and sales for available-for-sale securities increased. However, partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing within the funds held for clients' portfolio of remittances versus collections. See further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations.
     In general, fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collecting client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services.
     To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately $5.7 million, $3.2 million, and
Purchases of long-lived assets:
 
$4.5 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the "Board").
     During fiscal 2011, we paid $126.4 million for the acquisition of SurePayroll and ePlan. During fiscal 2010, we received $13.1 million from the sale of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company. The purchases of other assets were for customer lists.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
     The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The outflow of funds for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the Federal holiday on May 31, 2010, offset by an increase in client fund obligations for higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for calendar year 2011. As a result of May 31, 2010 being a Federal holiday, client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on Friday, May 28, 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until June 2010. This resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal 2010. Also, for fiscal 2010 there was an increase in client fund obligations as a result of higher withholdings for state unemployment insurance related to rate increases for the 2010 calendar year. May 31, 2011 did not fall on a Federal holiday, so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal 2011.
Net change in client fund obligations:
     A quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share was paid to stockholders of record during fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 87%, 94%, and 84% for those respective fiscal years. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
     Proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock-based awards increased for fiscal 2011 and decreased for fiscal 2010 as compared to the respective prior years. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 0.4 million shares for each of fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009. The increase for fiscal 2011 was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal 2010.

EXHIBIT 99.1
September 27, 2011
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2012 HIGHLIGHTS
 
ROCHESTER, NY, September 27, 2011  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $563.1 million for the three months ended August 31, 2011 (the "first quarter"), an increase of 9% from $518.3 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 13% to $148.9 million and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $0.41 per share. Contributing to the financial results for the first quarter is the inclusion of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") and ePlan Services, Inc. ("ePlan"), which were acquired in the second half of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011").
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are pleased with our results for the first quarter. We continue to see positive trends in our checks per client. We remain cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, despite a lack of robust new business formation, which continues to impact the selling environment."
Payroll service revenue increased 6% to $382.3 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Organic growth in payroll service revenue, excluding SurePayroll, was 4% for the first quarter. This growth was due to increases in both checks per client and revenue per check. Checks per client increased 2.0% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases and lower discounting within our overall client base.
Human Resource Services revenue increased 17% to $169.7 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following:
 
 
Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Services revenue growth for the first quarter would have been 14%, reflecting client growth and price increases. The following factors contributed to this growth:
 
 
 
 
Total expenses increased 5% to $333.4 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely attributable to the inclusion of SurePayroll and ePlan in the first quarter. In addition, continued investment in product development and supporting technology contributed to the increase in total expenses for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. We continue to closely manage personnel costs and expenses as reflected in the increase in operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue.
For the first quarter, our operating income was $229.7 million, an increase of 14% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this Non-GAAP measure) increased 16% to $218.6 million for the first quarter compared to $188.7 million for the same period last year.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% to $11.1 million for the first quarter due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a 10% increase in average investment balances. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from continuing difficult market conditions that produce low interest rates on high credit quality financial securities. The increase in average investment balances was primarily due to the addition of SurePayroll client funds, wage inflation, an increase in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2011 calendar year, and the increase in checks per client. Investment income, net, increased 2% to $1.5 million for the first quarter.
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
 
Page 2 of 8            
Our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer. We invest predominantly in municipal bonds  general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a United States ("U.S.") government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. All the investments we held as of August 31, 2011 were traded in active markets. During the first quarter, our primary short-term investment vehicle has been FDIC-insured deposit accounts instead of the U.S. agency discount securities and variable rate demand notes previously utilized.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $69.7 million as of August 31, 2011, compared with a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During the first quarter, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $55.7 million to $72.5 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $68.6 million as of September 22, 2011.
OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012") is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. Although our first quarter results were encouraging, we expect fiscal 2012 results to be consistent with the expectations we had when we issued our guidance in June 2011. Our expectations are that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both payroll revenue and Human Resource Services revenue. We do not expect the favorability in expenses realized in the first quarter to continue throughout fiscal 2012, as we continue planned investments in our business. Our reaffirmed guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to approximate 36% for fiscal 2012. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to approximate the first quarter tax rate.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the continuing low interest rate environment. As investments in our long-term portfolio mature, the proceeds are being reinvested at lower average interest rates. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations, though at a lower growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal 2011 for business acquisitions. Combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, are expected to decrease approximately 10% for fiscal 2012.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2012 HIGHLIGHTS
 
ROCHESTER, NY, December 20, 2011    Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today reported total revenue of $545.7 million for the three months ended November 30, 2011 (the "second quarter"), a 7% increase from $512.0 million for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $140.4 million and $0.39 per share, respectively. The inclusion of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") and ePlan Services, Inc. ("ePlan"), which were acquired in the second half of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"), contributed to the financial results for the second quarter. These acquisitions contributed approximately 2.0% in total revenue growth for the second quarter.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Paychex delivered solid results for the second quarter. We expanded our software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings with the introduction of our new single sign-on page for online users and an iPad application. Checks per client continued to improve for the second quarter, but, as anticipated, the 1.5% growth rate for the quarter was lower than the 2.0% experienced for the first quarter. This moderation is expected to continue through the remainder of the fiscal year. We have reiterated our guidance for the fiscal year as we continue to see a slow recovery in the economy with respect to sales from new business formations."
Payroll service revenue increased 5% to $371.7 million for the second quarter from the same period last year. Payroll service revenue growth, excluding revenue from SurePayroll, was 3% for the second quarter and was driven by increases in both checks per client and revenue per check. Checks per client increased 1.5% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases and lower discounting within our overall client base.
Human Resource Services revenue increased 12% to $163.3 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. This growth was generated from the following:
 
 
Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Services revenue growth for the second quarter would have been 10%, reflecting client growth and price increases. The following factors contributed to this growth:
 
 
 
Total expenses increased 6% to $327.8 million for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. This was largely attributable to the inclusion of SurePayroll and ePlan in the second quarter. In addition, continued investment in product development and supporting technology contributed to the increase in total expenses for the second quarter compared to the same period last year.
For the second quarter, our operating income was $217.9 million, an increase of 7% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) increased 8% to $207.2 million for the second quarter compared to $191.9 million for the same period last year. We experienced a slight increase in our operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue to 38.7% for the second quarter compared to 38.4% for the same period last year.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 10% to $10.7 million for the second quarter due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by an 8% increase in average investment balances. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from market conditions that produced low interest rates on high credit quality financial securities. The increase in average investment balances was primarily due to the addition of SurePayroll client funds, wage inflation, an increase in state unemployment insurance rates for the 2011 calendar year, and the increase in checks per client. Investment income, net, increased 4% to $1.5 million for the second quarter, but the rate of growth was negatively impacted by lower average investment balances due to cash outflows for business acquisitions during the second half of fiscal 2011.
 
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest primarily in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and short-term securities with A-1/P-1 ratings, with more than 95% of our portfolio rated AA or better.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $53.7 million as of November 30, 2011, compared with a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During the six months ended November 30, 2011, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $46.4 million to $72.5 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $60.5 million as of December 15, 2011.
YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2011 HIGHLIGHTS
The highlights for the six months ended November 30, 2011 are as follows:
 
OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012") is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Consistent with our policy regarding guidance, our projections do not anticipate or speculate on future changes to interest rates. We expect fiscal 2012 results to be consistent with the expectations set forth in our guidance issued in June 2011, and subsequently reaffirmed in September 2011. Our expectation is that growth in checks per client will moderate through the remainder of fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both payroll revenue and Human Resource Services revenue. Our guidance reflects our planned spending, impacting the full year operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue.
 
Our reaffirmed guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37% for fiscal 2012. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to approximate the rate experienced for the six months ended November 30, 2011.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. As investments in our long-term portfolio mature, the proceeds are being reinvested at lower average interest rates. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations, though at a lower growth rate as a result of cash outlays in fiscal 2011 for business acquisitions. Combined interest on funds held for clients and investment income, net, are expected to decrease approximately 10% for fiscal 2012.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2012 HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
ROCHESTER, NY, March 28, 2012  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today reported total revenue of $569.5 million for the three months ended February 29, 2012 (the "third quarter"), a 7% increase from $531.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2011 (the "prior year quarter"). Net income increased 4% to $135.4 million and diluted earnings per share increased 3% to $0.37 per share. The inclusion of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") and ePlan Services, Inc. ("ePlan"), which were acquired in the second half of our fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"), contributed approximately 2% in total revenue growth for the third quarter.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We made good progress in many areas in the third quarter. New payroll sales, excluding SurePayroll, grew moderately compared to the prior year quarter and our Human Resource Services revenue advanced at a double digit rate during the quarter. Growth in checks per payroll improved for the eighth straight quarter and at a rate comparable to the second quarter. We believe that checks per payroll growth will moderate in the remainder of the fiscal year. We continued our product innovation with our new Android application, maintained the highest levels of client satisfaction, and have reiterated our guidance for fiscal 2012."
Payroll service revenue increased 5% to $386.5 million for the third quarter from the prior year quarter. Payroll service revenue growth, excluding revenue from SurePayroll, was 4% for the third quarter, driven by an increase in checks per payroll and a modest increase in revenue per check. Revenue per check was impacted by price increases offset by discounting.
Human Resource Services revenue increased 12% to $172.0 million for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Services revenue growth for the third quarter would have been 10%, reflecting client growth and price increases. The following factors contributed to this growth:
 
 
 
Human Resources Services statistics were as follows:
 
 
Total expenses increased 8% to $359.1 million for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. A portion of this increase is attributable to the inclusion of SurePayroll and ePlan in the third quarter. In addition, continued investment in product development and supporting technology contributed to the increase in total expenses.
For the third quarter, our operating income was $210.4 million, an increase of 6% from the prior year quarter. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) increased 7% to $199.4 million for the third quarter compared to $187.2 million for the prior year quarter.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 7% to $11.0 million for the third quarter, compared to the prior year quarter, due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a 7% increase in average investment balances. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from market conditions that produced low interest rates on high credit quality financial securities. The increase in average investment balances was primarily due to the addition of SurePayroll client funds, wage inflation, state unemployment insurance rate increases for calendar 2012, and the increase in checks per payroll. Investment income, net, increased 5% to $1.6 million for the third quarter, but the rate of growth was negatively impacted by lower growth in average investment balances due to cash outflows for business acquisitions during the second half of fiscal 2011.
 
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. A substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $68.1 million as of February 29, 2012, compared with a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During the nine months ended February 29, 2012, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $46.4 million to $72.5 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $52.8 million as of March 23, 2012.

FISCAL 2012 HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
ROCHESTER, NY, June 27, 2012  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today reported total revenue of $2.2 billion for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012"), a 7% increase from $2.1 billion for the prior fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 ("fiscal 2011"). Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 6% to $548.0 million and $1.51 per share, respectively. The inclusion of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") and ePlan Services, Inc. ("ePlan"), which were acquired in the second half of fiscal 2011, contributed approximately 2% in total revenue growth for fiscal 2012.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We achieved solid results for fiscal 2012. Our organic client base, which had experienced declines for the last three years, ended fiscal 2012 flat compared to the prior year end. We reached a record level of service revenue, as checks per payroll improved for the ninth consecutive quarter, growing 2% for fiscal 2012, and payroll client retention reached near-record levels. Our operations execution excelled as we achieved our highest client satisfaction scores in our history, and our progress in technology innovation continued as we introduced our latest mobility offering to clients with our smartphone application."
Payroll service revenue increased 5% to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2012. Organic growth in payroll service revenue was approximately 4% for fiscal 2012, driven by an increase in checks per payroll and revenue per check. Revenue per check was impacted by price increases offset by discounting. As of May 31, 2012, we served approximately 567,000 clients, an increase of 0.5% from May 31, 2011. Organic growth in our client base for fiscal 2012 was essentially flat, an improvement over the prior year; however, new business formation remains challenged.
Human Resource Services revenue increased 13% to $676.2 million for fiscal 2012. Organic growth in Human Resource Services revenue for fiscal 2012 was approximately 11%, reflecting client growth and price increases. The following factors had a significant contribution to this growth:
 
 
 
Human Resources Services statistics were as follows:
 
 
Total expenses increased 6% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. A portion of this increase is attributable to the inclusion of SurePayroll and ePlan for the full year fiscal 2012. In addition, continued investment in product innovation and supporting technology contributed to the increase in total expenses.
For fiscal 2012, our operating income was $853.9 million, an increase of 9% from fiscal 2011. Operating income, net of certain items (see Note 1 on page 4 for further description of this non-GAAP measure) increased 10% to $810.3 million for fiscal 2012 compared to $738.3 million for fiscal 2011.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% to $43.6 million for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a 7% increase in average investment balances. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from market conditions that produced low interest rates on high credit quality financial securities. The increase in average investment balances was primarily due to the addition of SurePayroll client funds, wage inflation, state unemployment insurance rate increases, and the increase in checks per payroll. Investment income, net, increased 9% to $6.4 million for fiscal 2012, primarily due to growth in average investment balances.
 
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. A substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and with A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $59.5 million as of May 31, 2012, compared with a net unrealized gain of $59.3 million as of May 31, 2011. During fiscal 2012, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $46.4 million to $72.5 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $54.6 million as of June 22, 2012.
FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2012 HIGHLIGHTS
The highlights for the three months ended May 31, 2012 (the "fourth quarter") are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013") is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Commenting on the fiscal 2013 outlook, Mr. Mucci said, "Our expected fiscal 2013 payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth, offset by an expected lower rate of growth in checks per payroll, and modest increases in revenue per check. Human Resource Services revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our historical organic experience. Prior acquisitions are expected to have minimal impact to projected revenue growth rates for fiscal 2013."
Our fiscal 2013 guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of service revenue, is expected to approximate 37% for fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be approximately 36%.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2013 are expected to continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment, as investments in our long-term portfolio mature and the proceeds are reinvested at lower average interest rates. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

Overview
We are a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. Our Payroll and Human Resource Services offer a portfolio of services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Our payroll services are the foundation of our service portfolio. They are provided through either our core payroll or Major Market Services ("MMS"), which is utilized by clients that have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and include:
 
 
 
 
In addition to the above, our software-as-a-service ("SaaS") solution through our MMS platform provides human resource management, employee benefits management, time and attendance systems, online expense reporting, and applicant tracking.
Our Human Resource Services primarily include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our business strategy is focused on achieving strong long-term financial performance by providing high-quality, timely, accurate, and affordable services; growing our client base; increasing utilization of our ancillary services; leveraging our technology and operating infrastructure; and expanding our service offerings. We continue to focus on driving growth in clients, revenue, and profits. We are managing our personnel costs and expenses while continuing to invest in our business, particularly in areas related to innovation and supporting technology. We believe these investments are critical to our success. Looking to the future, we continue to focus on investing in our products, people, and service capabilities, positioning ourselves to capitalize on opportunities for long-term growth.
Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected sustained growth in our business. Our key business indicators of checks per payroll and revenue per check continued to show improvement. Checks per payroll grew 2.0% for fiscal 2012. This growth is slightly less than the growth of 2.7% for fiscal 2011, as expected. Our revenue growth has been moderate, as new business formation remains challenged.
Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the interest rate environment. The equity markets hit a low in March 2009, with interest rates available on high quality financial instruments remaining low since that time. The Federal Funds rate has been at a range of zero to 0.25% since December 2008. Our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for fiscal 2012, compared to 1.3% for fiscal 2011 and 1.5% for fiscal 2010.
Highlights of our financial results for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our results for fiscal 2012 benefited from the inclusion of SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll"), a provider of payroll processing for small businesses, acquired on February 8, 2011, and ePlan Services, Inc. ("ePlan"), a provider of recordkeeping and administrative solutions to the defined contribution marketplace, acquired on May 3, 2011. These acquisitions in fiscal 2011 and an immaterial acquisition in fiscal 2012 contributed approximately 2% in total revenue growth for fiscal 2012.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure
In addition to reporting operating income, a U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients and the expense charge in fiscal 2010 to increase the litigation reserve. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. The expense charge to increase the litigation reserve is also an adjustment to operating income due to its unusual and infrequent nature. It is outside the normal course of our operations and obscures the comparability of performance period over period. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the SEC. As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but
 
in conjunction with the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.
Business Outlook
Our client base totaled approximately 567,000 clients as of May 31, 2012, compared to approximately 564,000 clients as of May 31, 2011, and approximately 536,000 clients as of May 31, 2010. Our client base increased 0.5% for fiscal 2012, compared to an increase of 5.2% for fiscal 2011 and a decline of 3.2% for fiscal 2010. Our organic client base was essentially flat for fiscal 2012 and declined 0.9% for fiscal 2011.
For fiscal 2012, payroll services client retention was approximately 80% of our beginning client base, a return to historical levels. This is a slight increase over fiscal 2011. Through our focus on providing high-quality service to our customers to maximize client retention, we received the highest client satisfaction results in our history.
Our ancillary services provide services to employers and employees beyond payroll, but effectively leverage payroll processing data and, therefore, are beneficial to our operating margin. The following statistics demonstrate the growth in our Human Resource Services ancillary service offerings:
 
 
Continued investment in our business is critical to our success. We continued to expand our product portfolio, through internal development and acquisitions, to add value for our clients. In the second half of fiscal 2011, we acquired SurePayroll and ePlan. These acquisitions have created excellent opportunities in their markets, and allow Paychex to offer a full range of payroll and 401(k) outsourcing alternatives. During fiscal 2012, we continued to integrate these acquired companies. In December 2011, we purchased Icon Time Systems, Inc., a provider of time and attendance solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, with whom we previously had a successful business relationship through one of our time and attendance offerings. Additionally, we launched new ancillary products in fiscal 2012. Our Business Insurance Payment Service relieves business owners of the administrative burden of paying their insurance premiums. Paychex Advisory Select 401(k) is a new offering specifically designed for fee-based financial advisors.
We have focused on launching enhanced technology to support our existing SaaS products. Recent launches include a single sign-on and landing page; Paychex Online Mobile iPad application and Android
TM
tablet application; and, most recently, a smartphone application. These mobile applications allow our clients instant access and increased productivity.
We continued to invest in our Paychex Next Generation platform and its suite of innovative products, as we believe this is a key building block to our future success. This new platform allows us to leverage efficiencies in our processes and to continue to provide excellent customer service to our clients. Our enhanced platform has led to improved productivity within our operations, contributing to the increase in our operating income, net of certain items, as a percentage of service revenue to 37.1% for fiscal 2012, compared to 36.3% for the prior year.
We continued the expansion of our insurance services nationwide, simplifying the process required to obtain coverage through our network of national and regional insurers. We now service approximately 107,000 clients through our subsidiary, Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. We believe insurance services is an area that continues to offer significant opportunities for future growth.
 
 
We have strengthened our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. In an effort to help entrepreneurs and small-business owners achieve similar success, we launched a new website, , that provides tools and resources for starting, growing, and managing a business. In addition, the Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. website, , helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage.

Financial position and liquidity
The volatility in the global financial markets continues to curtail available liquidity in the marketplace and limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, as of May 31, 2012, our financial position remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $790.0 million and no debt.
Our investment strategy focuses on optimizing liquidity and protecting principal. Yields on high quality financial instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. We invest predominately in municipal bonds  general obligation bonds; pre-refunded bonds, which are secured by a U.S. government escrow; and essential services revenue bonds. During fiscal 2012, our primary short-term investment vehicles were high quality variable rate demand notes ("VRDNs") and FDIC-insured deposit accounts.
A substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings and A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair value is less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe that our investments as of May 31, 2012 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment.
Our primary source of cash is our ongoing operations. Cash flow from operations was $706.6 million for fiscal 2012. Historically, we have funded our operations, capital purchases, business acquisitions, and dividend payments from our operating activities. Our positive cash flows in fiscal 2012 allowed us to support our business growth and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. During fiscal 2012, dividends paid to stockholders were 84% of net income. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2012, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
For further analysis of our results of operations for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, and our financial position as of May 31, 2012, refer to the tables and analysis in the "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" sections of this preliminary discussion and analysis.
Outlook
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013") is based upon current economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our expected fiscal 2013 payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth, offset by an expected lower rate of growth in checks per payroll, and modest increases in revenue per check. Human Resource Services revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our historical organic experience. Prior acquisitions are expected to have minimal impact to projected revenue growth rates for fiscal 2013.
 
Our fiscal 2013 guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of service revenue, is expected to approximate 37% for fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to approximate 36%.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2013 are expected to continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. The average rate of return on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios is expected to remain at 1.1% for fiscal 2013. As of May 31, 2012, the long-term investment portfolio had an average yield-to-maturity of 2.2% and an average duration of 3.0 years. In the next twelve months, approximately 15% to 20% of this portfolio will mature, and it is currently anticipated that these proceeds will be reinvested at a lower average interest rate of approximately 1.1%. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations.
Earnings per share for fiscal 2013 is expected to be adversely impacted by approximately $0.01 per share due to a planned increase in our sales force and an increase in employee-related costs for the increase in the 401(k) employer match implemented during fiscal 2012.
Purchases of property and equipment for fiscal 2013 are expected to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. This includes costs for internally developed software as we continue to invest in our product development. Fiscal 2013 depreciation expense is projected to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, and we project amortization of intangible assets for fiscal 2013 to be slightly less than $20 million.
Results of Operations
Summary of Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended May 31:
 
 
We invest in highly liquid, investment-grade fixed income securities and do not utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk. As of May 31, 2012, we had no exposure to high-risk or illiquid investments and had insignificant exposure to European investments. Details regarding our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios are as follows:
 
 
 
 Payroll service revenue increased 5% for fiscal 2012 and 2% for fiscal 2011 to $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Organic growth in payroll service revenue was approximately 4% for fiscal 2012 and 2% for fiscal 2011. Both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 revenue benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check. Checks per payroll increased 2.0% for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2011 increased 2.7% compared to fiscal 2010. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting. Our organic client base growth was essentially flat for fiscal 2012, and declined 0.9% for fiscal 2011, as new business formation remains challenged. Client retention improved for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011.
Payroll service revenue:
Checks per payroll is an estimate. During fiscal 2012, we refined our estimation process. The result was that growth in checks per payroll disclosed in prior periods is moderately higher, but directionally unchanged. Our estimate of checks per payroll excludes SurePayroll clients.
Note:
Human Resource Services revenue increased 13% for fiscal 2012 and 10% for fiscal 2011 to $676.2 million and $597.4 million, respectively. These growth rates were impacted by the acquisition of ePlan in May 2011 and the sale of Stromberg time and attendance operations ("Stromberg"), an immaterial component of Paychex, in October 2009. Organic growth in Human Resource Services revenue, excluding the impacts of these events, was approximately 11% for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, reflecting growth in clients and price increases. The following factors contributed to the growth for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011:
Human Resource Services revenue:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Total service revenue increased 7% for fiscal 2012 and 5% for fiscal 2011, attributable to the factors previously discussed. Organic service revenue growth was approximately 6% for fiscal 2012 and 4% for fiscal 2011.
Total service revenue:
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% for fiscal 2012 and 13% for fiscal 2011 compared to the respective prior year periods. These declines were the result of lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances.
Interest on funds held for clients:
Average investment balances for funds held for clients increased 7% for fiscal 2012 and 6% for fiscal 2011. The increase for fiscal 2012 was the result of the inclusion of SurePayroll client funds, wage inflation, increase in state unemployment insurance rates, and the increase in checks per payroll. The increase in average investment balances for fiscal 2011 was the result of increases in state unemployment insurance rates and the increase in checks per payroll, offset somewhat by the lingering effects of the difficult economic conditions on our client base.
 The following table summarizes total combined operating and selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for fiscal years:
Combined operating and SG&A expenses:
 
 
A significant portion of the increases in expenses for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were driven by the acquisitions during these periods. Organic growth in combined operating and SG&A expenses (exclusive of acquisitions and the aforementioned $18.7 million expense charge in fiscal 2010) was approximately 3% for fiscal 2012 and 2% for fiscal 2011. Increases in product innovation and the supporting technology contributed to the increases in total expenses. Expenses related to information technology increased at a faster pace than overall expenses for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011. Improvements in operations productivity with related lower headcount have moderated these increases.
Compensation-related costs for fiscal 2012 were impacted by increased headcount in areas supporting our development of technology, and higher employee-related costs for health care and 401(k) employer match. In addition, the increase in expenses for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by personnel-related costs, in part due to reinstatement of salary increases and 401(k) employer match during fiscal 2011 along with one-time costs related to the separation agreement entered into with Jonathan J. Judge, our former President and Chief Executive Officer. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, we had approximately 12,400 employees compared with approximately 12,200 employees as of May 31, 2010.
Depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings, furniture and fixtures, data processing equipment, and software. Increases in depreciation expense were due to capital expenditures as we invested in technology and continued to grow our business. Amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client list acquisitions, which are amortized using either straight-line or accelerated methods. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 due to business acquisitions.
Other expenses include items such as delivery, forms and supplies, communications, travel and entertainment, equipment costs, professional services, and other costs incurred to support our business. The increase in other expenses for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of our acquisitions. In addition, higher equipment costs within information technology and higher professional services supporting our technology development contributed to the increases in other expenses for fiscal 2012.
During fiscal 2010, we recorded an expense charge of $18.7 million to increase our litigation reserve.
 Operating income increased 9% for fiscal 2012 and 8% for fiscal 2011. The fluctuations in operating income were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Operating income:
Operating income, net of certain items, is as follows for fiscal years:
 
Refer to the previous discussion of operating income, net of certain items, in the "Non-GAAP Financial Measure" section on page 3.
 Investment income, net, primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities. Investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients, which is included in total revenue. The increases in investment income were primarily the result of higher average invested balances. Average investment balances increased 4% for fiscal 2012 and 1% for fiscal 2011. The increases were the result of investment of cash generated from operations, partially offset by the impact on balances of cash utilized to fund the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan during the second half of fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 benefited from a slight increase in average interest rates earned on corporate investments that was primarily driven by higher yields on funds invested into our longer-term investment portfolio compared to the prior year.
Investment income, net:
 Our effective income tax rate was 36.3% for fiscal 2012 compared to 35.0% for fiscal 2011 and 34.6% for fiscal 2010. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of changes in state apportionment and lower levels of tax-exempt income derived from municipal debts securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to lower tax-exempt income on available-for-sale securities during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
Income taxes:
 
 Net income increased 6% to $548.0 million for fiscal 2012 and 8% to $515.3 million for fiscal 2011. Diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $1.51 per share for fiscal 2012 and 8% to 1.42 per share for fiscal 2011. These fluctuations were attributable to the factors previously discussed.
Net income and earnings per share:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The volatility in the global financial markets continues to curtail available liquidity in the marketplace and limit investment choices. Despite this macroeconomic environment, our financial position as of May 31, 2012 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $790.0 million and no debt. We also believe that our investments as of May 31, 2012 were not other-than-temporarily impaired, nor has any event occurred subsequent to that date that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment. We anticipate that cash and total corporate investments as of May 31, 2012, along with projected operating cash flows, will support our normal business operations, capital purchases, and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.
Operating Cash Flow Activities
 
The decrease in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 resulted mainly from fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. The increase in our operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 resulted mainly from increases in net income and fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, income tax, and other liabilities.
Investing Cash Flow Activities
 
 Funds held for clients consist of short-term funds and available-for-sale securities. Corporate investments are primarily comprised of available-for-sale securities. The fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is largely due to timing within the client fund portfolio, as there was a large inflow of collections on May 31, 2012 that was invested primarily in short-term investments on that date. See further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations. In addition, we increased our investment in longer-term available-for-sale securities within our corporate portfolio in fiscal 2012.
Funds held for clients and corporate investments:
The fluctuation in the net change in funds held for clients and corporate investment activities for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was related to mix of investment securities. In fiscal 2011, we continued to increase our investment in VRDNs and the amounts of purchases and sales for available-for-sale securities increased. However, partially offsetting this impact was the related liquidation of cash equivalents and the impact on cash equivalents from timing of remittances within the funds held for clients' portfolio as compared to collections surrounding the fiscal year-end. See further discussion of this timing in the financing cash flows discussion of net change in client fund obligations.
In general, fluctuations in net funds held for clients and corporate investment activities primarily relate to timing of purchases, sales, or maturities of investments. The amount of funds held for clients will vary based upon the timing of collection of client funds, and the related remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services.
 
 To support our continued client and ancillary product growth, purchases of property and equipment were made for data processing equipment and software, and for the expansion and upgrade of various operating facilities. During fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, we purchased approximately $2.6 million, $5.7 million, and $3.2 million, respectively, of data processing equipment and software from EMC Corporation. The Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of EMC Corporation is a member of our Board of Directors (the "Board").
Purchases of long-lived assets:
During fiscal 2012, we had an immaterial business acquisition. During fiscal 2011, we paid $126.4 million for the acquisitions of SurePayroll and ePlan. During fiscal 2010, we received $13.1 million from the sale of Stromberg, an immaterial component of the Company. The purchases of other assets were for customer lists.
Financing Cash Flow Activities
 
The client fund obligations liability will vary based on the timing of collecting client funds, and the related required remittance of funds to applicable tax or regulatory agencies for payroll tax administration services and to employees of clients utilizing employee payment services. Collections from clients are typically remitted from one to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days.
Net change in client fund obligations:
The fluctuation in net change in client fund obligations for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is the result of timing of collections and remittances as May 31, 2012 fell on a Thursday, a large collection day for direct pay funds. These funds were then paid out on Friday, June 1, 2012. In 2011, May 31 fell on a Tuesday, and there were lower collections from clients on that day. In addition, overall client fund balances were 7% higher on average for fiscal 2012 than for fiscal 2011.
The fluctuation in net change in client fund obligations for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is the result of timing of collections and remittances surrounding the Federal holiday on May 31, 2010, offset by an increase in average client collections primarily due to higher state unemployment insurance rates. As a result of May 31, 2010 being a Federal holiday, client fund obligations were higher as collections were made on Friday, May 28, 2010 that were not remitted to client employees and tax or regulatory agencies until June 2010. This resulted in a positive cash flow impact for fiscal 2010. May 31, 2011 did not fall on a Federal holiday, so we did not have the same level of client fund holdings at the end of fiscal 2011.
 In October 2011, the Board increased our quarterly dividend to stockholders by 3% to $0.32 per share from $0.31 per share. A quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share was paid to stockholders of record during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the fiscal years 2011 and 2010. The dividends paid as a percentage of net income totaled 84%, 87%, and 94% for those respective fiscal years. The payment of future dividends is dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and is subject to the discretion of our Board.
Dividends paid:
 Proceeds from exercise and excess tax benefit related to stock-based awards increased for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 compared to the respective prior years. Common shares acquired through exercise of stock options were 0.2 million shares for fiscal 2012 and 0.4 million shares for both fiscal 2011 and 2010. The increase in proceeds for fiscal 2011 was the result of a higher average exercise price than for fiscal 2012 or 2010.

EXHIBIT 99.1
September 24, 2012
FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2013 HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
ROCHESTER, NY, September 24, 2012  Paychex, Inc. ("Paychex," "we," "our," or "us") (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $578.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2012 (the "first quarter"), an increase of 3% from $563.1 million for the same period last year. Net income increased 3% to $153.1 million and diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $0.42 per share.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The first quarter has fiscal 2013 off to a good start with results meeting our expectations. Our client base continued to improve, checks per payroll continued to increase, and our client retention is near a historic high. Growth rates reflect fluctuations in the frequency of payroll processing compared to the same period last year. For fiscal 2013, we have reaffirmed our financial guidance."
Payroll service revenue increased 1% to $385.9 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Checks per payroll increased 2.0% for the first quarter compared to 2.4% for the same period last year. Revenue per check grew modestly, impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting. Growth was tempered by the impact of greater payroll processing per day in the same period last year.
Human Resource Services ("HRS") revenue increased 7% to $182.2 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. The following factors contributed to this growth:
 
 
 
 
Total expenses increased 2% to $340.2 million for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. We continued our investment in product development and supporting technology, with those expenses growing at a faster rate than total expenses during the first quarter. This was offset by increased productivity within operations, which has allowed us to maintain solid operating margins.
For the first quarter, our operating income was $238.0 million, an increase of 4% from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items, (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this Non-GAAP financial measure) also increased 4% to $227.9 million for the first quarter compared to $218.6 million for the same period last year.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased 9% to $10.1 million for the first quarter, compared to the same period last year. This was due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a 1% increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was related to favorability in checks per payroll and payroll tax administration services clients, offset somewhat by calendar impacts. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from declines in average yields on high credit quality financial securities. Also, the lower rate of return reflected the mix in the short-term investment portfolio, with a greater percentage of the portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities. Tax-exempt securities typically earn a lower rate of return, but are expected to lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income, net, increased 30% to $1.9 million for the first quarter.
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. A substantial portion of our portfolios is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and with A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of $58.8 million as of August 31, 2012, compared with a net unrealized gain of $59.5 million as of May 31, 2012. During the first quarter, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios ranged from $54.0 million to $63.4 million. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately $58.4 million as of September 20, 2012.
OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013") is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our expected full year fiscal 2013 payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth, offset by an expected lower rate of growth in checks per payroll, and modest increases in revenue per check. HRS revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our historical organic experience. Prior acquisitions are expected to have minimal impact on projected revenue growth rates for fiscal 2013.
 
Our reaffirmed guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue is expected to approximate 37% for fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to approximate the first quarter tax rate.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2013 are expected to continue to be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment. Our rate of return will be impacted by an anticipated change in mix in our short-term portfolio to a greater percentage of tax-exempt securities. Tax exempt securities typically earn a lower rate of return, but are expected to lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income is expected to benefit from ongoing investment of cash generated from operations.
: In addition to reporting operating income, a United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following year's targets and measuring management's performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

For Immediate Release
Paychex Accelerates Dividend Payments for Two Quarters
Company to pay Q3 and Q4 dividends for fiscal 2013 in December 2012
Rochester, N.Y. (December 10, 2012)
-
The Board of Directors of Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX), a leading provider of payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses, today declared an accelerated dividend for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 totaling $.66 per share of common stock. The accelerated dividend is intended by the Board to be in lieu of quarterly dividends Paychex would otherwise have announced in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, and paid in February and May 2013.
The accelerated dividend is payable December 28, 2012 to shareholders of record December 20, 2012.
The Board's vote today in support of the dividend acceleration is very consistent with Paychex's shareholder-friendly approach, said Martin Mucci, Paychex president and chief executive officer. We do expect taxes on dividends to increase, and we are in a position to accelerate dividend payments, so taking this step is another reflection of our commitment to delivering shareholder value.

PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS
SECOND
QUARTER RESULTS
December 19, 2012
SECOND
QUARTER
FISCAL 2013
HIGHLIGHTS
ROCHESTER, NY,
December 19, 2012
 Paychex, Inc. (Paychex, we, our, or us) (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total service revenue of
$559.4 million
for the
three
months ended
November 30, 2012
(the 
second
quarter), an increase of
5%
from
$535.0 million
for the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased
5%
to
$147.9 million
and
$0.41
per share, respectively.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, We made solid progress in the second quarter.  While payroll services revenue grew modestly at 1.4%, impacted by client disruptions from Hurricane Sandy, Human Resource Services revenue grew at a double-digit rate as we continue to experience success in selling value-added solutions to our clients. Checks per payroll increased
1.2%
for the quarter over the previous year.  We are seeing good results from our selling efforts in the small-business market and are well-positioned for our peak selling season.  In addition, our client retention levels remain near historic high rates generated by our employees' commitment to client satisfaction.  During the quarter, we introduced our industry-leading online client report center and acquired ExpenseWire, an online expense management solution for our mid-market clients.
Payroll service revenue increased
1%
to
$377.0 million
for the
second
quarter compared to the same period last year. Checks per payroll increased
1.2%
for the
second
quarter compared to
1.8%
for the same period last year. Revenue per check grew modestly, as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting. Growth in payroll service revenue was tempered by lost revenue from Hurricane Sandy, approximating 0.5% of payroll revenue growth, and the impact of client mix in the mid-market.
Human Resource Services (HRS) revenue increased
12%
to
$182.4 million
for the
second
quarter compared to the same period last year. The following factors contributed to this growth:
Total expenses increased
4%
to
$339.4 million
for the
second
quarter compared to the same period last year. We continued to invest in product development and supporting technology, with those expenses growing at a faster rate than total expenses during the
second
quarter. This was offset by increased productivity within operations, which has allowed us to maintain solid operating margins.
1
For the
second
quarter, our operating income was
$230.0 million
, an increase of
6%
from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items, (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this Non-GAAP financial measure) also increased
6%
to
$220.0 million
for the
second
quarter compared to
$207.2 million
for the same period last year.
 
Interest on funds held for clients decreased
8%
to
$10.0 million
for the
second
quarter, compared to the same period last year. This was due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a
4%
increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was related to growth in checks per payroll and payroll tax administration services clients, wage inflation, and calendar impacts. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from declines in average yields on high credit quality financial securities. Also, the lower rate of return reflected the mix in the short-term investment portfolio, with a greater percentage of the portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities. Tax-exempt securities typically earn a lower pre-tax rate of return, but are expected to generate lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income, net, increased
22%
to
$1.9 million
for the
second
quarter, primarily as a result of higher average investment balances from investment of cash generated from operations.
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. A substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and with A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of
$62.9 million
as of
November 30, 2012
, compared with a net unrealized gain of
$59.5 million
as of
May 31, 2012
. During the first six months, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio ranged from

YEAR-TO-DATE
FISCAL 2013
HIGHLIGHTS
The highlights for the
six
months ended
November 30, 2012
are as follows:
OUTLOOK
Our outlook for the fiscal year ending
May 31, 2013
(
fiscal 2013
) is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our expected full year
fiscal 2013
payroll revenue growth rate is based upon anticipated client base growth, offset by an expected lower rate of growth in checks per payroll, and modest increases in revenue per check. HRS revenue growth is expected to remain in line with our historical organic experience. Prior acquisitions are expected to have minimal impact on projected revenue growth rates for
fiscal 2013
.
Our revised guidance is as follows:
 
Operating income, net of certain items, as a percent of total service revenue is expected to be approximately
37%
for
fiscal 2013
. The effective income tax rate for
fiscal 2013
is expected to approximate the tax rate for the first
six
months.
Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for
fiscal 2013
are expected to continue to be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment. Our rate of return will be impacted by an anticipated change in mix in our short-term portfolio to a greater percentage of tax-exempt securities. Tax-exempt securities typically earn a lower rate of return, but are expected to lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income growth reflects the impact of anticipated lower average investment balances in the second half of the fiscal year.
Note 1
: In addition to reporting operating income, a United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) measure, we present operating income, net of certain items, which is a non-GAAP measure. We believe operating income, net of certain items, is an appropriate additional measure, as it is an indicator of our core business operations performance period over period. It is also the basis of the measure used internally for establishing the following years targets and measuring managements performance in connection with certain performance-based compensation payments and awards. Operating income, net of certain items, excludes interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients is an adjustment to operating income due to the volatility of interest rates, which are not within the control of management. Operating income, net of certain items, is not calculated through the application of GAAP and is not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As such, it should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of operating income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.

PRESS RELEASE OF PAYCHEX, INC. DATED MARCH 27, 2013
PAYCHEX, INC. REPORTS
THIRD
QUARTER RESULTS
March 27, 2013
THIRD
QUARTER
FISCAL 2013
HIGHLIGHTS
ROCHESTER, NY,
March 27, 2013
 Paychex, Inc. (Paychex, we, our, or us) (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total service revenue of
$582.4 million
for the
three
months ended
February 28, 2013
(the 
third
quarter), an increase of
4%
from
$558.5 million
for the same period last year. Net income increased
7%
to
$144.5 million
and diluted earnings per share increased
8%
to
$0.40
per share.
Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, Paychex made good progress again in the third quarter. We saw improvement in payroll services revenue with growth of
2%
for the third quarter, up from 1% growth experienced for the first half of the fiscal year. Checks per payroll were strong for the third quarter, increasing over 2% compared to the prior year third quarter. Our Human Resource Services revenue continued to grow at a double-digit rate. We completed our peak selling season and were pleased with our positive growth in new Core payroll sales revenue."
Mr. Mucci added, "The Company continues to invest in our market-leading software-as-a-solution ("SaaS") technology and mobile applications through both product development and acquisitions of companies with SaaS-based business models, including our SurePayroll product which continues to perform well. A focus on new and enhanced technology coupled with our outstanding service model has led to retention success. Our client retention remains at record levels, generated by our employees' commitment to client satisfaction."
Payroll service revenue increased
2%
to
$393.7 million
for the
third
quarter compared to the same period last year. Checks per payroll increased
2.3%
for the
third
quarter compared to
1.8%
for the same period last year, partially due to higher calendar year-end bonus payment activity. Revenue per check grew modestly, as a result of price increases, partially offset by discounting. Growth in payroll service revenue was tempered by one less day of payroll processing in the quarter due to the leap year last year.
Human Resource Services (HRS) revenue increased
10%
to
$188.7 million
for the
third
quarter compared to the same period last year. The following factors contributed to this growth:
1
Total expenses increased
3%
to
$368.3 million
for the
third
quarter compared to the same period last year. We continued to invest in product development and supporting technology, with those expenses growing at a faster rate than total expenses during the
third
quarter. This was offset by increased productivity within operations, which has allowed us to maintain solid operating margins.
For the
third
quarter, our operating income was
$225.0 million
, an increase of
7%
from the same period last year. Operating income, net of certain items, (see Note 1 on page 3 for further description of this Non-GAAP financial measure) also increased
7%
to
$214.1 million
for the
third
quarter compared to
$199.4 million
for the same period last year.
 
Interest on funds held for clients was flat at
$10.9 million
for the
third
quarter, compared to the same period last year. This was due to lower average interest rates earned, offset by a
6%
increase in average investment balances. The increase in average investment balances was driven primarily by the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012, which resulted in higher employee social security withholdings, growth in checks per payroll, and wage inflation. The decrease in average interest rates earned resulted from declines in average yields on high credit quality financial securities. Also, the lower rate of return reflected the mix in the short-term investment portfolio, with a greater percentage of the portfolio invested in tax-exempt securities. Tax-exempt securities typically earn a lower pre-tax rate of return, but are expected to generate lower income tax expense on interest earned. Investment income, net, decreased
11%
to
$1.4 million
for the
third
quarter, primarily as a result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances resulting from the accelerated dividend payment to stockholders in December 2012.
Average investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:
 
Our investment strategy focuses on protecting principal and optimizing liquidity. Yields on high quality instruments remain low, negatively impacting our income earned on funds held for clients and corporate investments. A substantial portion of our portfolio is invested in high credit quality securities with AAA and AA ratings, and with A-1/P-1 ratings on short-term securities.
2
The available-for-sale securities within the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios reflected a net unrealized gain of
$51.9 million
as of
February 28, 2013
, compared with a net unrealized gain of
$59.5 million
as of
May 31, 2012
. During the
nine
months ended
February 28, 2013
, the net unrealized gain on our investment portfolio ranged from
$47.3 million
to
$64.1 million
. The net unrealized gain on our investment portfolios was approximately
$45.5 million
as of
March 22, 2013
.

(NON-EXCLUSIVE)
March 26, 2013
Paychex, Inc.
911 Panorama Trail South
Rochester, NY 14625
This letter agreement (this Letter Agreement) confirms the terms and conditions under which J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) will act as non-exclusive agent for Paychex, Inc. (the Purchaser) in connection with the Purchasers program (the Program) to repurchase shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 (the Securities).
(a)     Unless otherwise agreed to, the Purchaser will provide JPMS with instructions on a daily basis in respect of the Program regarding the total number of Securities JPMS is authorized to purchase and target amounts of Securities to be acquired during the day succeeding such instruction and the maximum price or the range of prices to be paid therefore. Except as otherwise provided in this Letter Agreement, JPMS shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing, amount, prices and manner of purchase of Securities on any day, so long as such purchases are consistent with the instruction provided by the Purchaser for such day.
(b)    In the event that JPMS, in its discretion, determines that it is appropriate with regard to any legal, regulatory or self-regulatory requirements or related internal policies and procedures (whether or not such requirements, policies or procedures are imposed by law or have been voluntarily adopted by JPMS) for JPMS to refrain from purchasing Securities or to purchase fewer than the number of Securities otherwise specified in the instructions provided by the Purchaser on any day, then JPMS may, in its sole discretion, elect that the number of Securities purchased shall be reduced for such day to an amount determined by JPMS in its discretion.
(a)     This Letter Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein have been duly authorized by the Purchaser; this Letter Agreement is the valid and binding agreement of the Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms; performance of the transactions contemplated herein will not violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the Purchaser or conflict with or result in a breach of or constitute a default under any agreement or instrument to which the Purchaser is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound or its certificate of incorporation or by-laws; and no governmental, administrative or official consent, approval, authorization, notice or filing is required for performance of the transactions contemplated herein.
2
(b)    At any time during the term of this Letter Agreement that JPMS has been instructed to purchase Securities in connection with the Program, the Purchaser is not aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Purchaser or the Securities. In the event that the Purchaser affirmatively instructs JPMS not to purchase Securities on any day or for any period, the Purchaser agrees that it shall not communicate to JPMS the reason for such instruction.
(c)    The Purchaser is not entering into this Letter Agreement to create actual or apparent trading activity in the Securities (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for the Securities) or to raise or depress the price of the Securities (or any security convertible into or exchangeable for the Securities) for the purpose of inducing others to buy or sell Securities, and will not engage in any other securities or derivative transaction to such ends.
(d)    The Purchaser acknowledges that JPMS is a financial institution and financial participant within the meaning of Sections 101(22) and 101(22A), respectively, of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code). The parties hereto further agree and acknowledge that each transaction under this Letter Agreement is intended to be a securities contract as defined in Section 741(7) of the Bankruptcy Code and each payment or delivery of cash, Securities or other property or assets hereunder is a settlement payment within the meaning of Section 741(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the parties hereto are to be entitled to the protections afforded by, among other Sections, Sections 362(b)(6), 362(b)(27), 362(o), 546(e), 546(j), 555 and 561 of the Bankruptcy Code.
(e)    Prior to 8:00 a.m., New York City time on each day on which JPMS is instructed to purchase Securities pursuant to this Letter Agreement, the Purchaser will provide to JPMS, in addition to the instructions described in Section 5(a), all information, other than publicly reported trading volumes, necessary for JPMS to calculate the maximum number of Securities that may be purchased on such day in accordance with the volume condition set forth in Rule 10b-18 including without limitation any block purchases by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any affiliated purchaser of the Purchaser, and JPMS shall be entitled to rely on such information so provided.
(f)    Without limiting the generality of Section 3 of this Letter Agreement, the Purchaser shall notify JPMS in writing at least five business days prior to engaging in any transaction that would cause the Securities (or any securities convertible into, exchangeable for or linked in value to the Securities) to be subject to a "restricted period" under, and as defined in, Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
