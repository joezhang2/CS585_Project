Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL Financial Statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it is expected that this will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business information in general).
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium of over 170 organizations originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"). XBRL International got its start in the Fall of 1999 when 13 companies came together to discuss the value and benefits of tagging financial information using XML, and Microsoft was one of the 13 "charter" members. The initial goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze financial reporting information.
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
Key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies or dictionaries. For this filing, Microsoft has used a draft version of the forthcoming US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) 2.0 taxonomy. XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also had to create an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system. Please see the "Instructions" below for extracting the XBRL files for your review and use.
 
Instructions
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the original Microsoft XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K:
 
 
The "g13261msft-instance.jpg" file contains the core financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Stockholders Equity Statements) in XBRL format. The remaining files are the taxonomy or dictionary files used to create the "g13261msft-instance.jpg" file.
 
Each graphic file will be listed as a separate document, typically at the end. If you would like to access or view the XBRL Financial Statements or XBRL Taxonomies, please follow these instructions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The SEC's EDGAR site provides hyperlinks to each of the image files individually. Access to these files will vary depending on the EDGAR information provider; please ask your EDGAR provider for additional information on accessing files within an EDGAR filing.

Item 9. Information Provided Under Item 12 (Results of Operations and Financial Condition)
 
The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On April 15, 2003, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $7.84 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, an 8 percent increase over revenue of $7.25 billion for the same period in the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter grew 13 percent to $3.72 billion, compared to operating income of $3.30 billion reported in the prior year. Net income for the quarter was $2.79 billion, compared to $2.74 billion reported in the previous year. Diluted earnings per share for the March 2003 quarter were $0.26.
Redmond, Wash.  April 15, 2003 
 
"We reported another quarter of strong revenue and operating income results in a very tough environment," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "While there is obviously a great deal of economic uncertainty ahead, our ongoing investment in R&D has resulted in a broad product pipeline, including upcoming releases of Windows
Server 2003, Visual Studio
.NET 2003, Exchange 2003 and Office 2003. We believe that these innovative products will enable our customers to get more productivity and value out of their IT investments."
 
Information Worker revenue was up 9 percent compared to the same period last year, driven by positive customer demand for Office XP. Customers acquiring Office this quarter included Air Products and Chemicals Inc., Northern Trust Corporation and Pier 1 Imports. Also during the quarter, the company announced the broad availability of Beta 2 for Office 2003. With initial customer demand exceeding expectations, the company now plans to issue more than 600,000 copies of the Beta 2 kits.
 
Server Platforms revenue grew 21 percent compared to the third quarter of last year, reflecting continued strong performance across a breadth of server products, including Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 and the Windows 2000 Server family of products. Customers acquiring Microsoft server software this quarter include H & R Block, ING Group and Nextel Partners Inc. Revenue growth for Windows 2000 Server was driven by continued market share gains of Intel-based server hardware over proprietary Unix products. Microsoft SQL Server 2000 posted healthy revenue growth of nearly 40 percent, driven by strong demand for SQL Server Enterprise Edition among companies deploying mission-critical applications.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions posted year-over-year revenue growth of 96 percent, benefiting from the inclusion of revenues from Navision, acquired by Microsoft in July 2002. During the third quarter, Microsoft Business Solutions introduced the highly anticipated Microsoft Customer Relationship Management (CRM) product. "We are pleased with the initial customer and partner enthusiasm for Microsoft CRM. At the end of the quarter, we already had over 1,000 authorized partners and more than 150 ISVs for Microsoft CRM," said Doug Burgum, president, Microsoft Business Solutions. "Microsoft CRM represents a key component in our overall mission to deliver transformational solutions that enable businesses in the midmarket to enhance and deepen the relationships they have with customers."
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2003:

Revenue
 
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 was $7.84 billion, an increase of 8% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. The revenue growth was driven primarily by recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods offset by a 42% decrease in Home and Entertainment revenue.
 
Product Revenue
 
Microsoft's seven segments are: Client; Server Platforms; Information Worker; Business Solutions; MSN; CE/Mobility; and Home and Entertainment.
 
includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Me, Windows 98, Tablet PC, and embedded systems. Client revenue was $2.54 billion in the third quarter, increasing 10% compared to $2.30 billion in the third quarter of the prior year. The quarterly revenue growth was driven by a 9 percentage point increase to 56% of the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the OEM channel, and recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods. Offsetting the shift to higher priced Windows operating systems was the effect of a decrease in inventory levels at certain multinational OEMs within the third quarter of fiscal 2003 leading to a 4% decline in licenses purchased compared to the prior year's third quarter.
Client
 
consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, Systems Management Server, Windows Terminal Server, and Small Business Server. It also includes BackOffice/Core CALs, developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Server Platforms revenue grew 21% to $1.83 billion in the third quarter, driven by an increase in Windows-based server shipments, growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue, and recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods. Server revenue including CALs grew 17% from the prior year's third quarter. Consulting and Premier product support services increased 18% compared to the prior year's third quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services increased 40% due to recognition of previously unearned revenue.
Server Platforms
 
includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, other standalone information worker applications, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.33 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, increasing 9% from the prior year's third quarter due to recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods and a 40% increase in revenue from the combined total of Project, Visio, and other standalone applications, partially offset by a decline in new organizational licensing for Office Suites.
Information Worker
 
includes Microsoft Great Plains; bCentral; and Navision. Business Solutions revenue for the third quarter was $147 million compared to $75 million in the prior year's third quarter. A total of $73 million of additional sales revenue is attributable to the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year along with increased customer demand for Navision products.
Business Solutions
 
includes MSN Subscription and MSN Network services. MSN revenue totaled $508 million in the third quarter compared to $404 million in the prior year's third quarter. MSN Subscription revenue grew 9% reflecting an increase in the number of revenue generating subscribers due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs. MSN Network services revenue grew 55% as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions.
MSN
 
includes Pocket PC, Handheld PC, other Mobility, CE operating systems, and MapPoint. Third quarter revenue totaled $38 million, compared to $21 million in the prior year's third quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and market acceptance of Windows CE, offset by declines in revenue from Handheld PCs. Prior year CE/Mobility revenue has been restated to reflect the third quarter 2003 reorganization of MapPoint from Information Worker to CE/Mobility.
CE/Mobility
 
includes the Xbox video game system; PC games; consumer software and hardware; and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $453 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, decreasing 42% from $778 million in the prior year's third quarter. The revenue decrease was caused primarily by lower sales of Xbox video game systems and related games in all geographic regions, compared to the prior year's third quarter which benefited from the recent launch of the Xbox console. The prior year's third quarter reflected the launch of Xbox in Europe and Japan, and sales in the United States from the launch in the preceding quarter. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined 22% compared to a year ago.
Home and Entertainment
 
Distribution Channels
 
Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses, organizational licenses, online services and products, and retail packaged products. These distribution channels are aligned geographically with the exception of OEM customers which are generally managed centrally.
 
The Company's three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the Americas Region, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (EMEA), and the Japan and Asia-Pacific Region. For fiscal year 2003, Microsoft reorganized the alignment of countries located in the South Pacific to be included as part of the Japan and Asia-Pacific region. Prior year geographic revenue has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. Sales of organizational licenses and retail packaged products via these channels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers.
 
channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who pre-install Microsoft products, primarily on PCs. OEM revenue for the third quarter was $2.50 billion, up 9% from $2.29 billion in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002. The OEM revenue growth reflects a 4% decline in reported licenses, compared to an estimated small increase in PC shipments compared to the prior year, a 44% increase in Windows Professional revenue due to an increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional licenses, and 36% Server revenue growth. The growth rate was negatively affected by a decrease in inventory levels at certain multinationals during the third quarter of 2003, leading to lower licenses purchased.
OEM
 
revenue in the third quarter was $2.91 billion, an increase of 9% compared to $2.66 billion in the prior year's third quarter. The Americas region revenue growth was primarily the result of recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods for Client, Information Worker and Server products. This revenue growth was partially offset by a 37% decrease in Home and Entertainment revenue compared to the prior year's third quarter, primarily due to lower Xbox gaming console sales.
Americas Region
 
revenue was $1.56 billion, increasing 12% from the $1.39 billion reported in the third quarter of the prior year. Revenue growth reflected recognition of unearned revenue from strong multi-year licensing in prior periods for Client, Information Worker and Server products. The acquisition of Navision in the first quarter of 2003 also led to an increase in third quarter revenue in the region compared to the prior year's third quarter. The revenue growth was further aided by favorable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year's third quarter exchange rates. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the third quarter of 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 1% instead of increasing 12%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses. Partially offsetting the revenue growth, Home and Entertainment sales, primarily Xbox sales, in the region declined 50% from the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region
 
revenue decreased 4% to $871 million from $912 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The region's revenue decrease reflected a 50% decline in Home and Entertainment sales, primarily Xbox gaming consoles, an 18% decrease in Client revenue, a 1% decline in Information Worker revenue, primarily localized versions of Microsoft Office XP, partially offset by a 14% growth in Server Platforms revenue. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the third quarter of 2002, revenue in the region would have decreased 10% instead of decreasing 4%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses.
Japan and Asia-Pacific Region
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the third quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's comparable quarter been in effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $210 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Operating Expenses
 
was $1.22 billion, or 15.5% of revenue, in the third quarter, compared to $1.40 billion, or 19.3% of revenue, in the third quarter of the prior year. The decrease in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, resulted primarily from a 39% decrease in Home & Entertainment costs associated with a decline in the volume of Xbox video game consoles.
Cost of revenue
 
expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 were $1.11 billion, 14.2% of revenue, an increase of 4% in absolute dollar terms over the third quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a 9% increase in headcount-related costs and a 43% increase in third party product development costs associated with upcoming product launches in Server Platforms.
Research and development
 
expenses were $1.49 billion in the third quarter, or 19.1% of revenue, compared to $1.24 billion in the third quarter of the prior year, or 17.1% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to several marketing initiatives, including the Global Alliance Campaign and Business Agility Campaign, and headcount-related expenses associated with the additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium sales forces.
Sales and marketing
 
costs were $300 million in the third quarter compared to $246 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased principally due to a 15% increase in headcount-related costs.
General and administrative
 
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other incorporates Microsoft's share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other increased to $19 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $11 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002, due to a larger loss from the Company's equity investment in MSNBC entities and T1MSN.
 
The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter is 33%. The tax rate is expected to be 33% for the remainder of fiscal year 2003. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32%.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
A portion of Microsoft's revenue from Enterprise Agreements, Software Assurance, Upgrade Advantage and other volume licensing programs is earned ratably over the period of the license agreement. Also, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including technical support and Internet browser technologies, is based on the average sales price of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned and recognized ratably for undelivered elements ranges from approximately 20% to 25% for Windows XP Home, approximately 10% to 15% for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 10% to 15% for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three years for Windows operating systems and 18 months for desktop applications.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2003 declined $304 million from December 31, 2002 reflecting a sequential decrease in new multi-year licensing agreements coupled with continued recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods. Of the $8.53 billion of unearned revenue at March 31, 2003, $2.55 billion is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, $1.94 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.40 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, $916 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, and $1.73 billion thereafter.
 
Financial Condition
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $46.18 billion as of March 31, 2003. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 was $4.17 billion, compared to $4.12 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The slight increase reflects a 26% increase in cash flow from accounts receivables and a higher net income from operations, partially offset by reduction in new multi-year contract billings. Cash used for financing was $1.21 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $251 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. This increase in cash used from the prior year reflected the payment of an $857 million cash dividend, a $163 million increase in stock repurchases, and a $60 million increase of common stock issuances primarily for ESPP and employee stock option programs. The Company repurchased 30.7 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in the third quarter, compared to 23.1 million shares repurchased in the prior year. Cash used for investing was $4.21 billion in the third quarter, an increase of $211 million from the prior year reflecting slightly higher investing activity.
 
Employee Stock Options (ESOs)
 
The Company encourages broad-based employee ownership of Microsoft stock through an ESO program in which the majority of employees are eligible to participate. At March 31, 2003, 1.66 billion vested and unvested options were outstanding, compared to 10.72 billion common shares outstanding.
 
Microsoft follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25, , to account for ESOs, which generally does not require income statement recognition of options granted at the market price on the date of issuance. FICA and Medicare payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises are recorded as an expense. Other events such as the accelerated vesting of options can also trigger recording an expense. These costs were reflected in each operating expense line item in the income statement.
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
Earnings per share calculations reflect exercised ESOs and the dilutive effect of outstanding ESOs under the treasury stock method. In addition, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, , the Company discloses the value of ESO grants and employee stock purchase plans using the Black-Scholes option valuation method and the pro forma impact of expensing such value over the vesting period of the ESOs in the notes to its annual financial statements.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
ESOs are often granted upon hire to new employees, annually to the majority of employees, and occasionally to certain other employees. In the following table, Microsoft has electively disclosed the pro forma income statements for the three months and twelve months ended March 31, 2003, in accordance with SFAS 123.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached as an exhibit to this report are Microsoft Corporation's consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2002 and March 31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2002 and 2003 formatted in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language). These documents are presented for illustration purposes only. These are not the official publicly filed financial statements of Microsoft Corporation. No representation is made that the information presented is accurate or complete and they are not to be used for investment purposes.
 
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 190 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2002-10-15. XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K:

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $8.07 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, an 11% increase over revenue of $7.25 billion for the same period in the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter came in at $2.19 billion, which included charges of $796 million primarily related to the settlement of the AOL Time Warner lawsuit. This is compared to operating income of $2.87 billion reported in the prior year period. Net income for the quarter was $1.92 billion, including $533 million in after-tax settlement charges, compared to $1.53 billion reported in the previous year, which included an after-tax charge for investment impairments of $806 million. Diluted earnings per share for the June 2003 quarter were $0.18, including an after-tax charge of $0.05 associated with the legal settlements. The prior year's diluted earnings per share were $0.14, including an after-tax investment impairment charge of $0.07.
Redmond, Wash.  July 17, 2003 
 
"In fiscal year 2003, we reported double digit revenue growth in each of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, sales came in better than expected reflecting solid corporate and consumer demand for our products," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Going into the new year, we will continue to focus on providing better customer value, growing opportunities with small and medium businesses, increasing our enterprise penetration and improving performance in our emerging businesses."
 
The company also announced revenue of $32.19 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, a 13% increase over the $28.37 billion reported last year. Operating income was $13.22 billion, compared to $11.91 billion in the prior fiscal year. Net income for fiscal year 2003 was $9.99 billion and diluted earnings per share were $0.92, which included after-tax charges for investment impairments of $0.07, charges related to legal settlements of $0.06, and a one-time tax benefit of $0.01. For the previous year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $7.83 billion and $0.70, which included after-tax charges for investment impairments of $0.26, charges related to legal settlements of $0.04, and a gain on the sale of Expedia of $0.08.
Server Platforms had strong revenue growth of 17% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, fueled by 24% growth in Windows Server revenue and 34% growth in Microsoft SQL Server revenue. In addition, the company reported increasing demand for enterprise editions of its core server products, as customers continue to turn to Microsoft for their mission critical workloads. In the fourth quarter, Microsoft launched the Windows Server 2003 family of products, which is already seeing strong customer adoption. Customers acquiring Microsoft server software this quarter include Cendant Corporation, VeriSign, Inc., and the United States Army.
 
MSN turned in record revenue this quarter, with 25% growth over the comparable quarter in the previous year, driven by 48% growth in advertising revenue. "In the past year, we have made significant progress with both our performance based advertising and our brand advertising on the MSN network. With customers like Nestle, Visa, and Kraft, MSN is proving that it is a premier Internet location for advertisers," said Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of MSN. "Going forward, the MSN business will continue to focus on providing the best Internet experiences for consumers and advertisers, while maintaining our path toward profitability."
 
Home and Entertainment posted stronger than expected results in the fourth quarter, with 8% revenue growth over the prior year on higher than forecasted Xbox console sales. Since the launch of Xbox in 2001, Microsoft has sold over 9.4 million Xbox consoles worldwide, and by the end of the next fiscal year, Microsoft expects to have sold 14.5 to 16.0 million consoles. In addition, Xbox Live continued to gain momentum with over 500,000 subscribers worldwide participating in more than 1 million game sessions every week. There will be over 400 Xbox titles available for the 2003 holiday season, and there are several highly anticipated games coming out this fiscal year, including Halo 2.
 
Business Outlook
 
As noted with the new compensation plan announced on July 8, 2003, Microsoft will include equity compensation expense in financial statements beginning the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. Going forward, comparable period financial statements will reflect equity compensation expenses and will be consistent to the amounts reflected in FAS 123 disclosures provided in prior quarters.
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending September 30, 2003:

Revenue
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 was $8.07 billion, an increase of 11% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. The revenue growth was driven primarily by multi-year licensing for Information Worker and Server Platforms products along with 25% growth in MSN revenue.
 
Product Revenue
 
Microsoft's seven segments are: Client; Server Platforms; Information Worker; Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
includes revenue from Windows XP, Windows 2000, other standard Windows operating systems, Tablet PC, Windows Media Center Edition, and classic operating systems licensed for embedded systems (operating system software for use in devices other than PCs). Client revenue was $2.53 billion in the fourth quarter, increasing 4% compared to $2.43 billion in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The quarterly revenue growth was driven by a 2 percentage point increase to 62% of the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the OEM channel. Windows Professional revenue growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $201 million or 14% compared to the prior year fourth quarter, offset by a decline in other Windows operating systems.
Client
 
consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Total Server Platforms revenue grew 17% to $1.93 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $251 million or 21% from the prior year's fourth quarter as a result of increased new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $33 million or 14% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $1 million.
Server Platforms
 
consists of Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.35 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, increasing 8% from the prior year's fourth quarter. The growth in revenue was due to a $102 million or 5% increase in Office suites revenue associated with new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements and a $75 million or 32% increase in revenue from the combined total of Project, Visio, and other standalone applications.
Information Worker
 
includes Microsoft Great Plains; Navision; and bCentral. Business Solutions revenue for the fourth quarter was $179 million compared to $86 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. The acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year combined with the increase customer demand for Navision products accounted for $86 million of the increase.
Business Solutions
 
includes MSN Subscription and MSN Network services. MSN revenue totaled $559 million in the fourth quarter compared to $447 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. MSN Network services revenue grew $80 million or 48% as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions. The remainder of the quarterly growth was attributed to MSN Subscription revenue.
MSN
 
includes Pocket PC, SmartPhones, Handheld PC, other Mobility, Windows embedded device operating systems, and MapPoint. Fourth quarter revenue totaled $44 million, compared to $36 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing. Prior year revenue for Mobile and Embedded Devices has been restated to reflect the reorganizations of MapPoint from Information Worker and Windows embedded device operating systems from Client to Mobile and Embedded Devices.
Mobile and Embedded Devices
includes the Xbox video game system; PC games; consumer software and hardware; and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $483 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, increasing 8% from $448 million in the prior year's fourth quarter. Xbox revenue increased $32 million or 13% from the prior year's fourth quarter, primarily as a result of higher sales of Xbox games. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games increased 1% compared to a year ago.
Home and Entertainment
 
Distribution Channels
 
Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses, organizational licenses, online services and products, and retail packaged products. These distribution channels are aligned geographically with the exception of OEM customers, which are generally managed centrally.
 
The Company's three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the Americas Region, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (EMEA), and the Japan and Asia-Pacific Region. For fiscal year 2003, Microsoft reorganized the alignment of countries located in the South Pacific to be included as part of the Japan and Asia-Pacific region. Prior year geographic revenue has been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. Sales of organizational licenses and retail packaged products via these channels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers.
 
channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who pre-install Microsoft products, primarily on PCs. OEM revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.49 billion, up 6% from $2.34 billion in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002. The OEM revenue growth reflects a 5% increase in reported licenses, a 25% increase in Windows Professional revenue due to an increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional licenses, and 18% and 37% revenue growth for Office and Server products, respectively.
OEM
 
revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.99 billion, an increase of 3% compared to $2.91 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter. The Americas region revenue growth was primarily the result of 22% growth in MSN revenue and 25% growth in Business Solutions revenue. Revenue from Server Platforms increased 3%; however, Client and Information Worker revenue declined 4% and 7%, respectively.
Americas Region
 
revenue was $1.75 billion, increasing 43% from the $1.22 billion reported in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The revenue growth was aided by favorable foreign exchange rates compared to the prior year's fourth quarter exchange rates. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the fourth quarter of 2002, revenue in the region would have increased 27% instead of increasing 43%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses. Including the favorable foreign exchange rates, revenue growth in Information Worker and Server Platforms increased 39% and 37%, respectively. The acquisition of Navision in the first quarter of 2003 also led to a $70 million increase in fourth quarter revenue in the region for Business Solutions compared to the prior year's fourth quarter.
Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region
 
revenue increased 7% to $835 million from $780 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The region's revenue increase reflected a 42% increase in Home and Entertainment sales, primarily Xbox gaming consoles, and a 16% increase in Server Platforms revenue. Client and Information Worker revenue were flat with the prior year's fourth quarter. Had foreign exchange rates been constant with those of the fourth quarter of 2002, revenue in the region would have decreased 0.2% instead of increasing 7%, excluding any effects of hedging gains and losses.
Japan and Asia-Pacific Region
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's comparable quarter been in effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $255 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
Operating Expenses
 
was $1.24 billion, or 15.4% of revenue, in the fourth quarter, compared to $1.37 billion, or 18.9% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of the prior year. The decrease in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, resulted primarily from a 43% decrease in Home & Entertainment costs, due to fewer Xbox console units and lower costs of producing the Xbox console, partially offset by a 24% increase in program costs for Client, Information Worker, and Server Platforms.
Cost of revenue
 
expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $1.34 billion, 16.6% of revenue, an increase of 13% in absolute dollar terms over the fourth quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a $117 million or 15% increase in headcount-related costs and a $14 million or 56% increase in localization costs, primarily related to the upcoming launch of Office System 2003, and $21 million or 13% increase in third party product development costs, testing equipment, and lab expenses.
Research and development
 
expenses were $2.10 billion in the fourth quarter, or 26.1% of revenue, compared to $1.54 billion in the fourth quarter of the prior year, or 21.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to a 30% increase in marketing spending, including spending related to the Realizing Potential initiative, Windows Server System product launches, and the upcoming launch of Office System 2003, $38 million related to the integration of our Small/Medium and the Business Solutions sales forces, and $84 million of headcount-related expenses primarily associated with the additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium sales forces as well as additional sales bonuses commensurate with the growth in revenue.
Sales and marketing
 
costs were $1.19 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $284 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs in the fourth quarter included $750 million charge for the AOL Time Warner settlement and $46 million additional administrative costs associated with the settlement of the class action lawsuits.
General and administrative
 
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other incorporates Microsoft's share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other increased to $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, from $14 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2002.
 
The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32%.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
A portion of Microsoft's revenue from Enterprise Agreements, Software Assurance, Upgrade Advantage and other volume licensing programs is recorded as unearned revenue at the time of billing and recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Also, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including technical support and Internet browser technologies, is based on a range of average sales prices of those elements when sold separately, and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the product's life cycle. Product life cycles, determined to be the time period between when a product is released and when a new product in the same product family is expected to be released, are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications (primarily Office). The
percentage of revenue recorded as unearned and recognized ratably for undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 5% to 15% for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2003 increased $483 million from March 31, 2003 reflecting a sequential increase in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements partially offset by recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods. Of the $9.02 billion of unearned revenue at June 30, 2003, $2.65 billion is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, $2.05 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.53 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.00 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and $1.79 billion thereafter.
 
Financial Condition
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $49.05 billion as of June 30, 2003. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was $2.69 billion, compared to $3.43 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The decrease reflects a cash payment for the legal settlement with AOL Time Warner in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, an 18% decline in cash flow from accounts receivables, partially offset by an increase in new and recurring multi-year contract billings. Cash used for financing was $483 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to $3.84 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. This decrease in cash used from the prior year reflected a $2.91 billion decrease in cash used for stock repurchases, and a $445 million increase of common stock issuances primarily for employee stock option programs. The Company repurchased 48.1 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter, compared to 179.0 million shares repurchased in the prior year. Cash used for investing was $90 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $1.61 billion from the prior year reflecting lower investing activity in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
Employee Stock Options (ESOs)
 
The Company encourages broad-based employee ownership of Microsoft stock and has had an ESO program in which the majority of employees have been eligible to participate. At June 30, 2003, 1.55 billion vested and unvested options were outstanding, compared to 10.77 billion common shares outstanding.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2003, Microsoft followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25, , to account for ESOs, which generally does not require income statement recognition of options granted at the market price on the date of issuance. FICA and Medicare payroll taxes associated with stock option exercises are recorded as an expense. Other events such as the accelerated vesting of options can also trigger recording an expense. These costs were reflected in each operating expense line item in the income statement. Under SFAS 123, employee stock options are valued at grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and this compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Had compensation cost for our stock option and employee stock purchase plans been determined as prescribed by SFAS 123, pro forma income statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 would have been as follows:

(In millions, except earnings per share)(Unaudited)
 
 
In July 2003, the Company announced that it would adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on July 1, 2003 (fiscal year 2004) and restate prior periods to reflect the compensation cost that would have been recognized had the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 been applied to all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995.

Attached as an exhibit to this report are Microsoft Corporation's consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the twelve months ended June 30, 2001, 2002 and 2003 formatted in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language) 2.0 format. These documents are presented for illustration purposes only. These are not the official publicly filed financial statements of Microsoft Corporation. No representation is made that the information presented is accurate or complete and they are not to be used for investment purposes.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07. XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files included as part of this Form 8-K:

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $8.22 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2003, a six percent increase over $7.75 billion in the prior year. Operating income for the first quarter was $3.15 billion, compared to $3.03 billion reported in the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 were $2.61 billion and $0.24, which included equity compensation expense of approximately $680 million (after-tax) or $0.06 per share. For the previous year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $2.04 billion and $0.19, which included a charge for investment impairments of $291 million (after-tax) or $0.03 per share and equity compensation expense of approximately $702 million (after-tax) or $0.06 per share. Prior year operating income, net income, and earnings per share have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the adoption of fair value expense accounting for equity based compensation under SFAS 123.
Redmond, Wash.  Oct. 23, 2003 
 
"While corporate IT spending was slow to improve this quarter, we saw strength across all of our consumer businesses, driving higher than expected revenue for the company," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Delivering value to our customers with innovative software like the new Office System, Exchange Server 2003, and Small Business Server and executing on our plan to better help protect customers from a growing number of security attacks are our top priorities for the rest of the year."
 
Robust consumer demand for PCs during the back to school shopping season fueled better than expected Client revenue during the quarter. In addition, MSN had another strong quarter with over 50% advertising revenue growth, and Home and Entertainment revenue grew by 20%, driven by the successful launch of the Xbox holiday offering. Mobile and Embedded Devices also demonstrated momentum this quarter with revenue growing to $53 million on strong results from our Windows Mobile, MapPoint, and Windows Embedded products. Additionally, this week AT&T Wireless announced the availability of the Motorola MPx200, the first Windows Mobile-based Smartphone in North America.
Server and Tools grew a solid 15% over last year to $1.87 billion this quarter. Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange all experienced double digit revenue growth, driven by a growing number of customers acquiring high-end enterprise editions. Windows Server 2003 has sold over two times as many licenses as Windows 2000 Server over the same period of time since launch. In addition, with over 120 million seats sold worldwide, Exchange continues to be a leading messaging solution for companies.
 
This week, Microsoft launched the new Office System, with a pioneering new version of Outlook, built-in XML capabilities and several new applications including Microsoft Office InfoPath, Microsoft Office OneNote, and Microsoft Office Live Communications Server. "The new Microsoft Office System presents a clear opportunity for both small and large organizations to increase employee productivity and the value of business information. In addition, by introducing new editions of Office such as the Microsoft Office Small Business Edition 2003 and Microsoft Office Student & Teacher Edition 2003, we are answering customers' requests for products customized specifically for their needs," said Jeff Raikes, group vice president, Productivity and Business Services. Customers acquiring Office during the quarter included Accenture, Ace Hardware Corp., and Gold Kist, Inc.
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2003, which includes equity compensation expenses in accordance with SFAS 123:
 
 
 
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, which includes equity compensation expenses in accordance with SFAS 123:

Forward-Looking Statements
 
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: entry into markets with vigorous competition, market acceptance of new products and services, continued acceptance of existing products and services, changes in licensing programs, product price discounts, delays in product development and related product release schedules, and reliance on sole source suppliers for key components of Xbox that could result in component shortages and delays in product delivery, any of which may cause revenues and income to fall short of anticipated levels; obsolete inventory or product returns by distributors, resellers and retailers; warranty and other claims on hardware products such as Xbox; changes in the rate of PC shipments; technological shifts; the support of third party software developers for new or existing platforms; the availability of competitive products or services such as the Linux operating system at prices below our prices or for no charge; the ability to have access to MSN service distribution channels controlled by third parties; the risk of unanticipated increased costs for network services; the continued ability to protect the company's intellectual property rights; the ability to obtain on acceptable terms the right to incorporate in the company's products and services technology patented by others; changes in product and service mix; maturing product life cycles; product sale terms and conditions; the risk that actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues; the company's ability to efficiently integrate acquired businesses such as Navision a/s; implementation of operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; the financial condition of our customers and vendors; variations in equity compensation expenses under FAS 123, which will fluctuate based on factors such as the actual number of stock awards issued and the market
value of the awards on the dates of grant; unavailability of insurance; uninsured losses; adverse results in litigation; the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in our operations and security arrangements; continued softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software; currency fluctuations; trade sanctions or changes to U.S. tax law resulting from the World Trade Organization decision with respect to the extraterritorial income provisions of U.S. tax law; and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges.

Revenue
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was $8.22 billion, an increase of 6% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing for Server and Tools products along with 20% growth in Home and Entertainment revenue and 15% growth in MSN revenue.
 
Consolidated Operating Income
 
Operating income of $3.15 billion grew 4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. The growth in operating income reflected an increase of $469 million in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $349 million in operating expenses, primarily related to Home and Entertainment product costs, employee-related costs associated with additional headcount, and increased legal costs including certain settlement expenses.
 
Product Revenue
 
Microsoft's seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue was $2.81 billion in the first quarter, flat with revenue from the first quarter of the prior year, reflecting flat reported license growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company completed its transition to new licensing terms under which OEMs are billed for products when Certificates of Authentication (COAs) are acquired rather than upon PC shipment, resulting in reported licenses related to inventory accumulation.
Client
 
consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Total Server and Tools revenue grew 15% to $1.87 billion in the first quarter, driven in part by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and in part by growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $214 million or 18% from the prior year's first quarter as a result of revenue earned from previously billed multi-year licensing agreements and new server shipment sales. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $37 million or 16% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $10 million or 5%.
Server and Tools
 
includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, LiveMeeting, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 1% from the prior year's first quarter. Revenue for the quarter excluded $137 million of revenue deferred for technology guarantees provided to customers who purchased Office in first quarter of fiscal 2004. Revenue from OEM licensing of Office products grew 30% from the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
Information Worker
 
includes Microsoft Great Plains; Navision; and bCentral. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $128 million, a 21% increase compared to $106 million in the prior year's first quarter. The revenue increase of $22 million was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision products.
Microsoft Business Solutions
includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. MSN revenue totaled $491 million in the first quarter compared to $427 million in the prior year's first quarter. MSN Subscription revenue declined $17 million or 6% reflecting a decrease in the number of subscribers. MSN Network services revenue grew $81 million or 51% as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions.
MSN
 
includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. First quarter revenue totaled $53 million, compared to $28 million in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing.
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $581 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 20% from $485 million in the prior year's first quarter. Xbox revenue increased $53 million or 20% from the prior year's first quarter, with $85 million related to higher volumes of Xbox consoles, peripherals, and games offset by a $32 million decrease related to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games increased $43 million or 19% compared to a year ago.
Home and Entertainment
 
Foreign Currencies Impact
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the first quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's comparable quarter been in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $165 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Operating Expenses
 
The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Headcount-related costs in operating expenses include equity compensation. At September 30, 2003, 1.48 billion vested and unvested options were outstanding, compared to 10.81 billion common shares outstanding. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company granted stock awards for 57 million shares of stock, a significant portion of which are performance-based awards. The award of 57 million shares of stock under these awards is subject to vesting and, in the case of the performance-based stock awards, achievement of target performance over a three year period. Total equity compensation costs included in operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $1.02 billion, compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year's comparable quarter.
 
was $1.48 billion, or 18.0% of revenue, in the first quarter, compared to $1.34 billion, or 17.4% of revenue, in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, resulted primarily from a 27% increase in Home & Entertainment costs, due to increased Xbox console units sold partially offset by lower costs of producing the Xbox console and an 11% increase in product support and consulting services.
Cost of revenue
 
expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $1.61 billion, 19.6% of revenue, a decrease of 6% in absolute dollar terms over the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $62 million or 4% decrease in headcount-related costs, $20 million or 32% decrease in intellectual property rights amortization, and a $16 million or 14% decrease in third party product development costs.
Research and development
 
expenses were $1.51 billion in the first quarter, or 18.3% of revenue, compared to $1.42 billion in the first quarter of the prior year, or 18.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to a 22% increase in headcount-related expenses, primarily from additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium sales forces, partially offset by lower other sales expenses.
Sales and marketing
 
costs were $471 million in the first quarter compared to $252 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased in the first quarter primarily from higher legal costs including certain settlement costs and headcount-related expenses.
General and administrative
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other consists of Microsoft's share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other decreased to $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, from $22 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003. The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
Dividends and interest declined moderately, mainly due to the $62 million AT&T dividend earned in the prior comparable quarter and offset somewhat by higher interest income earned on investments.
 
Net gains (losses) on sales of investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $18 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $434 million in the first quarter of the prior year, which accounted for the majority of the increase to investment income.
 
Net gains attributable to derivative instruments were $34 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to losses of $347 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 which were driven mainly by the impact of decreasing interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments.
 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2003 decreased $768 million from June 30, 2003 reflecting a sequential decrease in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements, deferral of revenue associated with technology guarantees for Office System 2003, and recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods. Of the $8.25 billion of unearned revenue at September 30, 2003, $2.62 billion is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.95 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.38 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, $665 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and $1.63 billion thereafter.
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $51.62 billion as of September 30, 2003. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $3.42 billion, compared to $6.17 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The decrease reflects a $2.12 billion decline in cash flow from unearned revenue resulting from a decline in multi-year contract billings. Cash used for financing was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $2.96 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. This decrease in cash used from the prior year primarily reflected a $2.45 billion decrease in cash used for stock repurchases. The Company repurchased 43.3 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in the first quarter, compared to 120.6 million shares repurchased in the prior year. Cash used for investing was $3.75 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $2.85 billion from the prior year due to greater sales of investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

Revenue
 
Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 was $8.22 billion, an increase of 6% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing for Server and Tools products along with 20% growth in Home and Entertainment revenue and 15% growth in MSN revenue.
 
Consolidated Operating Income
 
Operating income of $3.15 billion grew 4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. The growth in operating income reflected an increase of $469 million in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $349 million in operating expenses, primarily related to Home and Entertainment product costs, employee-related costs associated with additional headcount, and increased legal costs including certain settlement expenses.
 
Product Revenue
 
Microsoft's seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue was $2.81 billion in the first quarter, flat with revenue from the first quarter of the prior year, reflecting flat reported license growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company completed its transition to new licensing terms under which OEMs are billed for products when Certificates of Authentication (COAs) are acquired rather than upon PC shipment, resulting in reported licenses related to inventory accumulation.
Client
 
consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Total Server and Tools revenue grew 15% to $1.87 billion in the first quarter, driven in part by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and in part by growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $214 million or 18% from the prior year's first quarter as a result of revenue earned from previously billed multi-year licensing agreements and new server shipment sales. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $37 million or 16% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $10 million or 5%.
Server and Tools
 
includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, LiveMeeting, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.29 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 1% from the prior year's first quarter. Revenue for the quarter excluded $137 million of revenue deferred for technology guarantees provided to customers who purchased Office in first quarter of fiscal 2004. Revenue from OEM licensing of Office products grew 30% from the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
Information Worker
 
includes Microsoft Great Plains; Navision; and bCentral. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the first quarter was $128 million, a 21% increase compared to $106 million in the prior year's first quarter. The revenue increase of $22 million was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision products.
Microsoft Business Solutions
includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. MSN revenue totaled $491 million in the first quarter compared to $427 million in the prior year's first quarter. MSN Subscription revenue declined $17 million or 6% reflecting a decrease in the number of subscribers. MSN Network services revenue grew $81 million or 51% as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions.
MSN
 
includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. First quarter revenue totaled $53 million, compared to $28 million in the prior year's first quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing.
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $581 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 20% from $485 million in the prior year's first quarter. Xbox revenue increased $53 million or 20% from the prior year's first quarter, with $85 million related to higher volumes of Xbox consoles, peripherals, and games offset by a $32 million decrease related to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games increased $43 million or 19% compared to a year ago.
Home and Entertainment
 
Foreign Currencies Impact
 
Translated international revenue is affected by foreign exchange rates. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the first quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's comparable quarter been in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $165 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Operating Expenses
 
The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Headcount-related costs in operating expenses include equity compensation. At September 30, 2003, 1.48 billion vested and unvested options were outstanding, compared to 10.81 billion common shares outstanding. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company granted stock awards for 57 million shares of stock, a significant portion of which are performance-based awards. The award of 57 million shares of stock under these awards is subject to vesting and, in the case of the performance-based stock awards, achievement of target performance over a three year period. Total equity compensation costs included in operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $1.02 billion, compared to $1.05 billion in the prior year's comparable quarter.
 
was $1.48 billion, or 18.0% of revenue, in the first quarter, compared to $1.34 billion, or 17.4% of revenue, in the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in absolute dollars, as well as percentage of revenue, resulted primarily from a 27% increase in Home & Entertainment costs, due to increased Xbox console units sold partially offset by lower costs of producing the Xbox console and an 11% increase in product support and consulting services.
Cost of revenue
 
expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $1.61 billion, 19.6% of revenue, a decrease of 6% in absolute dollar terms over the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a $62 million or 4% decrease in headcount-related costs, $20 million or 32% decrease in intellectual property rights amortization, and a $16 million or 14% decrease in third party product development costs.
Research and development
 
expenses were $1.51 billion in the first quarter, or 18.3% of revenue, compared to $1.42 billion in the first quarter of the prior year, or 18.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars due to a 22% increase in headcount-related expenses, primarily from additions to the Enterprise and Small/Medium sales forces, partially offset by lower other sales expenses.
Sales and marketing
 
costs were $471 million in the first quarter compared to $252 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased in the first quarter primarily from higher legal costs including certain settlement costs and headcount-related expenses.
General and administrative
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other consists of Microsoft's share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other decreased to $10 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, from $22 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003. The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
Dividends and interest declined moderately, mainly due to the $62 million AT&T dividend earned in the prior comparable quarter and offset somewhat by higher interest income earned on investments.
 
Net gains (losses) on sales of investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $18 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $434 million in the first quarter of the prior year, which accounted for the majority of the increase to investment income.
 
Net gains attributable to derivative instruments were $34 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to losses of $347 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 which were driven mainly by the impact of decreasing interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments.
 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2003 decreased $768 million from June 30, 2003 reflecting a sequential decrease in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements, deferral of revenue associated with technology guarantees for Office System 2003, and recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods. Of the $8.25 billion of unearned revenue at September 30, 2003, $2.62 billion is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.95 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.38 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, $665 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and $1.63 billion thereafter.
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $51.62 billion as of September 30, 2003. Cash flow from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $3.42 billion, compared to $6.17 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The decrease reflects a $2.12 billion decline in cash flow from unearned revenue resulting from a decline in multi-year contract billings. Cash used for financing was $350 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $2.96 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. This decrease in cash used from the prior year primarily reflected a $2.45 billion decrease in cash used for stock repurchases. The Company repurchased 43.3 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in the first quarter, compared to 120.6 million shares repurchased in the prior year. Cash used for investing was $3.75 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $2.85 billion from the prior year due to greater sales of investments in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
Attached as an exhibit to this report are Microsoft Corporation's consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the three months ended September 30, 2002 and 2003 formatted in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language). These documents are presented for illustration purposes only. These are not the official publicly filed financial statements of Microsoft Corporation. No representation is made that the information presented is accurate or complete and they are not to be used for investment purposes.
 
The information in this report shall not deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07. XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K:

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On January 22, 2004, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
The information in this report shall not deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced record revenue of $10.15 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2003, a 19% increase over $8.54 billion in the prior year. Operating income for the second quarter was $1.48 billion, compared to $2.23 billion in the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.55 billion and $0.14 per share. These results include stock based compensation expense of $2.17 billion (after-tax) or $0.20 per share, of which $1.48 billion (after-tax) or $0.14 per share related to the completion of the employee Stock Option Transfer Program. For the previous year, net income and earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.87 billion and $0.17 per share, including stock based compensation expense of $709 million (after-tax) or $0.07 per share, a $282 million (after-tax) or $0.03 per share charge for investment impairments, a $126 million or $0.01 per share tax benefit from the reversal of previously accrued taxes, and $141 million (after-tax) or $0.01 per share legal charge related to the state antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits.
Redmond, Wash.Jan. 22, 2004
 
"Consumer and corporate demand for PCs continued to exceed our expectations and resulted in solid double-digit revenue growth for Windows
XP and Office products," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "In the second quarter, the overall corporate IT market also began to show signs of a recovery, with increased demand for both desktop and server products. Going forward, we will continue to focus on driving broader customer adoption of our latest enterprise products, including Office 2003, Windows Server 2003, Exchange Server 2003, and Small Business Server 2003."
 
Information Worker revenue grew 27% over the prior year, as customers took advantage of the compelling value in the new Office System collaboration and productivity tools. Strong adoption of Office 2003 by consumers and small businesses drove sales in the retail and system builder channels to surpass expectations. Customers acquiring Office during the quarter included Eli Lilly and Company, Safeco Corporation, and Ticketmaster.
 
MSN
once again reported stronger than expected revenue growth of 19% over last year. "As MSN continues to invest in its growing businesses, we remain focused on achieving long term profitability," said Bruce Jaffe, chief financial officer of MSN. "A key factor in attaining that long-term goal will be the success of MSN's advertising business which achieved record revenue with 47% growth year over year, driven by strength in both traditional online and search-based advertising." This month, MSN also launched MSN Premium and the new MSN.com, which provides additional services for broadband customers as well as new opportunities for advertisers. MSN Premium is Microsoft's most comprehensive web service ever offered with advanced communication capabilities, security and protection features, and rich information services and productivity applications.
 
Home and Entertainment had a solid quarter driven by sales of Xbox
games and consoles. With over 400 games available, including 70 Live-enabled games, Xbox grew its U.S. cumulative game attach rate to 6.4, according to NPD Data. Since the launch of Xbox in 2001, Microsoft has sold over 13.7 million Xbox consoles worldwide and is on track to have sold 14.5 to 16.0 million consoles by the end of this fiscal year. In addition, Xbox Live momentum continued with subscribers growing to nearly 750,000, keeping the business on target to have one million subscribers by the end of the fiscal year.
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2004, which includes stock based compensation expenses in accordance with SFAS 123:

Certain statements made in this document, including the statements in the third paragraph of the Management Summary, are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and assumptions. The press release accompanying this document includes factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations.
 
Management Summary
 
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 was $10.15 billion, an increase of 19% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. The revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the recently launched Office 2003, increased licensing of Windows operating systems through OEMs and Server and Tools products, and 19% growth in MSN revenue.
 
During the second quarter, the continued strong PC shipment growth influenced our overall revenue growth. We estimate that total PC shipments grew 12% from the second quarter of the prior year reflecting strength in the consumer segment and notebook sales. We also observed an improvement in overall IT spending. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 13%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 19% in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the second quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's second quarter been in effect in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $312 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
For the full fiscal 2004, PC shipments are expected to grow at double digit rates. In the second half of the fiscal year, we expect PC market growth to be driven by both consumer and business demand for PCs. We believe the overall server hardware sector and IT spending outlook is improving. Our enterprise server products revenue results should be positively influenced by the continued shift to lower cost X86 server architecture. As a result, we expect overall server hardware shipment growth for fiscal 2004 to reach double digit growth with Windows Server operating systems licenses growing faster than the overall sector. We believe foreign exchange rates will stabilize during the second half of our fiscal year and we will continue to benefit from the U.S. dollar's position relative to the Euro and Japanese yen in the second half of the fiscal year.
 
Consolidated operating income of $1.48 billion declined 34% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 due primarily to $2.21 billion in stock based compensation expenses related to our employee stock option transfer program completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Increased marketing, legal costs, and employee-related costs associated with additional headcount also contributed to the increase in operating expenses.
 
Product Revenue
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue was $3.06 billion in the second quarter, growing 21% from the second quarter of the prior year. Windows OEM license units grew 27%, driving a 26% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. The mix of Windows units shipped with the Professional version remained steady at 55% of total Windows licenses compared to the prior year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed our transition to new licensing terms under which OEMs are billed for products when Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) are acquired rather than upon PC shipment,
Client
 
which resulted in reported licenses in the second quarter of the prior year to be unusually low as some OEMs accumulated inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew 4% compared to the prior year's second quarter. We anticipate that total PC shipments will grow at double digit rates for the rest of fiscal 2004, continuing to influence our growth in Client revenue. We do not expect any significant incremental shift toward our higher priced Windows Professional version.
 
consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Total Server and Tools revenue grew 21% to $2.13 billion in the second quarter. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $290 million or 22% driven primarily by an estimated 19% increase in Windows-based server shipments driving 17% growth in new Windows Server license sales as well as growth in SQL Server and Exchange Server revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $70 million or 29% compared to the prior year's second quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services grew $11 million or 5%.
Server and Tools
 
includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and professional product support services. Revenue from Information Worker was $2.90 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, increasing 27% from the prior year's second quarter. Revenue for the quarter included $137 million of revenue deferred from the first quarter of fiscal 2004 for rights to upgrade to Office 2003 provided to customers who purchased Office in first quarter. Revenue growth also included 36% growth in retail packaged product sales in part due to the release of the new Office 2003 during the second quarter. OEM licensing revenue from Office products and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan grew 22% from the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Contributing to the increase in revenue was a lower deferral rate for undelivered elements in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, which resulted in a higher proportion of revenue earned.
Information Worker
 
includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, bCentral and other business applications and services. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the second quarter was $190 million, a 41% increase compared to $135 million in the prior year's second quarter. The revenue increase of $55 million was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision products and Business Contact Manager.
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. MSN revenue totaled $546 million in the second quarter growing 19% from the second quarter of the prior year. MSN Network services revenue grew $93 million or 47% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. MSN subscription revenue declined $6 million or 2% as the number of subscribers continued to decline as our narrowband subscriber base continues to migrate to competitively priced broadband or other ISVs. Subscription revenue may decline for the remainder of the fiscal year as the overall MSN subscriber base is expected to continue to decline.
MSN
 
includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. Second quarter revenue totaled $63 million, compared to $38 million in the prior year's second quarter. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in all businesses. The strong revenue growth realized by MapPoint will attenuate in future quarters, as the present growth rate reflects the acquisition of Vicinity Corporation during the second quarter of the prior fiscal year.
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue was $1.27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, declining 5% from $1.33 billion in the prior year's second quarter. Xbox revenue increased $15 million or 2% from the prior year's second quarter, with $175 million related to higher volumes of Xbox software, offset by a $37 million decline due to lower Xbox console volumes and a $123 million decrease related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Xbox console volumes declined 6%.
Home and Entertainment
 
This decline primarily reflects a change in the timing of the introduction of our Xbox holiday offering, which in fiscal 2004 occurred in the first quarter and in fiscal 2003 occurred in the second quarter. Xbox's life to date U.S. games attach rate according to NPD data was 6.4 games per console with over 400 games available. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $78 million or 18% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2003 due to stronger sales of our PC games software titles in the prior year and a decline in revenue from PC gaming devices.
 
Operating Expenses
 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Headcount-related costs in operating expenses include stock based compensation.
 
In the second quarter of fiscal 2004, we completed an employee stock option transfer program with JPMorgan. In general, employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested outstanding stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher ("eligible options") to JPMorgan. The unvested eligible options that we transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. The price paid by JPMorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of Microsoft common stock during a contractually defined period from November 14, 2003 to December 8, 2003 which is referred to as the "averaging period."
 
The average closing price for our common stock during the averaging period was $25.5720. A total of 18,503 (51%) of the 36,539 eligible Microsoft employees elected to participate in the stock option transfer program. A total of 344.6 million (55%) of the 621.4 million eligible options were tendered. Under the terms of the program, JPMorgan paid Microsoft $382 million for the transferred options. Microsoft made an initial payment of $219 million to participating employees for the transferred options, with a remaining portion to be paid in one or more payments that are subject to participating employees' continued employment over the next two or three years. The options that were transferred to JPMorgan resulted in a stock based compensation expense of $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share). This expense consists of the unrecognized compensation costs of the options that were transferred, less the amounts payable applicable to those previously unvested options that are subject to continued employment of the participating employees entitled to receive contingent payments.
 
At December 31, 2003, 1.08 billion stock options were outstanding, compared to 10.79 billion common shares outstanding. The stock option figure includes vested and unvested employee stock options and includes the options transferred to JPMorgan.
 
Total stock based compensation costs, including the amounts related to the employee stock option transfer program, reflected in operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $3.23 billion, compared to $1.06 billion in the prior year's comparable quarter.
 
was $2.34 billion, or 23.1% of revenue, in the second quarter, compared to $2.14 billion, or 25.0% of revenue, in the second quarter of the prior year. The increase in absolute dollars resulted primarily from $215 million in stock based compensation expense associated with the employee stock option transfer program. The increase in absolute dollars in cost of revenue was partially offset by a 12% decrease in Home & Entertainment costs, due to a decrease in Xbox console units sold and lower costs of producing the Xbox console.
Cost of revenue
 
expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $2.97 billion, 29.3% of revenue, compared to $1.52 billion, 17.7% of revenue, in the second quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to $1.31 billion in stock based compensation expense associated with the employee stock option transfer program and $167 million or 14% increase in headcount-related costs.
Research and development
 
expenses were $2.47 billion in the second quarter, or 24.3% of revenue, compared to $2.16 billion in the second quarter of the prior year, or 25.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing costs
Sales and marketing
 
increased in absolute dollars due to $400 million in stock based compensation expense associated with the employee stock option transfer program and $17 million or 2% in higher marketing.
 
costs were $896 million in the second quarter compared to $497 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. General and administrative costs increased in the second quarter primarily from $280 million in stock based compensation expense and $19 million in fees and expenses associated with the employee stock option transfer program as well as higher legal costs including certain settlement costs and headcount-related expenses.
General and administrative
 
Non-operating Items, Investment Income, and Income Taxes
 
Losses on equity investees and other consists of Microsoft's share of income or loss from equity method investments and income or loss attributable to minority interests. Losses on equity investees and other decreased to $5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, from $12 million in the comparable quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
The components of Investment income are as follows:
 
 
Dividends and interest increased mainly due to the higher interest income earned on a larger investment portfolio, partially offset by $33 million of AT&T dividends earned in the prior comparable quarter.
 
Gains/(losses) on investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $43 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $421 million in the second quarter of the prior year. Realized gains from investments increased to $353 million, compared to $317 million in the second quarter of the prior year.
 
Gains on derivatives were $11 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to losses of $36 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. Excluding this reversal, the effective fiscal 2003 tax rate would have been 33%.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2003 decreased $395 million from September 30, 2003. The sequential decrease reflected a $76 million decrease in unearned revenue related to undelivered elements as deferral rates were lowered and product life cycles lengthened for the underlying products licensed in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 compared to fiscal 2003, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. The sequential decline also reflects the recognition of $137 million of previously deferred revenue associated with the rights to upgrade to Office 2003 and a net decrease of $210 million in unearned revenue from volume licensing programs as $296 million of revenue was earned from previously deferred revenue from Upgrade Advantage programs. Of the $7.85 billion of unearned revenue at December 31, 2003, $2.56 billion is expected to be recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.94 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, $1.08 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, $647 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, and $1.62 billion thereafter.
 
The revenue earned from the Upgrade Advantage programs for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 was as follows (in millions):
 
 
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $52.78 billion as of December 31, 2003. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 was $4.57 billion, compared to $2.77 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase reflects higher net income before stock based compensation expense, and other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $2.27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $571 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. This increase in cash used from the prior year primarily reflected the cash dividend payment of $1.73 billion. We also repurchased 30.5 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in the second quarter, compared to 38.8 million shares repurchased in the prior year. Cash used for investing was $1.95 billion in the second quarter, compared to $2.02 billion in the prior year.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International Web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07 ( available for download from the XBRL International Web site). XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $9.18 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, a 17% increase over $7.84 billion in the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter was $1.28 billion, compared to $2.74 billion in the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.32 billion and $0.12 per share. These results include stock-based compensation expense of $748 million (pre-tax) equating to $501 million (after-tax) or $0.05 per share, and legal charges of $2.53 billion (pre-tax) equating to $1.89 billion (after-tax) or $0.17 per share related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems Inc. litigation and a fine imposed by the European Commission. For the previous year, net income and earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.14 billion and $0.20 per share, including stock-based compensation expense of $978 million (pre-tax) equating to $655 million (after-tax) or $0.06 per share.
Redmond, Wash.April 22, 2004
 
"Broad-based demand and solid execution across all our businesses drove outstanding results for the quarter," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "All of our businesses met or exceeded our expectations this quarter with the Client, Information Worker and Server and Tools businesses growing a combined 17%. Overall corporate IT spending continued to improve and we expect to see healthy demand through the end of our fiscal year."
 
Information Worker revenue grew 18% over the prior year as Office experienced strong sales across all customer segments. Worldwide retail license sales of Office 2003 since its launch in October 2003 were double those of Office XP over its first five months. Office OEM sales grew 35% benefiting from increased adoption of Office 2003 including penetration of the Small Business and Professional editions. Customers acquiring Office during the quarter included Circuit City, Del Monte Foods, Perot Systems, The Thomson Corporation, and Unisys Corporation.
Server and Tools grew a solid 19% driven by healthy demand for Windows, Exchange, SQL Server, and Visual Studio products. Rapid customer adoption of Windows Server 2003 continued with new licenses growing 31%. "Windows Server 2003 is our most successful server operating system product ever with customer license sales doubling any previous version over a comparable period since launch," said Eric Rudder, senior vice president, Server and Tools business. "It is also rewarding to see customers and partners excited about the recently released Windows Small Business Server 2003 product, as is reflected by our early strong sales and already having 47,000 partners trained to deploy and service the platform."
 
MSN
reported another profitable quarter on robust revenue growth of 16% over last year driven by continued success in growing its advertising business. MSN advertising revenue increased 43% during the quarter, again showing strength in both traditional online and search-based advertising. Customers and advertisers continue to recognize MSN as a worldwide leader in online services with more than 350 million unique users to the MSN network, over 170 million active MSN Hotmail unique users, and more than 120 million active MSN Messenger unique users worldwide on a monthly basis.
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2004, which includes stock-based compensation expenses in accordance with SFAS 123:

Forward-Looking Statements
 
Statements in this release that are "forward-looking statements" are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: entry into markets with vigorous competition, market acceptance of new products and services, continued acceptance of existing products and services, changes in licensing programs, product price discounts, delays in product development and related product release schedules, and reliance on sole source suppliers for key components of Xbox that could result in component shortages and delays in product delivery, any of which may cause revenues and income to fall short of anticipated levels; obsolete inventory or product returns by distributors, resellers and retailers; warranty and other claims on hardware products such as Xbox; changes in the rate of PC shipments; technological shifts; the support of third party software developers for new or existing platforms; the availability of competitive products or services such as the Linux operating system at prices below our prices or for no charge; the ability to have access to MSN service distribution channels that are controlled by third parties; the risk of unanticipated increased costs for network services; the continued ability to protect the company's intellectual property rights; the ability to obtain on acceptable terms the right to incorporate in the company's products and services technology patented by others; changes in product and service mix; maturing product life cycles; product sale terms and conditions; the risk that actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues; implementation of operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; the financial condition of our customers and vendors; variations in equity compensation expenses under FAS 123, which will fluctuate based on factors such as the actual number of stock awards issued and the market value of the awards on the dates of grant; unavailability of insurance; uninsured losses; adverse results in litigation; the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in our operations and security arrangements; the level of corporate information technology spending and changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software; currency fluctuations; trade sanctions or changes to U.S. tax law resulting from the World Trade Organization decision with respect to the extraterritorial income provisions of U.S. tax law; and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges.

Third Quarter Summary
 
 
The revenue growth resulted primarily from increased licensing of Windows operating systems through OEMs, Office 2003 and Server products, and MSN advertising revenue. Foreign exchange rates also contributed nearly 5% growth in total revenue for the quarter due to generally stronger foreign currency rates versus the U.S. dollar.
 
During the third quarter, continued strong PC and Server shipment growth and improved IT spending compared to fiscal 2003 contributed to our overall revenue growth. We estimate that total PC shipments grew approximately 14% from the third quarter of the prior year driven by strong business demand in both mature and emerging markets with consumer shipments growth of approximately 10% for the quarter. Total server hardware shipments have grown 17% in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 per our internal projections, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 25% compared to the prior year's third quarter. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the third quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a stronger Euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's third quarter been in effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $350 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling, distribution, and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure.
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2004 decreased $326 million from December 31, 2003. Undelivered elements contributed $123 million of the net decrease in unearned revenue as deferral rates were lower, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. The decline also reflects a net decrease of $248 million in unearned revenue from volume licensing programs as $261 million of revenue was earned from Upgrade Advantage programs.
 
For the full fiscal 2004, we expect PC shipments to grow at rates in the low teens, driven by both consumer and business demand for PCs. We believe the overall server hardware sector and IT spending outlook will continue to demonstrate improvement over fiscal 2003. Our enterprise server products revenue results should be positively affected by the continued shift to lower cost X86 server architecture. As a result, we expect overall server hardware shipment growth for fiscal 2004 to reach near mid-teens growth with Windows Server operating systems licenses growing faster than the overall sector. We believe foreign exchange rates will continue to stabilize during the last quarter of our fiscal year and we will continue to benefit from the U.S. dollar's position relative to the Euro and Japanese yen.
 
The operating income decline for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was due primarily to a $1.92 billion charge related to settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and a 497 million ($605 million) accrual for the European Commission fine. Sun Microsystems and Microsoft entered into a series of agreements that settled Sun's suit against us and resolved other legal claims between the companies. The European Commission fine was imposed as part of its finding that Microsoft had infringed European competition law by refusing to supply work group server interoperability information and by including streaming media playback functioning in Windows desktop operating systems. We intend to appeal the European Commission's finding.
 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, , on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Equity compensation is included in operating expenses as part of headcount-related costs. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $748 million, compared to $978 million in the prior year's comparable quarter.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME/(LOSS)
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Certain corporate level expenses (primarily general and administrative expenses, including the accrual for the imposed fine from the European Commission, and corporate level sales and marketing costs) have been excluded.
 
Client
 
 
Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 Windows OEM license units grew 16%, driving an 18% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew 6% compared to the prior year's third quarter. The mix of Windows units shipped with the Professional version increased two percentage points to 58% of total Windows licenses compared to the prior year. Client operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 declined primarily as a result of $700 million of legal expenses related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation, partially offset by growth in revenue.
 
We anticipate that total PC shipments will grow about 10% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, continuing to influence our growth in Client revenue. Additionally, we do not expect significant future changes in the mix of Windows Home and the higher priced Windows Professional version.
 
Server and Tools
 
 
Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Server revenue, including CALs, grew $445 million or 36%. The revenue increase was driven primarily by an estimated 25% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 31% growth in new Windows Server license sales as well as growth in SQL Server and Core CAL revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $30 million or 11% compared to the prior year's third quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services decreased $125 million or 38%, due to recognition of $128 million of previously deferred revenue in the prior year's comparable quarter. The third quarter of fiscal 2004 operating income declined $940 million primarily due to $1.22 billion of legal expenses related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation, partially offset by the increase in revenue.
 
Information Worker
 
 
Information Worker includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and professional product support services. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 reflected continued momentum from the Office 2003 launch. Benefiting from increased adoption of Office 2003 including penetration of the premium Small Business and Professional editions, OEM licensing revenue grew 35% compared to the prior year's third quarter. Revenue from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan also grew 15% in aggregate as Office 2003 sales strength continued post launch. Contributing to the increase in revenue was previously deferred multi-year licensing arrangements revenue, including Upgrade Advantage, and a lower deferral rate for undelivered elements, partially offset by lengthened product lives. Information Worker operating income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased due to the growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily headcount-related costs and marketing expenses in the Small and Mid-Market Solutions and Partners group.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
 
Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, bCentral and other business applications and services. The revenue increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision and Axapta products outside of the United States as well as the timing of licensing agreements. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 declined due to growth in revenue and lower stock-based compensation expense partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs.
 
MSN
 
 
MSN includes MSN subscriptions and the MSN network of Internet products and services. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, MSN Network services revenue grew $100 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. MSN subscription revenue declined $17 million or 6% as the number of narrowband subscribers continued to migrate to competitively priced broadband or other ISPs. The number of total MSN subscriptions at the end of March 2004 was 8.2 million, slightly higher than at the end of December 2003, as the loss of narrowband subscribers was offset by the gain of other premium service subscriptions. Subscription revenue may decline in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as the narrowband subscriber base is expected to continue to decline. The improvement in operating income/(loss) in the third quarter was due to strong advertising revenue and paid search, while operation costs remained flat and customer acquisition expenditures declined.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The increase in revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was driven by growth in all businesses. The revenue growth realized by MapPoint has slowed and is expected to grow at a continued slower pace in future quarters, as the first two quarters of fiscal 2004 growth rates reflected the acquisition of Vicinity Corporation toward the end of the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss was lower in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year's third quarter, due to lower operating expenses and growth in revenue.
 
Home and Entertainment
 
 
Home and Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Xbox revenue increased $81 million or 35% from the prior year's third quarter, with $78 million related to higher volumes of Xbox software and $39 million due to higher Xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $36 million decline related to past price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2004, we announced a price reduction for the Xbox console in the United States. Overall, Xbox console volumes increased 30% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's comparable quarter. This increase was partially attributed to low inventory levels of competitive consoles. Xbox's life to date U.S. games attach rate according to NPD data was 6.8 games per console. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV Platforms declined $4 million or 2% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2003 due to lower PC games software and PC gaming devices sales.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 improved from the third quarter of fiscal year 2003 driven by revenue growth and improved Xbox console and third party software margins as well as lower marketing costs.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Cost of revenue
 
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The increase in absolute dollars in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 resulted from an increase in product support and consulting services costs and Home & Entertainment costs related to increased Xbox console units sold, partially offset by lower costs of producing the Xbox console.
 
Research and development
 
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. The decrease in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower headcount-related costs driven by reductions in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increased product development costs.
 
Sales and marketing
 
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Sales and marketing costs increased in absolute dollars in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 due to marketing programs targeted toward the Small and Mid-Market Solutions and Partners group and $117 million or 13% growth in headcount-related costs.
 
General and administrative
 
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount, and legal costs and other administrative fees. General and administrative in the third quarter included $1.92 billion of charges related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation as described in the segment information and a $605 million accrual for the European Commission fine.
 
INVESTMENT INCOME
 
The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
Dividends and interest income was relatively consistent for the comparable quarter. Net gains (losses) on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $234 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions. Realized gains from investments increased to $424 million compared to $236 million in the third quarter of the prior year.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 is approximately 42%. The increase in the effective tax rate for the third quarter reflects the impact of the accrual for the European Commission fine, which is not tax deductible. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
 
Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, , using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, . Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid-in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On our balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $56.41 billion, equity and other investments were $15.16 billion and we have no debt as of March 31, 2004.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of March 31, 2004 decreased $326 million from December 31, 2003. The sequential decrease reflected a $123 million net decrease in unearned revenue related to undelivered elements as deferral rates were lower, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. The sequential decline also reflects a net decrease of $248 million in unearned revenue from volume licensing programs as $261 million of revenue was earned from previously deferred revenue from Upgrade Advantage programs.
 
Of the $7.53 billion of unearned revenue at March 31, 2004, the following table outlines the expected recognition of this balance:
 
 
The revenue earned from the Upgrade Advantage programs for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 was as follows:
 
 
Cash Flow
 
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 was $4.97 billion, compared to $4.17 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The increase reflects higher net income before non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense and legal charges, and other changes in working capital. Cash used for financing was $1.04 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $1.21 billion in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Cash used in the prior year's comparable quarter included a cash dividend payment of $857 million. We also repurchased 49.9 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 30.7 million shares repurchased in the prior year's third quarter. Cash used for investing was $738 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $4.21 billion in the prior year's third quarter. The decrease reflects the decline in purchases of investments partially offset by impact of other investing activities.
 
Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 will be affected by the cash payment of certain legal charges accrued in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Reconciliation Of Differences Between GAAP And Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
We may from time to time discuss this quarter's performance using the non-GAAP financial measures presented below. The following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures presented below and the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
The non-GAAP measures provided above, which remove the Sun settlement, the accrual for the fine imposed by the European Commission and stock-based compensation expense from the most directly comparable GAAP measures, are included as an additional clarifying item to aid readers of the financial statements in further understanding the Company's quarterly performance and the impact that certain items and events had on the financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures provided above should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.2
 
Portions of Microsoft Fiscal Year 2004 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call, Thursday, April 22, 2004, 2:30 PM PDT  comments of Scott Di Valerio, Corporate Vice President and Corporate Controller
 
At this time I will provide an overview on the quarter and highlight a few significant financial and business momentum points. All growth comparisons that I mention relate to the third quarter of last year, unless otherwise specified.
 
From a revenue perspective, we had a strong quarter with net revenue up 17 percent to $9.2 billion, with nearly all of our seven business segments exceeding expectations and growing double digits. Better than expected OEM sales of Windows XP, continued strength in sales of Office 2003, strong demand for Server products, healthy Xbox console and software sales and higher MSN advertising revenue contributed to our overall excellent performance.
 
We continue to receive a benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates, primarily driven by the weakened U.S. dollar, however, the impact was generally in line with the guidance we gave you in January. Had rates been constant with the prior year, revenue would have been approximately $350 million lower.
 
We estimate that total PC unit growth was about 14 percent, driven by strong business demand in both mature and emerging markets. Total server hardware units grew about 17 percent, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall market at 25 percent.
 
Total operating expenses came in at $7.9 billion, including $748 million of stock-based compensation expense. G&A costs were higher than expected due to $2.5 billion of legal charges resulting from the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation and the accrual related to the European Commission fine.
 
Operating income decreased 53 percent to $1.3 billion, primarily due to the legal expenses I just discussed.
 
Investment income totaled $1 billion, higher than our guidance primarily due to higher realized gains resulting from generally improved market conditions.
 
Net income for the quarter was $1.3 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $0.12, including $0.17 related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the accrual related to the European Commission fine, and $0.05 in stock-based compensation.
 
Recognition of revenue related to annuity licensing agreements during the quarter accounted for approximately 24 percent of total revenue. This compares to 26 percent in the prior year and 22 percent in the second quarter of this year.
 
Now let me take a minute to provide some color around PC demand. We estimate that total PC unit shipments worldwide grew about 14 percent during the quarter. The U.S., EMEA and Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, all showed low to mid double-digit growth. Japan and Latin America grew in the mid to high single-digit range. We continue to see strong unit growth in emerging markets where a greater percentage of PCs ship with pirated copies of our products or without a Microsoft operating system. As a result, growth in underlying PC unit shipments does not always correlate directly with our operating system license growth numbers.
Now let's get to the business segment results.
 
Client revenue grew 16 percent to $2.9 billion, driven by stronger than expected PC shipments. Windows OEM license units grew 16 percent which drove 18 percent growth in OEM revenue. The difference between OEM unit growth and revenue growth was driven principally by a 2 point increase in the mix of professional versions of Windows up to 58 percent as we experienced strong business PC shipments.
 
Revenue from commercial and retail licensing grew less than the OEM channel as customers purchased or upgraded their operating systems through the purchase of a new PC.
 
During the quarter, Client operating income declined 16 percent, primarily as a result of the $700 million charge related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation.
 
Revenue from Server and Tools grew 19 percent to $2.2 billion driven by healthy demand for Windows Server, Exchange, SQL Server and Visual Studio products. Rapid customer adoption of Windows Server continued with new licenses growing 31 percent compared to the prior year. Similar to previous quarters, we saw strong growth in Server OEM sales.
 
Our consulting and premier product support businesses grew 11 percent. Revenue from developer tools, training and certification and MS Press businesses decreased 38 percent due to the recognition of $128 million of previously deferred revenue in Q3 of the prior year.
 
Server and Tools had an operating loss of $940 million, primarily due to a charge related to settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation of approximately $1.2 billion.
 
Information Worker revenue was up 18 percent this quarter to $2.7 billion, as Office experienced strong sales across all customer segments. During the quarter, OEM licensing revenues grew 35 percent and revenue from preinstalled versions of Office 2003 in Japan, volume licensing, and retail packaged products grew an aggregate of 15 percent.
 
Information Worker operating income improved 14 percent during the quarter, primarily due to the increase in revenue.
 
Revenue from Microsoft Business Solutions was $153 million, up 4 percent, primarily due to continued growth in licensing the Navision products outside the United States. We continue to focus our efforts on delivering high value products to our customers and improving our execution across the board.
 
The operating loss from Microsoft Business Solutions improved 29 percent on lower operating expenses.
MSN reported another profitable quarter with improved margins as well as better than expected revenue growth of 16 percent. MSN advertising revenue increased 43 percent during the quarter, again showing strength in both traditional online and search-based advertising.
 
Revenue in the subscription side of the business decreased about 6 percent year over year as the business continues to see a decline in its narrowband subscriber base. The subscription number ended up slightly above the December quarter at 8.2 million as the loss of narrowband subscribers was offset by the gain of Internet services and Hotmail extra storage subscriptions.
 
Revenue in Mobile and Embedded Devices grew at 33 percent to $61 million on strong growth across all our businesses. Additionally, upcoming Windows Mobile based Smartphones like Motorola MPx and MPx100 generated tremendous enthusiasm at the 3GSM conference in February. We released Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition Software during the quarter as we continue to improve the software experience on mobile devices.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss improved 47 percent due to lower operating expenses.
 
Now turning to Home and Entertainment, revenues increased 17 percent to $530 million. Xbox console volumes increased 30 percent over the same quarter last year. In the U.S., March NPD data showed that Xbox market share has increased 8 percentage points from 22 percent in March 2003 to 30 percent in March 2004. The Xbox business continues to execute with steady console growth, strong software sales, increasing numbers of subscribers using our Xbox Live gaming service and the highest U.S. attach rate of any console after just over two years in the market at 6.8.
 
Operating loss for the third quarter improved 25 percent driven by revenue growth and improved Xbox console and third party software margins.
 
Moving on to the rest of the income statement:
 
Cost of revenue increased slightly to $1.4 billion due to the higher cost of services as well as the higher volume of Xbox consoles.
 
The balance of operating expenses increased $2.7 billion, primarily due to charges related to the settlement of the Sun Microsystems litigation, accrual for the European Commission fine and other legal expenses. Sales and marketing came in about where we expected and R&D was a bit below our guidance due to lower headcount related costs.
 
Operating income was $1.3 billion, including the legal expenses, which were partially offset by stronger than expected revenue.
 
Investment income of $1.0 billion increased significantly from the third quarter of 2003 due to improved market conditions, resulting in higher gains on the sales of investments and significantly lower impairments.
 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 42 percent, reflecting the non-deductibility of the European Commission fine.
Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet.
 
Cash flow from operations increased 19 percent to $4.9 billion reflecting strong revenue and changes to working capital. During the quarter we spent approximately $1.4 billion to repurchase nearly 50 million shares.
 
Accounts receivable decreased $671 million sequentially, consistent with seasonal trends. DSO was at 51 days, compared to 49 days in the prior year March quarter. As we usually point out, our DSO computation includes changes in unearned revenue and the average sales number so it is consistent with what is included in receivables.
 
Other current liabilities increased $2.5 billion, primarily as a result of the accrual for the settlement of legal claims with Sun Microsystems and InterTrust. The $440 million InterTrust settlement involved a combination of a license of IP assets valued at $266 million and a payment of $174 million for past infringement. This settlement is reflected in our financial results and do not impact the income statement because it was partially funded through insurance.
 
Unearned revenue was down sequentially $326 million to $7.5 billion, slightly better than our forecast. Annuity billings showed year over year growth, driven primarily by new Enterprise Agreements signed with large corporations. License only billings were stronger than we anticipated, partially driven by continued momentum for Office 2003 and strong demand for our Server products.
 
The Upgrade Advantage contract amortization during the quarter was $261 million compared to $296 million in the December 2003 quarter and $450 million in the prior year March quarter.
 
The undelivered element portion of unearned revenue decreased by $123 million, due to the reduction in our product deferral rates for Windows and Office during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. We expect the undelivered elements portion of unearned revenue to continue to decrease as the lower deferral rates add to the account at a slower rate than the current period recognition.
 
Contracted but unbilled revenue increased sequentially and remains over $6 billion as customers continue to buy or renew Enterprise Agreements, consistent with the previous few quarters.
 
Finally, I'd like to point out our average diluted weighted shares outstanding were 10.86 billion, right about where we expected. We continue to actively manage share dilution through our various buyback programs.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International Web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07 ( available for download from the XBRL International Web site). XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K:

Item 12. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On Thursday, July 22, 2004, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended June 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
The information in this report shall not deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $9.29 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, a 15% increase over revenue of $8.07 billion for the same period in the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $3.13 billion, which included stock-based compensation expense of $739 million (pre-tax). This compares to operating income of $1.54 billion for the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, which included stock-based compensation expense of $665 million (pre-tax) and charges of $796 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the settlement of the Time Warner lawsuit. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2.69 billion including a $208 million tax benefit from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. This compares to net income of $1.48 billion reported in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.25 which included after-tax charges of $0.05 in stock-based compensation expense and a $0.02 tax benefit from the reversal of previously accrued taxes.

The company also announced revenue of $36.84 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, a 14% increase over the $32.19 billion reported last year. Net income for fiscal year 2004 was $8.17 billion and diluted earnings per share were $0.75, which included after-tax charges for stock-based compensation expense of $0.35, charges of $0.17 related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and a fine imposed by the European Commission, and a tax benefit of $0.02. For the previous fiscal year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $7.53 billion and $0.69, which included after-tax charges of $0.23 for stock-based compensation expense, charges for investment impairments of $0.07, charges related to legal settlements of $0.06 and a tax benefit of $0.01.
 
"We had a great quarter with 15% revenue growth as all of our businesses met or exceeded our expectations and our progress on cost efficacy delivered higher operating margins
 
overall," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Fiscal 2004 was a banner year  revenue grew 14% on strong performances from each of our seven businesses, our emerging business operating margins improved, and we resolved a significant portion of our legal exposure. Entering into the new fiscal year, we announced our intention to provide up to $75 billion in value to shareholders over the next four years and we're confident that we'll continue to grow through innovation and delivering value to our customers."
 
Server and Tools grew 20% compared to the prior fourth quarter. The record-level of revenue was driven by broad platform strength, including 20% growth in new Windows Server license units and increasing demand for enterprise editions of the company's core server products. Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange enjoyed revenue growth rates of over 20%. "Fueled by strong demand for Windows Server 2003, we saw broad strength across our server products, including Small Business Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Exchange," said Kevin Johnson, Group Vice President Worldwide Sales Marketing and Services.
 
Information Worker revenue grew 23% compared to the previous fourth quarter as momentum for the Microsoft Office System of products continued across all customer segments due to strength in volume licensing and OEM sales. Customers acquiring Microsoft Office during the quarter included JDS Uniphase Corporation, The World Bank and Xerox Corporation.
 
MSN posted its first-ever profitable year, moving from a $567 million loss in fiscal year 2003 to a $121 million operating profit in fiscal year 2004, a turnaround of almost $690 million which underscores the strength of the company's focus on its best of breed advertising platform and improved operational efficiency. "We are very proud of our hard work and the progress we've made in MSN. We've been able to drive our business to profitability while continuing to invest in making the MSN customer experience the best on the Web," said David Cole, senior vice-president of MSN and personal services division.
 
Earlier this week, the company announced that its board of directors approved an $0.08 per share quarterly dividend, plans to buy back up to $30 billion of the company's stock over the next four years, and a special one-time dividend of $3.00 per share. The payment of the special
 
dividend is subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee stock-based compensation awards to offset the impact of the special one-time dividend.

Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year Summary
 
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The revenue growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from increased licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs, increased licensing of Office, Windows Server operating system and other server applications, and increased MSN advertising revenue. Foreign exchange rates also contributed approximately 3% growth in total revenue for the quarter due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar.
 
During the fourth quarter, continued strong PC and server shipment growth and improved IT spending compared to fiscal 2003 contributed to our overall revenue growth. We estimate that total PC shipments grew approximately 12% from the fourth quarter of the prior year driven by strong business demand in both mature and emerging markets. Consumer shipments grew approximately 8% for the quarter. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, with Windows-based server shipments growing faster than the overall sector with 18% growth compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, primarily due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year's fourth quarter been in effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $273 million lower. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposures.
 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased $1.59 billion from the prior year's fourth quarter as a result of $1.23 billion growth in revenue and a decline in operating expenses as the prior year's fourth quarter included a $796 million charge primarily related to the settlement of the Time Warner lawsuit.
 
Total unearned revenue as of June 30, 2004 was $8.18 billion, an increase of $651 million from March 31, 2004, reflecting a net increase in new and recurring multi-year licensing agreements. The increase in multi-year licensing agreements was partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred revenue, including recognition from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements, and a $143 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Our revenue growth for fiscal 2004 was driven by strong licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs, Window Server operating systems, Office, and other server applications as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments and the impact from multi-year licensing that occurred prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 program in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We estimate growth in PC shipments was 13% during fiscal 2004, reflecting global economic improvement, which led to strength in the consumer segment in the first half of 2004 and to replacement PC and notebook sales in the enterprise segment in the second half of 2004. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16%, with Windows-based server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 18% in fiscal 2004. Prior to the July 31, 2002 Licensing 6.0 transition date, we experienced a significant increase in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in the Company's maintenance programs, primarily Upgrade Advantage. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal 2004, primarily due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year been
 
in effect in fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $1.10 billion lower. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposures.
 
For fiscal 2004, the operating income decline of $511 million was primarily caused by the $2.53 billion of charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and a fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to a $796 million charge primarily related to the settlement of the Time Warner lawsuit in fiscal 2003 and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program. Operating income was positively influenced by the revenue growth described above and operational improvements in our MSN business.
 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, , on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in operating expenses as part of headcount-related costs. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $739 million, compared to $665 million in the prior year's comparable quarter. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses were $5.73 billion in fiscal 2004, including $2.21 billion associated with the option transfer program in the second quarter, and $3.75 billion in fiscal 2003.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
 
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2004 decreased $838 million from June 30, 2003, reflecting recognition of previously deferred multi-year licensing agreements, including $1.14 billion from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements, and a $489 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, partially offset by new multi-year licensing agreements. Beginning April 1, 2003, revenue deferred for undelivered elements reflected lower deferral rates, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned.
 
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Certain corporate level expenses (primarily general and administrative expenses, including the accrual for the European Commission fine, and corporate level research and development and sales and marketing costs) have been excluded.
 
Client
 
 
Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client segment revenue growth is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, Windows Client OEM license units grew 13%, contributing to a 16% growth in OEM revenue compared to the prior year. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 12% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. The mix of Windows Client units shipped with a Premium edition increased 2 percentage points to 64% of total Windows Client licenses compared to the prior year. Premium edition products which include Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition and Tablet PC have a higher price than the standard Client operating systems such as Windows XP Home operating system. Client operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 increased primarily as a result of revenue growth driven by strong corporate demand for PCs and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Operating expenses increased 5% due to higher research and development costs and localization costs in fiscal 2004, partially offset by higher product marketing costs in the prior year's comparable quarter.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
For the full fiscal year, Client revenue increase was driven by 14% growth in OEM licenses and 16% growth in OEM revenue on strong growth in consumer PC unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and strong growth in business PC unit shipments in the second half of fiscal 2004. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 4% due to lower revenue earned from
 
Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and lower packaged product sales. Client operating income was flat compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased operating expenses primarily related to the Sun Microsystems settlement of $700 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $307 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, offset by growth in revenue.
 
Server and Tools
 
 
Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Growth in the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software, is the principal driver for Server and Tools revenue growth. The segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Products are sold through OEMs, distributors, direct to customers, and through one time licenses or multi-year volume licensing agreements.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimate overall server hardware shipments grew 16% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Server and Server applications revenue, including CALs, grew $332 million or 23% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. This revenue increase was driven primarily by an estimated 18% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 20% growth in new Windows Server licenses as well as growth in SQL Server and Core CAL revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $52 million or 19% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services decreased $3 million or 1% due to a shift to lower revenue generating online training tools from retail computer training books. Server and Tools revenue growth was positively impacted by foreign exchange rates contributing approximately $95 million or 5% of total revenue growth. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 operating income increased due to growth in revenue driven by strong demand in the Server hardware market, partially offset by operating expense growth resulting from higher consulting and product support services costs and sales and marketing costs.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
We estimate overall server hardware shipments grew 16% in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year. Server and server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.28 billion or 25% driven primarily by an estimated 18% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 15% growth in new Windows Server licenses. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $189 million or 19% compared to fiscal 2003. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services declined $128 million or 14% compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to recognition of previously deferred revenue in the prior year. Foreign exchange rates contributed approximately $350 million or 5% of total Server and Tools revenue growth. Server and Tools operating income for fiscal 2004 declined primarily due to the charge for the Sun Microsystems settlement of $1.22 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $651 million of stock-based compensation costs from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Information Worker
 
 
Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services and solutions designed to increase personal, team and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and
 
professional product support services. The majority of revenue comes from licensing Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker segments such as document lifecycle and collaboration.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 reflected continued momentum from the Office 2003 launch, including OEM licensing revenue growth of 20% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Revenue from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan grew 23% in aggregate driven by Office 2003 sales. The positive effect of foreign exchange rates contributed approximately $125 million or 5% to the total Information Worker revenue growth. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was previously deferred multi-year licensing agreements revenue, including Upgrade Advantage, and lower deferral rates, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned.
 
Information Worker operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased due to the growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily headcount-related costs and marketing expenses in the Small and Mid-Market Solutions and Partners group.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Revenue growth for fiscal 2004 from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre installed versions of Office in Japan was 15% in aggregate. This increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 programs and approximately $110 million related to the launch of Office 2003. OEM licensing revenue grew 29% or $325 million. Foreign exchange rates provided approximately $485 million or 5% of total Information Worker revenue growth. Information Worker operating income in fiscal 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to $351 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and higher sales and marketing costs.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
 
Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, MBN/Retail Manager and other business applications and services. MBS revenue is generally derived from developing and marketing integrated, end-to-end business applications and services designed to help small and mid-market businesses. The small and mid-market business applications market is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors. MBS revenue is affected by the general economic environment and information technology spending in particular.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The revenue increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, and Microsoft CRM products outside of the United States as well as strengthening sales of Microsoft CRM in the United States. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 declined primarily because the prior year's fourth quarter contained expenses related to the realignment of certain R&D organizations.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
The revenue increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Microsoft Navision and Microsoft Axapta products. The operating loss for fiscal 2004 declined from fiscal 2003 due to the increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including $42 million of lower amortization costs, partially offset by $27 million in stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
MSN
 
 
The MSN segment includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and information services, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment including MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services and MSN Mobile services. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services and from subscribers to MSN Internet Access, primarily narrowband.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 MSN advertising revenue grew $85 million or 35% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions (excluding Internet access) increased $28 million as MSN's premium services and software continue to gain traction in the market. Internet access revenue declined $84 million or 28% as the number of narrowband subscribers continued to migrate to broadband or competitively priced ISPs. At the end of the current fiscal year, MSN had 4.3 million Internet access subscribers compared to 6.5 million at the end of the prior fiscal year and 8.8 million total subscribers compared to 8.6 million at the end of the prior year. In addition, MSN has 350 million unique users, 187 million active MSN Hotmail accounts and 135 million active MSN Messenger accounts. The operating income in the fourth quarter improved from a loss in the prior year's fourth quarter due to strong advertising and paid search revenue, while operating costs remained flat and customer acquisition expenditures declined.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
In fiscal 2004 MSN advertising revenue increased $360 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. This increase was partially offset by a decline of $168 million or 15% in Internet access revenue, primarily from the migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced ISPs. Revenue from subscription and transaction services other than Internet access increased $71 million in 2004 to $95 million. MSN reached segment profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and was profitable for the full fiscal year. The improvement in profitability was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from advertising, in both display and paid search, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet access business, efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses, and a $48 million refund of prior year taxes, partially offset by $144 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The segment's products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile phones and Pocket PCs. The segment is also responsible for managing sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunications, cable and wireless companies and host and network equipment providers. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles which affect our continuing revenue streams.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 resulted from growth in all businesses. The revenue growth realized by MapPoint slowed, as the first two quarters of fiscal 2004 growth rates reflected the acquisition of Vicinity Corporation toward the end of the second quarter of the prior fiscal year. Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss was lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, due to growth in revenue and lower operating expenses.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Unit volume increases drove revenue growth for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 in all product lines. The growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of OEMs and mobile operators shipping Windows Mobile software for SmartPhones, increases in share for our Pocket PC and embedded products and increased usage by existing customers of our MapPoint On Line Service. MED's operating loss for fiscal 2004 decreased compared to fiscal 2003 due to growth in revenue partially offset by increased operating expenses, primarily related to $58 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Home and Entertainment
 
 
Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The relative success of competing video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the relative market share of the console. Microsoft is a relatively new entrant in the video game console business with its first release in fiscal 2002, but has established itself as one of the leaders. Revenue and units have grown quickly since 2002, but revenue growth has moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this stage in the console lifecycle. We believe that our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, providing higher margins to offset the decreasing price trend on consoles sold.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Xbox revenue decreased $5 million or 2% from the prior year's fourth quarter, with a $51 million decline related to past price reductions of Xbox consoles and software, offset by $32 million related to higher Xbox console volumes and $14 million due to higher volumes of Xbox software. Overall, Xbox console volumes increased 27% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This increase was partially attributed to increased demand for the console following the price reduction implemented at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Xbox's life to date U.S. games attach rate according to NPD data was 6.9 games per console. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV Platforms increased $21 million or 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 due to a new release of Mac Office, partially offset by the company's exit of the gaming devices and home networking businesses. Home and Entertainment operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 increased from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 due primarily to inventory adjustments of $94 million, reflecting the current stage in the lifecycle of the Xbox console.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
In fiscal 2004, Xbox revenue increased $144 million or 9% with $269 million related to higher Xbox software volumes and $117 million due to higher Xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $242 million decline related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Overall, Xbox console volumes increased 11% in 2004 compared to 2003. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $16 million or 1% compared to fiscal 2003 due to lower PC games software and PC gaming devices sales, partially offset by the new release of Mac Office.
 
The increase in operating loss in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $141 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and increased sales of negative margin consoles and costs associated with the next generation console development efforts, partially offset by increased Xbox and Mac Office software sales.
 
OPERATING EXPENSES
 
Cost of revenue
 
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The increase of $177 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 resulted from increased product support and consulting services costs of $94 million, higher Home and Entertainment costs related to $94 million in inventory adjustments for the Xbox console, partially offset by lower MSN services costs. The cost of revenue growth of $657 million in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased product support and consulting services costs of $508 million and $214 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, partially offset by lower MSN services costs.
 
Research and development
 
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. The decrease in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily due to lower product development and internal computer lab costs compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $1.31 billion of stock-based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and other headcount-related costs related to a 3% growth in research and development headcount from fiscal 2003, partially offset by lower product development and internal computer lab costs.
 
Sales and marketing
 
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Sales and marketing costs increased $121 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to marketing programs targeted toward the Small and Mid-Market Solutions and Partners group, growth in headcount-related costs and additional sales bonuses commensurate with the growth in revenue. Sales and marketing costs increased $747 million in fiscal 2004 due to $400 million of stock-based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and growth in headcount-related costs related to a 9% growth in sales and marketing headcount.
 
General and administrative
 
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount, and legal costs and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs in the fourth quarter decreased compared to a year ago as the prior year's fourth quarter included a $796 million charge primarily related to the settlement of the Time Warner lawsuit. General and administrative costs increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to legal expenses, including $1.92 billion of charges related to the Sun
 
Microsystems settlement and a $605 million fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $280 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
INVESTMENT INCOME
 
The components of investment income are as follows:
 
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Dividends and interest income declined $84 million to $387 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to the comparable quarter in fiscal 2003 due to a higher allocation of funds to lower-yielding, more liquid asset classes. Net recognized gains from investments increased to $589 million compared to $274 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year, primarily due to sales of investments as the Company moved to more liquid investment asset classes during the quarter. Net recognized gains from investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $16 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 compared to $59 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Derivative losses increased by $350 million to $406 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the impact of interest rate increases on interest rate derivative instruments and foreign currency movements relative to certain foreign currency positions used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Dividends and interest income declined $65 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 mainly due to $96 million of AT&T dividends earned in the prior fiscal year. Net recognized gains from investments were $1.56 billion compared to $44 million in the prior year driven mainly by lower other-than-temporary impairments as well as higher realized gains on sales resulting from the reallocation of the portfolio toward liquidity during the quarter. Other-than-temporary impairments were $82 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.15 billion in the prior year. The decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions. Derivative losses decreased $156 million to $268 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to derivative positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities.
 
INCOME TAXES
 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 is approximately 27%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 33%. A benefit of $208 million was recorded during the fourth quarter from the reversal of previously accrued taxes from resolving the remaining open issue remanded by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in its December 2002 ruling. During the third quarter the tax rate increased due to the European Commission fine, which is not tax deductible. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the initial items from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling referred to above, that reversed, in part, a previous Tax Court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33% for fiscal 2003.
 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 
 
Effective July 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, , using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, . Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid-in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes.

Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On our balance sheet, cash and short-term investments totaled $60.59 billion, equity and other investments were $12.21 billion and we have no debt as of June 30, 2004.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and a half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2004 decreased $838 million from June 30, 2003 reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that has outpaced additions, primarily driven by recognition from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and a $489 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. Starting April 1, 2003 revenue deferred for undelivered elements reflected lower deferral rates, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned.
 
The following table outlines the expected recognition of $8.18 billion of unearned revenue balance at June 30, 2004:
 
 
The revenue earned from the Upgrade Advantage programs for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 was as follows:
 
 
Cash Flow
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased $1.03 billion compared to prior year's fourth quarter. The decrease primarily reflects cash outflows during the quarter of $1.95 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and $605 million for the European Commission fine.
 
Cash received from financing activities was $1.30 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $483 million used for financing activities in the comparable quarter of the prior year. We did not repurchase shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 48.1 million shares repurchased in the prior year's fourth quarter.
 
Cash received from investing activities was $3.69 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $90 million used for investing activities in the prior year's fourth quarter. The increase reflects allocation of short-term investments toward more liquid securities during the current quarter.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Cash flow from operations decreased $1.17 billion from fiscal 2003. The decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the European Commissions fine mentioned above partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings.
 
Cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. We repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2004.
 
Cash used for investing was $2.75 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $4.47 billion from fiscal 2003, due to a $3.63 billion decrease in net investment purchases and a $1.06 billion decrease in acquisition spending.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International Web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07 ( available for download from the XBRL International Web site). XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On October 21, 2004, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $9.19 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, a 12% increase over revenue of $8.22 billion for the same period in the prior year. Operating income for the first quarter was $4.05 billion and net income was $2.90 billion. Diluted earnings per share exceeded Microsoft's guidance by $0.02 and were $0.27 including stock-based compensation expense.
Redmond, Wash.  Oct. 21, 2004 
 
"We've had a strong beginning to what we expect will be a very good year with continued growth in both our commercial and consumer businesses," said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "This quarter we had a very healthy commercial server and desktop business driving double digit revenue growth, and we expect to continue the trend of growing revenue faster than expenses as we work to make each of our businesses more efficient and profitable."
 
Demand for Microsoft's core platform products from business customers and growth in shipments of PCs and servers drove strong results in the Client, Information Worker and Server and Tools groups. In particular, Server and Tools revenue grew 19% driven by broad platform strength led by Windows Server, SQL Server and Exchange Server. "In addition to the success of our flagship server products, we continue to be very pleased with the customer momentum for our management products. The recent release of Microsoft Operations Manager 2005 and the upcoming release of Microsoft System Center 2005 are creating excitement in the market, as evidenced by the greater than 20% revenue growth this quarter in our management server business. This is another example of integrated innovation across the entire Windows Server System adding business value for our customers," said Eric Rudder, senior vice president, Server and Tools group.
 
Microsoft's consumer-focused businesses also performed well. MSN again achieved segment profitability while growing revenues by 10% over the first quarter of the prior year on continued strength in its Internet advertising business. Home and Entertainment revenue grew
9% driven by increased sales of Xbox consoles and games while its operating loss narrowed by more than 47% compared to the prior first quarter as a result of higher than expected sales of Xbox games. Set to launch on November 9
th
, Halo 2 is one of the most anticipated video games on any platform and has achieved record-breaking video game pre-orders of 1.5 million. "Xbox continues to be the only platform to show year-over-year growth and has now outsold Sony PlayStation 2 for two months in a row in the United States," said Robbie Bach, senior vice president, Home and Entertainment group. "With a robust portfolio of games and cornerstone titles like Halo 2 and Fable  which was the top selling video game across all platforms in September  our holiday lineup is the strongest in Xbox history. Moreover, with 150 Xbox Live titles available this holiday, we expect the market momentum around the Xbox business to continue to accelerate."
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending December 31, 2004:

Summary
 
 
Our revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was primarily driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, Information Worker products and Windows Client operating systems through OEMs, as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments and overall improvements in IT spending. We believe that small and mid-market customers led the improvements in IT spending.
 
We estimate growth in PC shipments was 10% during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2004. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 18% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in the three months ended September 30, 2004, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from prior year been in effect in first quarter fiscal 2005, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $221 million lower. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposure.
 
For the three months ended September 30, 2004, the operating income increase of $903 million was primarily driven by an increase in revenue in Client and Information Worker, which have higher gross margins as compared with other segments. The operating income increase was also attributable to lower headcount-related costs, primarily associated with a $270 million decline in stock-based compensation expense.
 
 
Our seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Fiscal year 2004 segment information has been restated for certain internal reorganization and changes to certain internal accounting methods to conform to the current period presentation. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses were $771 million, and $807 million in the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 respectively. The increase in corporate expenses was due to an increase in global marketing and headcount and other costs, partially offset by a $39 million decline in stock-based compensation and lower legal costs.
Client
 
 
Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. The Client revenue growth is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems.
 
Client revenue increase was driven by a 10% growth in OEM licenses and 6% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments. The difference between OEM unit growth and revenue growth was driven partially by the continuing impact of the fiscal 2003 revision in the deferral rates and product lives on undelivered elements of unearned revenue. The mix of Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total Client operating systems licensed during the quarter decreased by 2 percentage points to 60% of total Client operating system as compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year because of a decline in commercial and retail licensing of premium Client operating systems.
 
Client operating income for the quarter increased from the prior year due to growth in Client OEM revenue and a decrease in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $29 million decline in stock-based compensation. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with the continued development of the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn) and completion and delivery of revisions addressing security vulnerabilities and program fixes including Windows Service Pack 2. The operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 has been restated due to the consolidation of the Windows Security group within Client from Server and Tools.
 
We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix and anticipate that continued PC market growth will result in revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal year 2005. We expect these impacts to be partially offset by the decrease in revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements. We expect that our Enterprise Agreement (EA) contracts that expire in fiscal 2005 will be partially offset by renewals and new EA contracts. The Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth.
 
Server and Tools
 
 
Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. The segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customer segments. The segment uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 have been restated due to the reclassification of Professional product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.
 
We estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 16% in the first three months of fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year. Server and Tools revenue increase was driven by an estimated 18% increase in
Windows-based server shipments resulting in 19% growth in new Windows Server license units as well as growth in SQL Server, Exchange Server and Core CAL revenue. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $288 million or 20% in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $64 million or 23% compared to the prior year primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes provided approximately $71 million or 4 percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth.
 
Server and Tools operating income growth was primarily due to a 19% increase in revenue and a 2% growth in operating expenses. Lower headcount costs, driven primarily by a $94 million decline in stock-based compensation partially offset by an increase in research and development costs associated with product development for upcoming products such as SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005, contributed to the relatively low growth in operating expenses. The operating income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 has been restated due to the reclassification of Windows Security group within Client from Server and Tools.
 
Information Worker
 
 
Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Small and Mid-Market Solutions & Partners (SMS&P) organization, which was historically part of the Information Worker segment, was aligned in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. As a result of this re-alignment, Information Worker segment information has been restated to reflect the transfer of the SMS&P organization to Microsoft Business Solutions. The results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 have also been restated due to the reclassification of product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.
 
The increase in Information Worker revenue was primarily attributable to 13% or $261 million in volume licensing and retail packaged product growth driven by the continued strength of Office 2003 and a favorable comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2004 due to $137 million of revenue deferred for Office 2003 product upgrade rights provided to customers who purchased Office in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Additionally, foreign exchange rate changes provided approximately $97 million or 4 percentage points of revenue growth compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Continued strength of Office 2003 also resulted in OEM licensing revenue growth of 15% or $45 million in the first quarter fiscal 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2004.
 
Information Worker operating income in the three months ended September 30, 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue and a reduction in operating expense associated with headcount-related costs primarily from a $32 million decline in stock-based compensation in the quarter.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
Microsoft Business Solutions develops and markets business applications and related services designed to help small and mid-market businesses efficiently use, manage, and analyze business resources. Our products consist of Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, MBN/Retail Manager, other business applications, and the Microsoft Partner Program. Microsoft Business Solutions revenues are affected by the general economic environment and enterprise information technology spending in particular. As announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Microsoft Business Solutions now includes the SMS&P organization, which previously had been included in Information Worker. Microsoft Business Solution results have been restated to reflect the inclusion of SMS&P for all periods presented. Also as a result of the reorganization, Microsoft Partner Program became a component of Microsoft Business Solutions.
 
The increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2004 was driven by continued growth from Microsoft CRM and Microsoft Axapta products, together with a 26% increase in Microsoft Partner Program revenue.
 
The operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2004 declined from the comparable period in fiscal 2004 due to higher Microsoft Business Solutions product revenue, reduced acquisition amortization costs, and lower headcountrelated costs primarily associated with a $16 million decline in stock-based compensation in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005.
 
MSN
 
 
MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and information services, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the World. MSN also provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment including MSN Internet Access, and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access.
 
In the first quarter of 2005, MSN advertising revenue increased $56 million or 23% from the prior year. The increase was partially offset by a decline of $28 million or 12% in Internet Access revenue, primarily from the migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $21 million in the first quarter of 2005 to $38 million. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2005, MSN had 3.8 million Internet Access subscribers compared to 5.6 million at the end of the same quarter last year, and 9.1 million total subscribers compared to 8.0 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. In addition, MSN has over 350 million unique users monthly, 187 million active Hotmail accounts, and 146 million active Messenger accounts.
 
MSN operating income improvement was attributable to an increase in revenue from advertising in both display and paid search, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet Access business, and a reduction in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $19 million decline in stock-based compensation. The increase in operating income was partially offset by a tax refund of $48 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile phones and Pocket PCs. The segment is also responsible for managing sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunication, cable and wireless companies, and host and network equipment providers. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles that affect our continuing revenue streams.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices segment revenue growth was primarily driven by unit volume increases in all product lines, especially embedded products and MapPoint. The growth was driven by embedded products due to increased shipments in existing channels and an expansion of the distribution channel, increasing market share for Pocket PCs, and the introduction of new MapPoint products. The growth was hampered by delayed introduction of new SmartPhone devices. MapPoint revenue benefited from Street & Trips 2005 and Street & Trips GPS bundle that were launched in August 2004.
 
The operating loss for Mobile and Embedded Devices for the three months ended September 30, 2004 decreased compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in revenue and a reduction in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $9 million decline in stock-based compensation.
 
Home and Entertainment
 
 
Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The relative success of competing video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the relative market share of the console. We are a relatively new entrant in the video game console business with our first release in fiscal 2002, and have already established ourselves as one of the leaders. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since 2002, but revenue growth moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this stage in the console lifecycle. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, providing higher margins to offset the decreasing price trend on consoles sold. Currently, Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.
 
In the three months ended September 30, 2004, Xbox revenue increased $71 million or 23% with $129 million related to higher Xbox software and console volumes as compared with the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. This was partially offset by a $58 million decline related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Xbox console volumes increased 4% in the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared to fiscal 2004. The Xbox life-to-date U.S. games attach rate increased to 7.3 games per console according to industry analyst NPD as of September 30, 2004. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $20 million or 7% compared to fiscal 2004 due to lower PC games software sales.
 
The decrease in operating loss in the three months ended September 30, 2004 was primarily due to an increase in Xbox software volumes and a reduction in headcount related costs, primarily associated with a $19 million decline in stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the next generation console development efforts. Operating expenses continue to be driven by investment in the next generation Xbox platform design, sales and marketing efforts directed towards holiday season promotions, and headcount-related costs.
Cost of revenue
 
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2004 was primarily driven by a reduction in costs associated with MSN Internet Access and a reduction in headcount-related costs primarily associated with a $40 million decline in stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services.
 
Research and development
 
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased due to a $136 million decline in stock-based compensation costs. This was partially offset by an increase in product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the next generation of Xbox console, SQL Server 2005code named "Yukon" and other server products.
 
Sales and marketing
 
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 due to a net 4% increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions, principally in the Enterprise and Small/ Medium business sales forces, partially offset by a $63 million decline in headcount-related stock-based compensation. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was also attributable to an 8% increase in marketing expense primarily related to global marketing programs and Home and Entertainment.
General and administrative
 
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2004 due to lower legal costs and stock-based compensation costs. This was partially offset by costs associated with an increase in headcount.
 
INVESTMENT INCOME, INCOME TAXES, AND OTHER
 
Investment Income and Other
 
The components of investment income and other are as follows:
 
 
Dividends and interest income declined $73 million to $411 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 as compared to the corresponding quarter in fiscal 2004 due to a higher allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes. Net realized gains on investments declined to $53 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to $245 million in the first quarter of the prior year resulting from fewer sales of investments. Net realized gains on investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $23 million in the three months ended September 30, 2004 compared to $18 million in comparable period in fiscal 2004. Net derivative losses were $195 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to net gains of $34 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year resulting primarily from interest rate and foreign currency related instruments. Derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, losses related to interest rate derivatives used to economically hedge against a rise in interest rates were $75 million resulting from a decline in longer-term interest rates. These losses were offset by unrealized gains related to an increase in the market value of fixed income securities. Also during the first quarter of 2005, losses related to foreign currency contracts were $105 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the dollar generally declined against most currencies (except the yen), as well as economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, losses related to foreign currency and interest rated sensitive contracts were not significant. Net gains (losses) on equity investees and other for the prior period were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 was 33%.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $64.42 billion as of September 30, 2004 compared to $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. Equity and other investments were $12.19 billion as of September 30, 2004. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of September 30, 2004 decreased $395 million from June 30, 2004, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that has outpaced additions by $270 million, and a $96 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. We earned approximately $379 million and $37 million from the Upgrade Advantage programs for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively, and do not expect to earn a meaningful amount of revenue in the future.
 
The following table outlines the expected recognition of $7.78 billion of unearned revenue at September 30, 2004:
 
Cash Flows
 
Cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2004 increased $583 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to $4.01 billion, due to a $287 million increase in net income and $306 million decrease in impact of deferred revenue. Cash used for financing was $738 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, an increase of $388 million from the corresponding period in fiscal 2004. The increase reflects the $870 million cash dividend paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. In addition, cash used for common stock repurchases was $355 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to $1.05 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Cash used for investing was $8.11 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, an increase of $4.37 billion from the first quarter of fiscal 2004, due to a $4.36 billion increase in combined investment sales, purchases and maturities combined with the effect of purchasing more highly liquid securities considered cash equivalents during the prior quarter.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On November 8, 2004, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing that it had reached an agreement with Novell, Inc. to resolve certain antitrust claims. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Novell and Microsoft Reach Settlement on Antitrust Claims
 
Novell Releases Antitrust Claims for Netware and Agrees to Withdraw From European Commission Case
 
Microsoft Corporation today announced that it has reached an agreement with Novell, Inc. to resolve all antitrust claims as of today relating to Novell's NetWare product and all of the other products and businesses which it currently owns. The agreement results from a private mediation between the two companies.
REDMOND, Wash.  Nov. 8, 2004 
 
As part of this agreement, Novell will release its antitrust claims under U.S. and all other national and state laws concerning these products. Novell will also withdraw from participation in the European Commission's case with Microsoft and will no longer participate as an intervener on behalf of the European Commission in Microsoft's appeal of the Commission's March 24 ruling. Microsoft will pay Novell $536 million under the agreement, and Microsoft will also release its compulsory counterclaims to those antitrust claims regarding NetWare. The agreement does not obligate Microsoft to license or otherwise share any of its technology or intellectual property rights with Novell, nor does it include any admission of wrongdoing by Microsoft.
 
While the parties were able to resolve all antitrust claims related to Novell's current businesses, including NetWare, they have not been able to reach agreement concerning Novell's antitrust claims related to its ownership of WordPerfect between June 1994 and March 1996. Novell retains the right to pursue those claims. In addition, both parties retain the right to pursue past or future patent claims.
 
"Over the past two years, we have made a sustained effort to build more constructive relationships with our industry partners and competitors," said Brad Smith, senior vice president and general counsel for Microsoft. "Today's Netware settlement is a product of that effort and reflects an open dialogue the companies established to address and ultimately resolve this matter. We could not resolve claims related to WordPerfect in any manner we thought appropriate, and we are prepared to turn to the courts to resolve it."
 
Due to the nature and timing of the settlement, the first quarter financial results that were previously released on October 21, 2004 will be updated to include the impact of the settlement. Net income and earnings per share for the quarter were $2.53 billion and $0.23 respectively, including $359 million ($536 million pre-tax) or $0.03 per share relating to the settlement.
 
In light of recent progress in addressing antitrust litigation and claims that have been made against Microsoft, including the recent developments with Novell, the company believes that it can now estimate the additional antitrust exposure that it is reasonably possible it will incur. The company estimates that it is reasonably possible it will incur additional exposure of up to $950 million for remaining antitrust claims, including $200 million above the amount previously described in its most recent 10-K filing with the SEC related to resolving remaining class action overcharge cases.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International Web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07 ( available for download from the XBRL International Web site). XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K:

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 9, 2004, at the Microsoft Corporation annual meeting of shareholders, shareholders approved two proposals relating to amendments to the Company's 2001 Stock Plan, 1991 Stock Option Plan, 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and Stock Option Plan for Consultants and Advisors (collectively, the "Plans"). The amendments proposed at the meeting therefore became effective on November 9, 2004. The amended and restated Plans are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.5.
 
Each of the Plans have been amended in similar ways to permit the Board to adjust awards, the numeric grant limitations in the plan, and the number of shares covered by the plan in the event of any distribution to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. The first paragraph of Section 14 of the 2001 Stock Plan has been restated to read as follows:
 
14. Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Plan.
 
If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award, (iv) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under the Plan, and (v) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Awards with a vesting period of less than three years. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(v) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 14, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 14, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
 
The adjustment provisions of the 1991 Stock Option Plan, the 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Consultants and Advisors Plan have been similarly revised. Each amended Plan also includes related changes to implement the effect of the revisions to the adjustment provisions. The adjustment provisions of the Plans previously allowed for adjustments to awards for a capital event. Those provisions have been revised to provide express authority to make adjustments for distributions to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend.
 
As a result of the approval of the amendments to the 2001 Stock Plan and the 1991 Stock Option Plan, the special dividend of $3.00 per share conditionally declared July 20, 2004 has become unconditional. The adjustments to the employee awards approved by the Board under the stock plans and the increase in the maximum number of shares issuable under each plan by the additional number of shares covered by awards under the plans as a result of the adjustments occurred on November 15, 2004, the ex-dividend date for the special dividend.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Awards of Options that are transferred to a third party pursuant to a program under which the holder of certain Options may transfer such Options to such third party in exchange for cash or other consideration, shall be removed from the Plan and the Shares subject to such Awards shall not be available for regrant under the Plan regardless of whether the transferred Options are exercised or expire without exercise.
 
4. .
Administration of the Plan
 
(a) . The Plan shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Company.
Procedure
 
(i) The Board of Directors may appoint one or more Committees each consisting of not less than two members of the Board of Directors to administer the Plan on behalf of the Board of Directors, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors may prescribe. Once appointed, such Committees shall continue to serve until otherwise directed by the Board of Directors.
 
(ii) From time to time the Board of Directors may increase the size of the Committee(s) and appoint additional members thereof, remove members (with or without cause) and appoint new members in substitution therefor, or fill vacancies however caused.
 
(b) . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to grant Incentive Stock Options, Nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Awards, and SARs; (ii) to determine, in accordance with Section 11(b) of the Plan, the fair market value of the Shares; (iii) to determine, in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per share of Awards to be granted; (iv) to determine the Participants to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted and the number of Shares to be represented by each Award; (v) to interpret the Plan and the terms of Awards; (vi) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; including the form of Award Agreement, and manner of acceptance of an Award, (vii) to determine the terms and provisions of each Award to be granted (which need not be identical) and, with the consent of the Awardee, modify or amend any Award; (viii) to authorize conversion or substitution under the Plan of any or all Conversion Options; (ix) to accelerate or defer (with the consent of the Awardee) the vesting or exercise date of any Award; (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Award previously granted by the Board; and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; no consent of an Awardee is necessary under clauses (vii) or (ix) if the modification, amendment, acceleration, or deferral, in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit on the Awardee, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 14.
Powers of the Board
provided that,
 
The Board may, but need not, determine that an award shall vest or be granted subject to the satisfaction of one or more performance goals. Performance goals for awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board and will be designed to support the business strategy, and align executives' interests with customer and shareholder interests. For awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), performance goals will be based on one or more of the following business criteria: sales or licensing volume, revenues, customer satisfaction, expenses, organizational health/productivity, earnings (which includes similar measurements such as net profits, operating profits and net income, and which may be calculated before or after taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization or taxes), margins, cash flow, shareholder return, return on equity, return on assets or return on investments, working capital, product shipments or releases, brand or product recognition or acceptance and/or stock price. These criteria may be measured: individually, alternatively or in any combination; with respect to the Company, a subsidiary, division, business unit, product line, product or any combination of the foregoing; on an absolute basis, or relative to a target, to a designated comparison group, to results in other periods or to other external measures; and including or excluding items that could affect the measurement, such as extraordinary or unusual and nonrecurring gains or losses, litigation or claim judgments or settlements, material changes in tax laws, acquisitions or divestitures, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, asset write-downs, restructuring charges, or the results of discontinued operations.
 
(c) . All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all Participants and Awardees.
Effect of Board's Decision
 
5. .
Eligibility
 
(a) Awards may be granted to Participants and to persons to whom offers of employment as an Employee have been extended; provided that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees. For avoidance of doubt, directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan unless they are Employees or Consultants.
 
(b) The maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Award or Awards may be granted to any Participant in any one taxable year of the Company (the "Maximum Annual Participant Award") shall not exceed 20,000,000 Common Shares for Options or SARs, or 5,000,000 shares for Stock Awards (increased, in both cases proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares). If an Option is in tandem with an SAR, such that the exercise of the Option or SAR with respect to a Share cancels the tandem SAR or Option right, respectively, with respect to each Share, the tandem Option and SAR rights with respect to each Share shall be counted as covering but one Share for purposes of the Maximum Annual Participant Award.
 
6. .
Options
 
(a) Each Option shall be designated in the written or electronic option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
 
(b) For purposes of Section 6(a), Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the fair market value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(c) Options converted or substituted under the Plan for any or all outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights held by employees, consultants, advisors or other option holders granted by entities subsequently acquired by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company ("Conversion Options") shall be effective as of the close of the respective mergers and acquisitions of such entities by the Company. The Conversion Options may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options, as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that stock appreciation rights in the acquired entity shall only be converted to or substituted with Nonqualified Stock Options. The Conversion Options shall be options to purchase the number of Common Shares determined by multiplying the number of shares of the acquired entity's common stock underlying each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the closing of such merger or acquisition by the number specified in the applicable merger or acquisition agreement for conversion of each share of such entity's common stock to a Common Share (the "Merger Ratio"). Such Conversion Options shall be exercisable at an exercise price per Common Share (increased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of the acquired entity's common stock under each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to closing divided by the Merger Ratio. No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of Conversion Options. In lieu of such issuance, the Common Shares issued pursuant to each such exercise shall be rounded to the closest whole Share. All other terms and conditions applicable to such stock options and stock appreciation rights prior to closing of the acquisition, including vesting, shall remain unchanged under the Conversion Options.
 
7. .
Stock Awards
 
(a) Stock Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan. After the Committee determines that it will offer a Stock Award, it will advise the Awardee in writing or electronically, by means of an Award Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions, including vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the Awardee shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the time within which the Awardee must accept the offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Award Agreement in the manner determined by the Committee.
 
(b) Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Common Shares underlying such Stock Award upon the Awardee ceasing to be a Participant. To the extent that the Awardee purchased the Shares granted under such Stock Award and any such Shares remain non-vested at the time the Awardee ceases to be a Participant, the cessation of Participant status shall cause an immediate sale of such non-vested Shares to the Company at the original price per Common Share paid by the Awardee.
 
8. .
SARs
 
(a) The Committee shall have the full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant SARs to selected Awardees. The Committee is authorized to grant both tandem stock appreciation rights ("Tandem SARs") and stand-alone stock appreciation rights ("Stand-Alone SARs") as described below.
 
(b) .
Tandem SARs
 
(i) Awardees may be granted a Tandem SAR, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying Section 6 Option for Common Shares or the surrender of the Option in exchange for a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the fair market value (on the Option surrender date) of the number of Shares in which the Awardee is at the time vested under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (B) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested Shares.
 
(ii) No such Option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Committee, either at the time of the actual Option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distributions to which the Awardee shall become entitled under this Section 8(b) may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the Option surrender date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
 
(iii) If the surrender of an Option is not approved by the Committee, then the Awardee shall retain whatever rights he or she had under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) on the Option surrender date and may exercise such rights at any time prior to the later of (A) five (5) business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (B) the last day on which the Option is otherwise exercisable in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing such Option, but in no event may such rights be exercised more than ten (10) years after the date of the Option grant.
 
(c) .
Stand-Alone SARs
 
(i) An Awardee may be granted a Stand-Alone SAR not tied to any underlying Option under Section 6 of the Plan. The Stand-Alone SAR shall cover a specified number of Common Shares and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish. Upon exercise of the Stand-Alone SAR, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate fair market value (on the exercise date) of the Common Shares underlying the exercised right over (B) the aggregate base price in effect for those Shares.
 
(ii) The number of Common Shares underlying each Stand-Alone SAR and the base price in effect for those Shares shall be determined by the Committee at the time the Stand-Alone SAR is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per Share be less than the fair market value per underlying Common Share on the grant date.
 
(iii) The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone SAR may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
 
(d) The Common Shares underlying any SARs exercised under this Section 8 shall not be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
 
9. . The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date. It shall continue in effect until terminated under Section 17 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
 
10. .
Term of Award; Limitations on Vesting and Repricing
 
(a) The term of each Award shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.
 
(b) Each award shall vest over a period of not less than three (3) years from the date of grant, provided that awards covering up to 50,000,000 shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event) may be granted without regard to the 3-year vesting restriction; provided further, that Conversion Options and awards that are granted or vest based on performance goals shall not count toward the limit of this Section 10(b).
 
(c) No Award may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, or modified without approval of the shareholders of the Company (except in connection with an adjustment pursuant to Section 14) if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the Shares underlying such Award.
 
11. .
Exercise Price and Consideration
 
(a) The per Share exercise price under each Award shall be such price as is determined by the Board, subject to the following:
 
(i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
 
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(B) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(ii) Except for Conversion Options under Section 6(c), the per Share exercise price under a Nonqualified Stock Option or SAR shall be no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or any other provision of the Plan), Options and SARs that are granted to Employees who are non-exempt for purposes of the FLSA, shall satisfy the requirements for exclusion from regular rate of pay for purposes of the FLSA and shall have an exercise price that is at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the underlying Shares at the time of grant; furthermore, such Options or SARs shall not be exercisable within the six (6) month period immediately following the date of grant, except, if so provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of the Awardee's death, disability, or retirement, upon a change in corporate control of the Company, or under such other circumstances as are permitted under the FLSA or rules and regulations thereunder.
 
(iii) The maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under this Plan is 50,000,000 Shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, or stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares); provided that Conversion Options shall not count against the limit of this Section 11(a)(iii).
 
(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Share on the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") on the date of grant. If the Shares cease to be listed on Nasdaq, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Shares.
 
(c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Award, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price. If the Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the officer may, in addition, be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price with Shares which, as of the exercise date, the officer has owned for six (6) months or more. If the Awardee is a participant in the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain And Bonus Deferral Program, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price of any deferred Option with Shares. Shares used by officers to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.
 
(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Award, the Awardee shall pay any federal, state, and local income and employment tax withholding obligations applicable to such Award. If an Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may elect to pay such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Award is exercised. The right of an officer to dispose of Shares to the Company in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an Award, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld.
 
12. .
Exercise of Award
 
(a) . Any Award granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
 
An Award may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
An Award shall be deemed to be exercised when written or electronic notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 11(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award. In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.
 
Exercise of an Award in any manner and delivery of the Shares subject to such Award shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Award, by the number of Shares as to which the Award is exercised.
 
(b) . In the event of termination of an Awardee's Continuous Status as a Participant, such Awardee may exercise his or her rights under any outstanding Awards to the extent exercisable on the date of termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Award as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise his or her rights under such Awards at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such rights within the time specified in the individual Award Agreements, the Awards shall terminate.
Termination of Status as a Participant
 
(c) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of termination of an Awardee's Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months), the Awardee will vest in the Award, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee remained in Continuous Status as a Participant for a period of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(c) must be exercised within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise such Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Award shall terminate.
Disability of Awardee
 
(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of the death of an Awardee:
Death of Awardee
 
(i) who is at the time of death a Participant, the Award will vest, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as a Participant twelve (12) months following the date of death. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(d)(i) may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Award by bequest or inheritance; or
 
(ii) whose Option or SAR has not yet expired but whose Continuous Status as a Participant terminated prior to the date of death, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had vested at the date of termination.
 
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this Section 12, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding Option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an Award beyond the date on which the Award would have expired if no termination of the Employee's Continuous Status as a Participant had occurred).
 
13. . An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Awardee, only by the Awardee; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
Non-Transferability of Awards
 
14. . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award, (iv) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under the Plan, and (v) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Awards with a vesting period of less than three years. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(v) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 14, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 14, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Plan
 
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Award shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Awardee the right to exercise an Award as to all or any part of the Shares subject to an Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each Award shall be assumed or an equivalent award shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or to substitute an equivalent award, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Awardee to have the right to exercise the Award as to all of the Shares subject to Awards, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Award fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Awardee that the Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Award will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
15. . The date of grant of an Award shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to the grant of such Award and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the grant, exercise or vesting of an Award shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Participant to whom an Award is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.
Time of Granting Awards
 
16. . The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Awards before and after the substitution.
Substitutions and Assumptions
 
17. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a) . The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Company's ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that any increase in the number of Shares subject to the Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment under Section 14 of the Plan, and any amendment described in Section 10(c) of the Plan, shall require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b) . The Board shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants performing services in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.

Powers of the Board
 
(c) . All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of any Options granted under the Plan.
Effect of Board's Decision
 
5. .
Eligibility
 
(a) Options may be granted only to Employees. For avoidance of doubt, directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan unless they are full-time Employees.
 
(b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the Shares with respect to
 
which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
 
(c) For purposes of Section 5(b), Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the fair market value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(d) Nothing in the Plan or any Option granted hereunder shall confer upon any Optionee any right with respect to continuation of employment with the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.
 
(e) The maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Option or Options may be granted to any Employee in any one taxable year of the Company shall not exceed 16,000,000 shares (the "Maximum Annual Employee Grant").
 
6. . The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board. No new Options may be granted under the Plan, provided that Shares subject to the Plan (other than Shares issued in the exercise of Options granted under the Plan) shall be available for grants and awards under the 2001 Plan as provided in Section 3 and awards shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 11.
Term of Plan
 
7. . The term of each Option shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.
Term of Option
 
8. .
Exercise Price and Consideration
 
(a) The per Share exercise price under each Option shall be such price as is determined by the Board, subject to the following:
 
(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
 
(i) granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(ii) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(2) In the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option the per Share exercise price may be less than, equal to, or greater than the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Share on the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") on the date of grant. If the Shares cease to be listed on Nasdaq, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Shares.
 
(c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price. If the Optionee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price with Shares. If the Optionee is a participant in the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain And Bonus Deferral Program, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price of any deferred Option with Shares. Shares used by officers to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.
 
(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Option, the Optionee shall pay any federal, state, and local withholding obligations of the Company, if applicable. If an Optionee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may elect to pay such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Option is exercised. The right of an officer to dispose of Shares to the Company in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an option, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations.
 
9. .
Exercise of Option
 
(a) . Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
 
An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with
 
respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Option. In the event that the exercise of an Option is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 5(b), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 11 of the Plan.
 
Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(b) . In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, such Optionee may exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of termination. Such exercise must occur within three (3) months (or such shorter time as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Termination of Status as Employee
 
(c) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months), the Optionee may exercise the Option, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee remained in Continuous Status as an Employee for a period of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Employee ceased working as a result of the total and permanent disability. Such exercise must occur within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the Employee ceased working as a result of the total and permanent disability (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Disability of Optionee
 
(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of the death of an Optionee:
Death of Optionee
 
(i) who is at the time of death an Employee of the Company, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as an Employee twelve (12) months after the date of death; or
 
(ii) whose Option has not yet expired but whose Continuous Status as an Employee terminated prior to the date of death, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.
 
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) above, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an option beyond the date on which the option would have expired if no termination of the Employee's Continuous Status as an Employee had occurred).
 
10. . The Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
Non-Transferability of Options
 
11. . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per share covered by outstanding Options under the Plan, and (iii) the Maximum Annual Employee Grant. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 11, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and (iii) the possibility that some Optionees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Options, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Options will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Options. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 11, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected "without receipt of consideration." Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Option.
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger
 
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless
 
otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Optionee the right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the Optioned Shares, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or to substitute an equivalent option, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Optionee to have the right to exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Shares, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Optionee that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
12. . The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to the grant of an option and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the exercise of an option shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Employee to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.
Time of Granting Options
 
13. . The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Options in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Options assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Options before and after the substitution.
Substitutions and Assumptions
 
14. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a) . The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Company's ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that any increase in the number of Shares subject to the Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment under Section 11 of the Plan, shall require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b) . The Board shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Options granted to Employees employed in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
Employees in Foreign Countries
 
(c) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 4 and 11, any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Options
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
already granted and such Options shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
 
15. . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
16. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
 
17. . The Plan, as amended, is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If the Plan, as herein amended, is not so approved by the shareholders, the Plan, as previously approved, shall continue in effect.
Shareholder Approval
 
 
[The number of shares in Sections 3 and 5(e) have been increased to reflect the 2-for-1 stock splits in May 1994, November 1996, February 1998, March 1999 and February 2003. The number of shares in Section 3 has also been increased to reflect the adjustments related to the special dividend payable December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004.]
 

Exhibit 10.3
 
 
1.
Purpose
 
The purpose of the Microsoft Corporation 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan") is to attract and retain the services of experienced and knowledgeable independent directors of Microsoft Corporation (the "Corporation") for the benefit of the Corporation and its stockholders and to provide additional incentive for such directors to continue to work for the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders through continuing ownership of its common stock.
 
2.
Shares Subject to the Plan
 
The total number of shares of common stock of the Corporation ("Shares") for which Awards (as defined in Section 4) may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed 3,550,214 in the aggregate, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 12 hereof. Within the foregoing limitation, Shares underlying Awards that have been granted pursuant to the Plan but which Awards have lapsed or otherwise terminated without delivery of Shares shall become available for the grant of additional Awards.
 
3.
Administration of Plan
 
The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall administer the Plan. The Board may delegate responsibility for administration of the Plan to a Board committee (the "Committee") composed solely of two or more directors, each of whom is a "Non-Employee Director" (as that term is defined in Rule 16b-3(b) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to its authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")). The Board or the Committee, as the case may be, shall have the power to construe the Plan and the terms of the Shares, to determine all questions arising thereunder, and to adopt and amend such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable; provided that, no consent of an Awardee is necessary where the modification, amendment, acceleration, or deferral in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit upon the Awardee, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 12. References to the "Board" in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to either the Board or the Committee, whichever is appropriate in the context in which the word is used.
 
4.
Discretionary Award Grants
 
Pursuant to this Plan, the Board may grant in its discretion an Award (as defined in this Section 4) to any person who (a) is elected a director of the Corporation, and (b) is not, and has not during the immediately preceding 12 month period been, an employee of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation. An "Award" may be either (i) a grant of a stock option (an "Option") or (ii) a grant of Shares or of a right to receive Shares or their cash equivalent (or both) (a "Stock Award"). No Awards under this Section 4 may be granted to any individual director with respect to more than 10,000 shares for any calendar year or, in the case of a newly elected director, more than 25,000 shares for the year in which the director is first elected. No director shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under this Plan. Having received an Award under this Plan shall not give a director any right to receive any other Award under this Plan and the Board may determine that any or all director(s) are not eligible to receive an Award under this Plan for an indefinite period or for a specified year or years.
5.
Award Agreement
 
Each Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award agreement (the "Agreement") duly executed on behalf of the Corporation and by the director to whom such Award is granted, which Agreements may but need not be identical and which shall (a) comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and (b) provide that the director agrees to continue to serve as a director of the Corporation during the term for which he or she was elected. Each Award shall vest over a period of not less than three (3) years from the date of grant, except with respect to Awards that are granted in lieu of cash compensation. Any Agreement may contain such other terms, provisions, and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board. No Award shall be deemed granted within the meaning of the Plan and no purported grant of any Award shall be effective, until such Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Corporation and the director to whom the Award is to be granted.
 
6.
Stock Awards
 
(a) Stock Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan. After the Board determines that it will offer a Stock Award, it will advise the director in writing or electronically, by means of an Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions, including vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the director shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the time within which the director must accept the offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Agreement or as otherwise directed by the Board.
 
(b) Unless the Board determines otherwise, the Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Shares underlying such Stock Award upon the director ceasing to be a director for any reason, including death. To the extent that the director purchased the Shares granted under such Stock Award and any such Shares remain non-vested at the time the director ceases to be a director, the cessation of director status shall cause an immediate sale of such non-vested Shares to the Company at the original price per Share paid by the director.
 
 
(a) The Board shall set the exercise price for an Option granted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan in its discretion.
 
(b) Each Option shall expire no more than ten years from the date of the granting thereof, but shall be subject to earlier termination as follows:
 
(i) In the event of the death of an Option holder, the Option granted to such person may be exercised to the extent exercisable on the date of death, within the earlier of (x) 180 days after the date of death of such person and (y) the date on which the Option expires by its terms, by the estate of such person, or by any person or persons who acquired the right to exercise such Option by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
 
(ii) In the event that an Option holder ceases to be a director of the Corporation, other than by reason of his or her death, an Option granted to such person may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date such person ceases to be a director, within the earlier of (x) 180 days after the date such person ceases to be a director and (y) the date on which the Option expires by its terms.
 
8.
Vesting and Exercise of Awards
 
(a) The Board shall set the vesting schedule for Awards granted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan in its discretion.
 
(b) To the extent that the right to exercise an Option has vested and is in effect, the Option may be exercised from time to time, by giving written notice, signed by the person or persons exercising the Option, to the Corporation, stating the number of whole Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, accompanied by payment in full for such Shares, which payment may be in whole or in part in shares of the common stock of the Corporation already owned by the person or persons exercising the Option, valued at fair market value on the date of payment. For purposes hereof, the fair market value of the Shares covered by an Option shall be the closing price of the Shares on the applicable date as reported in the National Market List of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. Automated Quotation System or on the principal national securities exchange on which the Shares are then listed for trading.
 
(c) Upon exercise of the Option, delivery of a certificate for fully paid and non-assessable Shares shall be made at the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Washington to the person or persons exercising the Option as soon as practicable (but in no event more than 30 days) after the date of receipt of the notice of exercise by the Corporation, or at such time, place, and manner as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the person or persons exercising the Option.
 
(d) Upon a Stock Award becoming fully vested and nonforfeitable, delivery of a certificate for fully paid and non-assessable Shares shall be made at the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Washington to the person to whom the Stock Award was granted as soon as practicable (but in no event more than 30 days) after the date on which the Stock Award becomes fully vested and nonforfeitable, or at such time, place, and manner as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the holder of the Stock Award.
 
(e) Prior to issuance of the Shares in connection with an Award, the director receiving the Award may request the Corporation to withhold and pay on the director's behalf any federal, state, and local income tax obligations applicable to such Award by having the Corporation withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount requested to be withheld, and any Award under the Plan may permit that such withholding tax be paid by having the Corporation withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount requested to be withheld. The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Award is exercised or granted, as applicable. The right of a director to dispose of Shares to the Corporation in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an Award, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations.
 
9.
Merger, Consolidation, Sale of Assets, etc., Resulting in a Change in Control
 
(a) In the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), notwithstanding the vesting provisions contained in the Agreement granting an Option or Stock Award, as applicable, to a director pursuant to this Plan, such Option shall become fully exercisable or Stock Award shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable if, within one year of such Change in Control, such director shall cease for any reason to be a member of the Board. For purposes hereof, a Change in Control of the Corporation shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) there shall be consummated (x) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of the common stock of the Corporation would be converted into cash, securities, or other property, other than a merger of the Corporation in which the holders of the common stock of the Corporation immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger, or (y) any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Corporation; or (ii) the stockholders of the Corporation approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation; or (iii) any person (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), other than William H. Gates III, shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock; or (iv) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the entire Board of Directors shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period.
 
(b) Any exercise of an Option permitted pursuant to this Section 9 shall be made within 180 days of the related director's termination as a director of the Corporation.
 
10.
Awards Not Transferable
 
An Award granted pursuant to the Plan may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the holder of an Award, only by the holder; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
 
11.
No Rights as Stockholder Until Holder
 
Neither the recipient of an Award under the Plan nor his successors in interest shall have any rights as a stockholder of the Corporation with respect to any Shares subject to an Award granted to such person until such person becomes a holder of record of such Shares.
 
12.
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger
 
If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under
 
the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan, and (iii) the limits on size of awards permitted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 12, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 12, conversion of any convertible securities of the Corporation shall not be deemed to have been effected "without receipt of consideration." Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Corporation of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of common stock subject to an Award.
 
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, an outstanding Award (i.e., an Option that has not been exercised or a Stock Award that has not become fully vested and nonforfeitable) will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Option holder the right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the stock covered by such Option, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or the merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, each Award shall be assumed or an equivalent Award shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume each and every Award or to substitute an equivalent Award, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the immediate full vesting of any Stock Awards not yet fully vested, or provide for the Option holder to have the right to exercise such Option as to all of the stock covered by such Option, including Shares as to which such Option would not otherwise be exercisable, or both. If the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Option holder that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
13.
Restrictions on Issue of Shares
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Corporation may delay the issuance of Shares covered by any Award and the delivery of a certificate for such Shares until one of the following conditions shall be satisfied:
 
(a) the Shares to be issued in connection with the grant or exercise of an Award, as applicable, are at the time of the issue of such Shares by the Corporation effectively registered under applicable federal securities laws now in force or hereafter amended; or
 
(b) counsel for the Corporation shall have given an opinion, which opinion shall not be unreasonably conditioned or withheld, that such Shares are exempt from registration under applicable federal securities laws now in force or hereafter amended.
 
It is intended that all grants of Stock Awards and exercises of Options shall be effective. Accordingly, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to bring about compliance with the above conditions within a reasonable time, except that the Corporation shall be under no obligation to cause a registration statement or a post-effective amendment to any registration statement to be prepared at its expense solely for the purpose of covering the issuance of Shares in connection with the grant or exercise of any Award.
 
14.
Purchase for Investment
 
Unless the Shares to be issued in connection with the grant or exercise of an Award granted under the Plan have been effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933 as now in force or hereafter amended, the Corporation shall be under no obligation to issue any Shares covered by any Award unless the person or persons to whom the Shares are to be issued, in whole or in part, shall give a written representation and undertaking to the Corporation, which is satisfactory in form and scope to counsel to the Corporation and upon which, in the opinion of such counsel, the Corporation may reasonably rely, that he or she is acquiring the shares issued or transferred to him or her for his or her own account as an investment and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the distribution of any such Shares, and that he or she will make no transfer of the same except in compliance with any rules and regulations in force at the time of such transfer under the Securities Act of 1933, or any other applicable law, and that if Shares are issued or transferred without such registration a legend to this effect may be placed upon the certificates representing the Shares.
 
15.
Expenses of the Plan
 
All costs and expenses of the adoption and administration of the Plan shall be borne by the Corporation and none of such expenses shall be charged to any director.
 
16.
Termination and Amendment of Plan
 
Unless sooner terminated as herein provided, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Effective Date. The Board may at any time terminate the Plan or make such modification or amendment thereof as it deems advisable; provided, however, that stockholder approval will be required for any amendment that will (a) increase the total number of shares as to which Awards may be granted under the Plan, (b) modify the class of persons eligible to receive Awards, or (c) otherwise require stockholder approval under any applicable law or regulation. In addition, the Board shall not amend the provisions in the Plan regarding the amount, pricing, and timing for grants pursuant to this Plan more than once every six months, other than to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code, or the rules thereunder. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3 and 12, termination or any modification or amendment of the Plan shall not, without the consent of an Award holder, affect his or her rights under an Award previously granted to him or her.
 
All share numbers in the Plan reflect the 2-for-1 stock split effected February 2003. The number of shares in Section 2 has also been increased to reflect the adjustments related to the special dividend payable December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004.
 

Exhibit 10.4
 
 
1.
Purpose
 
The purpose of the Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan") is to attract and retain the services of experienced and knowledgeable independent directors of Microsoft Corporation (the "Corporation") for the benefit of the Corporation and its stockholders and to provide additional incentive for such directors to continue to work for the best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders through continuing ownership of its common stock.
 
2.
Shares Subject to the Plan
 
The total number of shares of common stock ("Shares"), of the Corporation for which options may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed 36,033,332 in the aggregate, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 12 hereof. Within the foregoing limitations, Shares for which options have been granted pursuant to the Plan but which options have lapsed or otherwise terminated shall become available for the grant of additional options. There will initially be reserved for issuance or transfer from the Corporation's treasury upon the exercise of options granted under the Plan 36,033,332 Shares, subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 13 hereof.
 
3.
Administration of Plan
 
All aspects of the Plan relating to non-discretionary options shall be administered by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. All aspects of the Plan relating to the grant of discretionary options pursuant to Section 5, and all administrative functions relating to discretionary options, shall be handled by a Board committee of two or more directors, each of whom is a "disinterested person" (as that term is defined in Rule 16b-3(c)(2) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to its authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The Board of the Committee, as the case may be, shall have the power to construe the Plan and the terms of the Shares, to determine all questions arising thereunder, and to adopt and amend such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as it may deem desirable; provided that, no consent of an option holder is necessary where the modification, amendment, acceleration, or deferral in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit on the option holder, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 13. References to the "Board" in this Plan shall be deemed to refer to either the Board or the Committee, whichever is appropriate in the context in which the word is used.
 
4.
Grant of Non-Discretionary Options
 
Each director who (a) satisfies all of the following criteria:
 
(i) such person is not, and has not during the immediately preceding 12 month period been, an employee of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation;
 
(ii) such person does not own any common stock of the Corporation which (x) he acquired directly from the Corporation and (y) is currently subject to any contractual provision whereby such stock is either forfeitable or subject to mandatory resale to the Corporation on the occurrence of certain specified events; and
(iii) such person does not hold any unvested stock options to purchase common stock of the Corporation, except for non-discretionary stock options previously granted pursuant to this Section 4 of the Plan.
 
and (b) who is in office on November 30 of any year (commencing with November 30, 1989) shall, on the immediately succeeding January 1, automatically be granted an option to acquire 5,000 Shares under the Plan.

No options under this Section 5 may be granted for more than 50,000 shares. An option under this Section 5 must be granted either on the date the new director is first elected as a director or on a prior date, but any option granted on a prior date shall be conditioned on the election of the optionee as a director. No director shall be eligible for an option grant under this Section 5 after the date he is first elected as a director.
 
6.
Option Agreement
 
Each option granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an option agreement (the "Agreement") duly executed on behalf of the Corporation and by the director to whom such option is granted, which Agreements may but need not be identical and which shall (i) comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and (ii) provide that the director agrees to continue to serve as a director of the Corporation during the term for which he or she was elected. Any Agreement may contain such other terms, provisions, and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board. No option shall be deemed granted within the meaning of the Plan and no purported grant of any option shall be effective, until such Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Corporation and the director to whom the option is to be granted.
 
7.
Option Exercise Price
 
(a) The option exercise price for a non-discretionary option granted pursuant to Section 4 of the Plan shall be the fair market value of the Shares covered by the option on the date of grant, or, if such date is not a day on which Shares are traded, on the trading day (the "Pricing Date"), immediately preceding the date on which the option is granted.
 
(b) The option exercise price for a discretionary option granted pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan shall be set by the Board in its discretion.
 
(c) For purposes hereof, the fair market value of the Shares covered by an option shall be the closing price of the Shares on the applicable date as reported in the National Market List of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc.

Time and Manner of Exercise of Option

(b) The exercisability of discretionary options pursuant to Section 5 of the Plan shall be set by the Board in its discretion and shall be memorialized in the Agreement between the Corporation and the director to whom the option is granted.
 
(c) To the extent that the right to exercise an option has accrued and is in effect, the option may be exercised from time to time, by giving written notice, signed by the person or persons exercising the option, to the Corporation, stating the number of Shares with respect to which the option is being exercised, accompanied by payment in full for such Shares, which payment may be in whole or in part in shares of the common stock of the Corporation already owned by the person or persons exercising the option, valued at fair market value on the date of payment (as determined pursuant to Section 7(c) hereof).
 
(d) Upon exercise of the option, delivery of a certificate for fully paid and non-assessable Shares shall be made at the principal office of the Corporation in the State of Washington to the person or persons exercising the option as soon as practicable (but in no event more than 30 days) after the date of receipt of the notice of exercise by the Corporation, or at such time, place, and manner as may be agreed upon by the Corporation and the person or persons exercising the option.

(a) In the event of the death of an option holder, the option granted to such person may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date of death pursuant to Section 8(a) or (b), by the estate of such person, or by any person or persons who acquired the right to exercise such option by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Such option may be exercised at any time within 180 days after the date of death of such person or prior to the date on which the option expires by its terms, whichever is earlier.
 
(b) In the event that an option holder ceases to be a director of the Corporation, other than by reason of his or her death, the option granted to such person may be exercised, to the extent exercisable on the date such person ceases to be a director, for a period of 30 days after such date, or prior to the date on which the option expires by its terms, whichever is earlier.
 
10.
Merger, Consolidation, Sale of Assets, etc., Resulting in a Change in Control
 
(a) In the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8 and 9, an option granted to a director pursuant to the Plan shall become fully exercisable if, within one year of such Change in Control, such director shall cease for any reason to be a member of the Board. For purposes hereof, a Change in Control of the Corporation shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) there shall be consummated (x) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation in which the Corporation is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of the common stock of the Corporation would be converted into cash, securities, or other property, other than a merger of the Corporation in which the holders of the common stock of the Corporation immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger, or (y) any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Corporation; or (ii) the stockholders of the Corporation approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation; or (iii) any person (as such term is used in Sections

Gates, shall become the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common stock; or (iv) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the entire Board of Directors shall cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof unless the election, or the nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders, of each new director was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period.
 
(b) Any exercise of an option permitted pursuant to Section 10(a) shall be made within 180 days of the related director's termination as a director of the Corporation.
 
11.
Options Not Transferable

The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(ii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 13, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and (iii) the possibility that some option holders might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding options, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding options will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such options. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive.

In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation, an outstanding option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such
 
instances, declare that any option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each option holder the right to exercise an option as to all or any part of the stock covered by such option, including Shares as to which the option would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or the merger of the Corporation with or into another corporation, each option shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume each option or to substitute an equivalent option, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the option holder to have the right to exercise such option as to all of the stock covered by such option, including Shares as to which such option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the option holder that the option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Board shall have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to grant Nonqualified Stock Options; (ii) to determine, in accordance with Section 8(b) of the Plan, the fair market value of the Common Stock; (iii) to determine, in accordance with Section 8(a) of the Plan, the exercise price per share of Options to be granted, (iv) to determine the individuals to whom, and the time or times at which, options shall be granted and the number of Shares to be represented by each Option; (v) to interpret the Plan and the terms of Options; (vi) to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; (vii) to determine the terms and provisions of each Option granted (which need not be identical) and, with the consent of the holder thereof, modify or amend any Option; (viii) to reduce the exercise price per share of outstanding and unexercised Options; (ix) to accelerate or defer (with the consent of the Optionee) the vesting or exercise date of any Option; (x) to authorize any person to execute, on behalf of the Company, any instrument required to effectuate the grant of an Option previously granted by the Board; and (xi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; provided that, no consent of an Optionee is necessary under clauses (vii) or (ix) if the modification, amendment, acceleration, or deferral in the reasonable judgment of the Board confers a benefit upon the Optionee, or is made pursuant to an adjustment in accordance with Section 11.
Powers of the Board
 
(c) . All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of any Options granted under the Plan.
Effect of Board's Decision
 
5. .
Eligibility
 
(a) Options may be granted to consultants and advisors who provide consulting services to the Company. In no event shall any employees (full-time or part-time) of the Company be eligible for the grant of an Option under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the fact that an Optionee subsequently becomes an employee of the Company shall not affect such Optionee's Option, so long as the Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor was uninterrupted prior to his or her commencement of employment with the Company.
 
(b) Nothing in the Plan or any Option granted hereunder shall confer upon any Optionee any right to continue or require the continuance of the Optionee's consulting or advisory relationship with the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
 
6. . The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board and shall continue in effect for ten (10) years, unless sooner terminated under Section 14 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
 
7. . The term of each Option shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant.
Term of Option
 
8. .
Exercise Price and Consideration
 
(a) The per Share exercise price under each Option shall be such price as is determined by the Board, which price may be less than, equal to, or greater than the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation ("NASDAQ") National Market System on the date of grant. If the Common Stock ceases to be listed on the NASDAQ National Market System, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Common Stock.
 
(c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price.
 
(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Option, the Optionee shall pay any federal, state, and local withholding obligations of the Company, if applicable.
 
9. .
Exercise of Option
 
(a) . Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
 
An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the stock certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly upon exercise of the Option. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 11 of the Plan.
 
The exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(b) . In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor, such Optionee may exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of termination. Such exercise must occur within three (3) months (or such shorter time as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Termination of Consulting Relationship with Optionee
 
(c) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months), such Optionee may exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of termination. Such exercise must occur within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Termination of Consulting Relationship Due to Disability of Optionee
 
(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of the death of an Optionee:
Death of Optionee
 
(i) who is at the time of death a consultant or advisor to the Company, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's Personal Representative or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued as of the date of death; or
 
(ii) whose Option has not yet expired, but whose Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor terminated prior to the date of death, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's Personal Representative or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.
 
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) above, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an option beyond the date on which the option would have expired if no termination of the Optionee's Continuous Status as a Consultant or Advisor had occurred).
 
10. . The Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee.
Non-Transferability of Options
 
11. . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, and (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per share covered by outstanding Options under the Plan. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(ii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 11, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and (iii) the possibility that some Optionees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Options, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Options will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Options. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 11, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected "without receipt of consideration." Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reasons thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option.
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger
 
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Optionee the right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, the Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted
 
by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or to substitute an equivalent option, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Optionee to have the right to exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Stock, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Optionee that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
12. . The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Board makes the determination granting such Option. Notice of the determination shall be given to each consultant or advisor to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Time of Granting Options
 
13. . The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Options in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Options assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Options before and after the substitution.
Substitutions and Assumptions
 
14. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a) . The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 4 and 11, any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Options already granted and such Options shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
15. . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant to thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
16. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
 
[The number of shares in Section 3 has been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split in June 1992, the 2-for-1 stock splits in May 1994, November 1996, February 1998, March 1999 and February 2003, and the adjustments related to the special dividend payable December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004.]

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
 
On November 12, 2004, Microsoft furnished a Form 8-K under Item 7.01 to which it attached as an exhibit Microsoft Corporation's consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 formatted in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language).
 
Microsoft is filing this Amendment No. 1 to Form 8-K to make certain corrections to the first file included in Exhibit 99.1, the XBRL instance document containing information from Microsoft's FY2005 Q1 Form 10-Q in XBRL and referencing the attached XBRL taxonomies, schemas and linkbases. The corrections are: (i) a modified tag for one line item (CashDividendCommonStock) and (ii) corrected values for CommonStockSharesOutstanding and Issued; OtherComprehensiveIncome; RetainedEarningsEndingBalance and StockholdersEquityEndingBalance.
 
These corrections apply only to the voluntary Form 8-K furnished on November 12, 2004. These changes are not applicable to the Form 10-Q filed November 9, 2004.
 
These documents are presented for illustration purposes only. These are not the official publicly filed financial statements of Microsoft Corporation. No representation is made that the information presented is accurate or complete and they are not to be used for investment purposes.
 
The information in this report shall not deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies provide their financial statements in XBRL, it will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 200 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International Web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public working draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2003-07-07 ( available for download from the XBRL International Web site). XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the public working draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Both taxonomies are contained in this filing, and more information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K/A:

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Jan. 27, 2005
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced record revenue of $10.82 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, a 7% increase over the results in the same period of the prior year. Operating income for the second quarter was $4.75 billion, which was an increase of $3.27 billion over the same period in the prior year. The results of the second quarter of the prior year included $2.21 billion in compensation expense incurred in connection with the Employee Stock Option Transfer Program. Net income for the second quarter was $3.46 billion. Diluted earnings per share exceeded the company's guidance by $0.04 and were $0.32 including stock-based compensation expense.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 27, 2005 
 
"Our record revenue came from across-the-board strength in both our business and consumer segments" said John Connors, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "And our long-term approach to growing new businesses is paying off. Home and Entertainment delivered its first profitable quarter and all three of the company's emerging businesses combined generated a nearly $700 million improvement in operating results compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year."
 
The Server and Tools business grew 18% versus the prior year's comparable quarter. Customer adoption of SQL Server remains particularly robust with over 25% year over year revenue growth. During the quarter, Exchange 2003 marked its one-year product launch anniversary and has had the fastest adoption of Exchange licenses ever. Customers who acquired Microsoft server products during the quarter included Eastman Chemical Company, Hewlett-Packard Company, Morgan Stanley and Premera Blue Cross.
 
The Home and Entertainment segment delivered record revenue during the quarter and achieved positive operating income. "Our Xbox business fired on all cylinders and provided a strong ending to what was a great year for the platform and our partners," said Robbie Bach, senior vice president of the Home and Entertainment group. "Not only did we achieve record software sales with our strongest games lineup to date, but we also sold more consoles than our competitors
during the critical holiday sales season in the United States, and increased Xbox membership to over 1.4 million members." During the quarter, 6.3 million units of "Halo
Live
2" were sold, resulting in a game attach rate of over 30% to the Xbox installed base of almost 20 millions consoles.
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2005:

Attached as an exhibit to this report are the following materials from Microsoft Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, formatted in XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language): (i) the information contained in Item 1 (a)-(e) and Items 2, 3 and 4 of Part IFinancial Information, and (ii) the information contained in Items 1, 2 and 4 of Part IIOther Information. These materials are presented for illustration purposes only. These are not the official publicly filed financial statements of Microsoft Corporation. No representation is made that the information presented is accurate or complete, and they are not to be used for investment purposes.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report of Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
Overview of Providing XBRL Financial Statements
 
The XBRL version of the Microsoft financial statements are provided in this alternative format to provide global business information users with a more structured expression of the financial statements. XBRL is an XML-based schema created and maintained by XBRL International that allows business reporting data to be represented in a "digital language". XBRL streamlines the way companies report and publish their financial data, and how analysts and investors can review that information. With XBRL, financial data is tagged in a consistent format that allows the data to be easily transported and analyzed (by XBRL-aware applications). As more companies furnish quarterly and annual reports in this XML technology, XBRL will enhance the ability to more quickly understand the contents of financial statements (and business report information in general). The goal of XBRL is to provide an XML-based framework that global business information users will use to create, exchange, and analyze business reporting information.
 
Overview of XBRL International
 
XBRL International is a consortium comprised of over 250 organizations that was originally formed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") in 1999. Microsoft is one of the 13 "charter" companies that originally came together to discuss creating an XML-based standard for business reporting that eventually became XBRL. Additional information and background on XBRL and XBRL International can be found at the XBRL International Web site (www.xbrl.org).
 
Microsoft Financial Reporting in XBRL
 
The key to creating XBRL versions of financial information is the use of XBRL taxonomies (or dictionaries). For this filing, Microsoft has used the public Acknowledged Draft of the US GAAP CI (Commercial and Industrial) taxonomy dated 2004-08-15, based on version 2.1 of the XBRL specification (available for download from the XBRL International Web site). XBRL taxonomies are collections of terms and mathematical and presentation relationships of financial reporting concepts. In addition to the Acknowledged Draft of the US GAAP CI taxonomy, Microsoft also created an extension taxonomy that extends the terms found in the US GAAP CI taxonomy. Only the Microsoft taxonomy (msft-fin) is contained in this filing. More information can be found in the "Instructions" section below.
 
Instructions
 
The present EDGAR system does not allow the receipt of XBRL/XML files unless it is in an altered form. The XBRL specification requires use of tags that are not permitted in an EDGAR filing. Therefore, Microsoft has embedded all of the required XBRL documents as either .JPG or .GIF files to conform to the present EDGAR system.
 
In order to submit the XBRL documents as part of this Form 8-K, the following changes have been made to the Microsoft and XBRL International XBRL XML files:
 
 
 
The following is a complete listing of all files attached to this Form 8-K:
 
 
 
Questions related specifically to Microsoft's creation and filing of XBRL financial statements, or general questions related to XBRL, can be emailed to (mohata@microsoft.com).

On April 28, 2005, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
(A) EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $9.62 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, a 5% increase over the results in the same period of the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter was $3.33 billion, compared to $1.28 billion in the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter includes $768 million related to legal charges, compared to $2.53 billion in legal charges in the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.56 billion and $0.23 per share, which included $0.05 of legal charges. For the previous year, net income and earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.32 billion and $0.12 per share, which included $0.17 of legal charges. Operating income, net income, and earnings per share amounts include stock based compensation expense.
REDMOND, Wash.  April 28, 2005 
 
"Despite a mixed enterprise software environment, the quarter played out largely as we expected and operating income and earnings per share results were in line with our expectations," said Scott Di Valerio, corporate vice president and corporate controller at Microsoft. "Given our optimism about the future with our strong product pipeline and the growth opportunities from our investments in innovative products and services, we expect increased revenue growth in fiscal 2006."
 
Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by a healthy Server and Tools business. Third quarter revenue growth for the segment of 12% over the prior year resulted from double-digit growth in the SQL Server and Exchange Server product lines. Customers who acquired Microsoft server products during the quarter include Continental Airlines, First Horizon National Corporation, and LendingTree, LLC.
 
During the quarter, Microsoft announced significant new real-time communication and collaboration capabilities for the Microsoft Office System of products, servers, and services. With the acquisition of Groove Networks, Microsoft customers can now turn to their trusted supplier of Microsoft Office software for real-time, server-based, and peer-to-peer collaboration
 
solutions. Microsoft also introduced Microsoft Office Communicator 2005, the Microsoft Office Live Communications Server 2005 Service Pack, and Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2005.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue grew 31% over the prior year as Windows Mobile products experienced strong demand. Windows Mobile license sales for connected devices were more than double prior year levels while the Windows Mobile software platform continues to experience strong momentum with developers. There are currently over 380,000 active Windows Mobile professional developers and over 18,000 Windows Mobile applications.
 
The company repurchased more than 95 million shares of common stock for $2.42 billion during the quarter and has repurchased more shares year to date than it did for all of fiscal 2004. Overall, the company has returned $39 billion to investors during the fiscal year through share repurchases and dividends.
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2005:

Actual results could differ materially because of factors such as: entry into markets with vigorous competition, market acceptance of new products and services, continued acceptance of existing products and services, changes in licensing programs, product price discounts, delays in product development and related product release schedules, sales channel disruption such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, and reliance on sole source suppliers for key components of Xbox that could result in component shortages and delays in product delivery, any of which may cause revenues and income to fall short of anticipated levels; obsolete inventory or product returns by distributors, resellers and retailers; warranty and other claims on hardware products such as Xbox; changes in the rate of PC shipments; technological shifts; the support of third-party software developers for new or existing platforms; the availability of competitive products or services such as the Linux operating system at prices below our prices or for no charge; the ability to have access to distribution channels for MSN that are controlled by third parties; the risk of unanticipated increased costs for network services; the continued ability to protect the company's intellectual property rights; adverse effects on our business that might result if an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code were to occur; the ability to obtain on acceptable terms the right to incorporate in the company's products and services technology patented by others; changes in product and service mix; maturing product life cycles; product sale terms and conditions; the risk that actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenues; implementation of operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; unavailability of insurance; uninsured losses; adverse results in litigation; unanticipated tax liabilities; the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in our operations and security arrangements; the effects of a major earthquake, cyber-attack or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems; the level of corporate information technology spending and changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software; currency fluctuations; and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $10.16 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, a 9% increase over the results in the same period of the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $2.99 billion, compared to $3.13 billion in the prior year. Operating income for the fourth quarter includes $756 million related to legal charges for antitrust-related claims.
REDMOND, Wash.July 21, 2005
 
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $3.70 billion and $0.34 per share, which included $0.05 of legal charges and $0.09 of tax benefits. For the previous year, net income and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.69 billion and $0.25 per share, which included a $0.02 tax benefit.
 
Operating income, net income, and earnings per share amounts for the quarter and for the full year include stock-based compensation expense.
 
The company also announced record revenue of $39.79 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, an 8% increase over the $36.84 billion reported last year. Net income for fiscal year 2005 was $12.25 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.12, which included legal charges of $0.13 and tax benefits of $0.09. For the previous fiscal year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $8.17 billion and $0.75, which included legal charges of $0.17 and a tax benefit of $0.02.
 
"We closed out a record fiscal year with strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter driven by healthy, broad-based demand across all customer segments and channels," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "While continuing to invest in the business, we also returned $44 billion to investors through share repurchases and dividends during the fiscal year. These results provide solid momentum heading into fiscal 2006, which is shaping up to be a strong year for growth and investment. We expect double digit revenue growth next year, kicking off the strongest multi-year product pipeline in the company's history."
 
Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by continued strength in the Server and Tools business. Rapid customer adoption of Microsoft SQL Server
TM
product resulted in double digit revenue growth of 16% over the same quarter of the prior year. This marks the third consecutive year that the Server and Tools business has delivered double digit revenue growth and improved profitability.
 
Strong results across all aspects of the Xbox business resulted in 22% revenue growth for the Home and Entertainment division, providing a great finish to an excellent year. In fiscal 2005 Home and Entertainment shipped a record number of Xbox consoles and software, doubled the number of Xbox Live members, and unveiled the Xbox 360 future-generation video game and entertainment system.
 
Business Outlook
 
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2006:

Summary
 
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Our revenue increase for the three months ended June 30, 2005 was driven primarily by increased licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, increase in Xbox revenue, growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), as well as favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During the fourth quarter, continued strong PC and server shipment growth and improved information technology (IT) spending compared to fiscal year 2004 contributed to our overall revenue growth. Based on our preliminary estimates, the total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 14% to 16% from the fourth quarter of the previous year driven by strong business demand in both emerging and mature markets. We estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Foreign exchange rates also contributed approximately $210 million or two percentage points growth in total revenue for the quarter primarily due to relative strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall exposure. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non-OEM commercial and retail license business because a significant percentage of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. The vast majority of OEM license revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. The revenue growth was partially offset by a $195 million decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.
 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, the operating income decrease was primarily driven by an increase in legal costs due to charges of $756 million for antitrust-related claims, including $626 million for a settlement with IBM, and an increase in sales and marketing costs mainly related to advertising and launch campaigns. The cost increases were partially offset by the increase in revenue.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Our revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server operating systems and other server applications, licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. The license revenue growth resulted from growth in server hardware and PC shipments, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and overall improvements in IT spending. The November 2004 launch of the "Halo 2" Xbox game also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company. Based on our preliminary estimates, worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew
 
about 11% to 13% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 as compared with fiscal year 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the Euro and Japanese Yen, against the U.S. dollar. Had the exchange rates from the previous year been in effect in fiscal year 2005, translated international revenue growth earned in local currencies would have been approximately $873 million or two percentage points lower for fiscal year 2005. Partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a $1.1 billion decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage in fiscal year 2005. The Upgrade Advantage contract value reached its expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. This revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003, fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired.
 
For fiscal year 2005, the operating income increase was driven by a decline in stock-based compensation expense; increased revenue in Server and Tools, Client and Information Worker, which have higher gross margins as compared with other segments; and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation. In addition, strong sales of "Halo 2" reduced the overall operating loss for the Home and Entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005. The $3.29 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. General and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the settlement of Sun Microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the European Commission in fiscal year 2004. This effect was partially offset by legal expenses of $2.08 billion related to settlements with Novell, Gateway Inc., Burst.com, IBM and certain class plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters.
 
In fiscal year 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher to JPMorgan. The unvested options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. A total of 344.6 million of the 621.4 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. As a result of these changes, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to decrease in future periods.
 
The following table shows total stock-based compensation expense by segment and by income statement classification for the fourth quarter and full year ended June 30, 2005, and the comparable previous year periods.
 
 
In fiscal year 2006, we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2005, mainly due to the launches of new products. We expect higher revenue growth in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005 in Home and Entertainment primarily driven by the launch of Xbox 360, our new gaming platform. We estimate PC shipments will grow between 7% and 9% and Server unit shipments will grow between 11% and 13% in fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005. We do not expect a benefit from year-over-year foreign exchange rates in fiscal year 2006.
 
We expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2006 to exceed our revenue growth rate. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than occurred in fiscal year 2005 and reduction in stock-based compensation expense. The operating loss for Home and Entertainment is expected to increase in fiscal year 2006 driven by the launch of and investments in Xbox 360.
 
 
Our seven segments are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment.
 
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Fiscal year 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifying certain legal settlements from business segments to corporate-level expense.
 
Client
 
 
Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that preinstall versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The increase in Client revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was driven by an 18% growth in OEM licenses and $312 million or 14% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $33 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. OEM unit growth outpaced market growth due primarily to OEM customer purchase patterns. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the quarter declined one percentage point to 53% of total OEM Windows operating systems compared to the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from quarter to quarter are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the quarter, changes in the geographical mix, the channel mix of products sold by large, multinational OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, and previous deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue.
 
Client operating income increase for the three months ended June 30, 2005 was primarily due to the increase in OEM revenue, partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with "Start Something," a globally launched advertising campaign for Windows and increase in research and development expenses related to product development and increased headcount.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
The increase in Client revenue in fiscal year 2005 was driven by 12% growth in OEM license units and $886 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the year remained flat at 50% of total OEM Windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. Revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the year, changes in the geographical mix, the channel mix of products sold by large, multinational OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, and previous changes to deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue.
 
The increase in Client operating income in fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in OEM revenue and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. These factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with "Start Something," a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. The additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of the Windows Client next-generation operating system. The operating income for fiscal year 2004 has been restated for a reclassification of $700 million of legal settlement charges from Client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation.
 
Server and Tools
 
 
Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. The Server and Tools segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including preinstalled OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multiyear volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customer segments. The Server and Tools segment uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software. The operating results for previous years have been restated for the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client and the reorganization of Professional product support services from Information Worker to Server and Tools.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The increase in Server and Tools revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in Server and Server application revenue, especially SQL Server, and Core CAL revenue. We estimate that overall server
 
shipments grew approximately 10% to 11% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year, driving double-digit growth in Windows Server revenue. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $292 million or 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2004, despite a $56 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $65 million or 19% compared with the previous year, primarily due to higher consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $73 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth.
 
The increase in Server and Tools operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2005 was primarily due to the increase in revenue and reduction in stock-based compensation expense, which were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs from increased hiring in sales and marketing and increases in salary and benefits. The increase in operating income also was offset by an increase in research and development costs associated with product development for upcoming products such as SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Server and Tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 was mainly driven by growth in Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, which grew $1.1 billion or 17% in fiscal year 2005 reflecting broad adoption of Windows Server System products, including Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server and Management Servers. We estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 and that Windows-based server shipments grew at a comparable rate for the same period. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $241 million or 19% compared with the previous year, primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $284 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth, which was offset by a $314 million decline in Upgrade Advantage revenue earned.
 
Server and Tools operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits. Operating income for the previous year has been restated for a reclassification of $1.22 billion of legal settlements from Server and Tools to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation.
 
Information Worker
 
 
Information Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services and solutions designed to increase personal, team and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document life-cycle management, collaboration and business intelligence. Beginning in fiscal year 2005, the Small and Mid-Market Solutions & Partners (SMS&P) organization, which was historically part of the Information Worker segment, was realigned in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. As a result of this change, Information Worker segment
 
information has been restated to reflect the reclassification of the SMS&P organization to Microsoft Business Solutions. The results for previous periods have also been restated due to the reclassification of product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The increase in Information Worker revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2005 was primarily attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, growth in the underlying volume licensing, growth in retail packaged products, and growth in preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, which were partially offset by the absence of $123 million of Upgrade Advantage earned revenue in the comparable period of fiscal year 2004. The changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $89 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for the quarter as compared with the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year. Revenue for volume licensing, retail packaged product, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan increased 2% or $50 million, and OEM revenue increased 6% or $22 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 as compared with the corresponding period in previous year.
 
The decrease in Information Worker operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2005 was primarily due to increases in sales and marketing costs mainly associated with introduction of the "New Era" advertising campaign in additional geographic markets and an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring supporting field sales efforts and general increases in salary and benefits. Sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 was low because advertising costs were weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year as a result of the campaigns coinciding with the launch of Office 2003.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Information Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a 3% or $269 million increase in volume licensing, retail packaged product, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, a 6% or $91 million increase in OEM revenue, and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by reduced Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Changes in foreign exchange rates accounted for approximately $367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 as compared with the previous fiscal year, offset by a $663 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue.
 
Information Worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of Office 2003. This decline was offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
 
Microsoft Business Solutions provides integrated and adaptable business management software solutions optimized for small and midsize businesses, large organizations and divisions of global enterprises. Microsoft Business Solutions products are developed to deliver affordable and rich functionality through an adaptable software platform that works like and with other Microsoft technologies. The main products consist of a line of business solutions, customer relationship management software, retail solutions and related services, as well as the Microsoft Partner Program. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of our total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and
 
enhancements plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered though a worldwide network of channel partners that provide specialized services and local support tailored to customer needs. The market for Microsoft Business Solutions is highly competitive, with a few strong players in the enterprise segment while the midmarket segment is more fragmented. Microsoft Business Solutions now includes the SMS&P organization, which previously had been included in Information Worker. SMS&P supports small and midmarket customers for Microsoft including Microsoft Business Solutions. Results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of SMS&P for all periods presented. Also as a result of the reorganization, the Microsoft Partner Program became a component of Microsoft Business Solutions.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2005, as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year, was primarily due to 12% growth in software revenue partially offset by a 16% decline in services revenue, which resulted from encouraging our partners to provide more of these types of services. Performance from our line of business solutions, our customer relationship management solution, and the Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions resulted in growth of 12% in both license and enhancement revenue.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 increased from the corresponding period in fiscal year 2004 mainly due to a net increase in sales and marketing expenses related to investments in SMS&P. The increase in operating expense was partially offset by higher Microsoft Business Solutions product revenue.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
The increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to 10% revenue growth in software partially offset by a 25% decline in services revenue, which resulted from encouraging our partners to provide more of these types of services. The software revenue increase was driven by 9% growth in license revenue and 16% growth in enhancement revenue as compared with the previous year, and is attributed to growth in our line of business solutions and customer relationship management solutions, as well as increased Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions.
 
Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a decline in stock-based compensation expense, an increase in product revenue, and a decline in acquisition amortization. The reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental headcount and marketing costs in the SMS&P organization. In addition, there has been an increase in marketing and product development investments in our portfolio of business solutions.
 
MSN
 
 
MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. In fiscal year 2005, we launched a new version of our MSN Search engine, which is based on our own technology. This change
 
will help provide the ability to innovate more quickly and the opportunity to develop a long-term competitive advantage in search. In addition to the launch of MSN Search, we introduced many new products and product enhancements in fiscal year 2005, including a new version of the MSN home page, which provides a richer user experience, quicker load times, higher levels of end-user customization, and fewer advertisements and links. MSN launched the clarity in advertising program in fiscal year 2005, which eliminated paid inclusion and resulted in a reduced number of advertisements that are returned with search results.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
The decrease in MSN revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 resulted from a decline of $90 million or 41% in Internet Access revenue, as subscribers migrate to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers, partially offset by an increase in MSN advertising revenue. Advertising revenue increased $73 million or 22% from the previous year due primarily to display advertising revenue driven by MSN Hotmail and MSN Instant Messenger and a true-up for performance-based advertising revenue. Revenue from subscriptions and transactions services other than Internet Access increased $11 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 to $48 million.
 
The increase in MSN operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2005 was due primarily to a reduction in operational costs and customer acquisition costs along with a reduction in revenue from the Internet Access business. In addition, sales and marketing expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 were relatively higher than the current period.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
In fiscal year 2005, MSN advertising revenue increased $193 million or 16% primarily as a result of industry and market growth, and continued growth of MSN display advertising revenue, tempered by the search clarity in advertising program and the impact of the homepage redesign. Revenue from subscription and transaction services other than Internet Access increased $84 million or 88% in fiscal year 2005 as a result of growth in the number of MSN Premium subscribers through our carrier partnerships. Offsetting the overall revenue growth was a decline of $219 million or 24% in Internet Access revenue, driven by the continued migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. At the end of the current fiscal year, MSN had 2.7 million Internet access subscribers compared with 4.3 million at the end of the previous fiscal year and 9.1 million total subscribers compared with 8.8 million at the end of the previous year. In addition, MSN has over 420 million unique users monthly, over 205 million active Hotmail accounts, and over 175 million active Messenger accounts.
 
In fiscal year 2005, MSN operating income increased mainly due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, reduced online operations and bandwidth costs associated with the Internet Access business, and increased advertising and subscription revenue. The operating income increase was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits, and a $48 million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible
 
for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers, such as wireless, fixed and cable and wireless operators, and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and noncommercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to strength in Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems driven by increased shipments of connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs, Smartphones, and standalone PDAs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $13 million or 43%, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $7 million or 27%, and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $7 million or 50%.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2005 decreased compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to growth in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense. These improvements have been partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs for new and existing headcount.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, and strong growth in volume shipments for standalone PDAs. The increase in Windows Embedded revenue was due to our operating system being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. The segment also benefited from the increased demand for online mapping and the introduction of new MapPoint finished goods products. This new functionality resulted in increased unit sales for Mobile, Embedded and MapPoint product categories. In fiscal year 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $46 million or 45%, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $19 million or 21%, and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $25 million or 45%. Mobile and Embedded Devices realized positive increases in customer satisfaction ratings from both mobile operator partners and the developer community. In fiscal year 2005, Mobile and Embedded Devices released Windows Mobile 5.0, which is the latest version of our mobile operating software.
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for fiscal year 2005 decreased compared with fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The growth in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense also drove improved operating results in this period compared with the previous year. This improvement has been partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased hiring and increased investment in research and development.
 
Home and Entertainment
 
 
Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the market share of the console. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since we entered the market in 2002, and we have established ourselves as one of the market leaders. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, which provides higher margins to offset the declining prices on consoles sold. Xbox consoles have negative gross margins.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Home and Entertainment revenue increased in the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in Xbox revenue. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, Xbox revenue increased $123 million or 46% mainly due to an increase in revenue from first- and third-party games, and an increase in Xbox Live memberships. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms decreased $11 million or 5% compared with fiscal year 2004 primarily due to lower PC games software sales.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss for the three months ended June 30, 2005, decreased compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to increased high-margin Xbox software sales, improved console unit costs, and an approximately $90 million lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment related to the Xbox console recorded in fiscal year 2004. These reductions in operating losses were partially offset by an increase in development and launch investments related to Xbox 360, our new gaming platform.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Home and Entertainment revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to significant new product launches, which resulted in a $416 million or 23% increase in Xbox revenue. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we introduced "Halo 2," which generated over $300 million in revenue in the fiscal year. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms declined $50 million or 5% compared with fiscal year 2004 due to lower PC games software sales.
 
Home and Entertainment operating loss in fiscal year 2005 decreased primarily due to an increase in high- margin Xbox software sales, lower Xbox console unit costs, the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment recorded in fiscal year 2004, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with Xbox 360 console development and launch efforts associated with it.
 
Corporate-Level Expenses
 
 
Certain corporate-level expenses are not allocated to our segments. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses include all litigation settlements and accruals.
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Corporate-level expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 increased as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to an increase in legal costs because of charges of $756 million for
 
antitrust-related claims, including $626 million for a settlement with IBM, and an increase in headcount-related costs associated with increase in employee development, salary and benefits for new and existing headcount.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
In fiscal year 2005, corporate-level expenses decreased primarily as a result of a reduction in stock-based compensation expense and decreased corporate legal costs. Fiscal year 2005 legal costs were $2.08 billion as compared with $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2004. The costs in both years were primarily related to antitrust and competition law claims brought by competitors, class actions on behalf of end users, and government regulatory bodies outside the United States.
 
Cost of Revenue
 
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the cost of revenue declined as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year mainly due to a $114 million reduction in product costs associated with Home and Entertainment and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense, which was partially offset by increased consulting services costs. In addition to a decrease in the cost of revenue in fiscal 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense, the cost of revenue decreased due to a $140 million reduction in costs primarily associated with the MSN Internet Access business and a $169 million reduction in product costs mainly due to Xbox consoles cost efficiency in Home and Entertainment, partially offset by increased costs in product support and consulting services costs.
 
Research and Development
 
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, research and development costs increased as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year mainly due to a $62 million increase in headcount-related costs and a $76 million increase in product development costs associated with upcoming product launches. This has been partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense. Our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense. This expense decline was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs associated with incremental hiring and product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the Xbox 360 console and related games, SQL Server 2005, the Windows Client next-generation operating system, and product development in Mobile and Embedded devices.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 increased as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year due to incremental hiring, an increase in other headcount-related costs, and an increase in product planning and marketing campaign expenses mainly related to the "Start Something" campaign for Windows, the New Era campaign for Office and launch of Xbox 360. For fiscal year 2005, sales and marketing expense increased slightly due to $470 million higher headcount-related costs from hiring and salary increases, higher sales and marketing costs driven by product planning, reseller marketing and advertising campaign costs mainly related to launch of the "Start Something" campaign, launch of "Halo 2" and launch arrangements for Xbox 360. The increase was offset mainly by reductions in stock-based compensation expense.
 
General and Administrative
 
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount, as well as legal costs and other administrative fees. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, general and administrative expenses increased as compared with the corresponding period in the previous year mainly due to an increase in legal costs resulting from a charge of $756 million for antitrust-related claims, including $626 million for a settlement with IBM. General and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to lower legal costs and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in other headcount-related costs from new and existing employees of $25 million. In fiscal year 2005, our legal expenses were driven by charges of $2.08 billion nearly all of which were for settlements of certain antitrust claims with IBM, Novell, Gateway, and in end-user class actions, and increases in contingency reserves for antitrust-related claims.
 
Investment Income and Income Taxes
 
Investment Income
 
The components of investment income and other in each fiscal year are as follows:
 
 
Fourth Quarter
 
Dividends and interest income declined $33 million in the three months ended June 30, 2005, due to the payment of the $32.64 billion special dividend on Dec. 2, 2004. Net gains on investments declined $228 million in the three months ended June 30, 2005, due primarily to fewer sales of investments as compared with the previous fiscal year. Net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $20 million in the three months ended June 30, 2005, compared with $16 million in the three months ended June 30, 2004. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash-flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
 
Derivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net derivative gains in the three months ended June 30, 2005, were primarily related to gains on equity derivatives and foreign currency contracts. During the three months ended June 30, 2005, gains related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $80 million. These gains were offset by the combination of realized losses on sales of securities and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net gains related to foreign currency contracts were $84 million, related in part to economically hedging foreign-currency-based investment exposures while the U.S. dollar generally increased against certain currencies. Gains related to hedging foreign-currency-based investment exposures were offset by unrealized losses in the underlying assets. Net derivative losses in the three months ended June 30, 2004, were primarily due to the impact of interest rate increases on interest rate derivative instruments and foreign currency movements relative to certain foreign currency positions used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue.
 
Full Fiscal Year
 
Dividends and interest income declined $432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a higher allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes in preparation for the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on Dec. 2, 2004, and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend.
 
Net gains on investments declined $707 million in fiscal year 2005 due primarily to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on Dec. 2, 2004. Net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared with $82 million in fiscal year 2004.
 
Net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. During fiscal year 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $53 million. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $53 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the U.S. dollar generally declined against most currencies during the current fiscal year, and economically hedging foreign-currency-based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign-currency-based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. Net gains on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains on commodity positions were $46 million during fiscal year 2005.
 
Net losses on equity investees and other for the previous periods were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation.
 
Income Taxes
 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was 4% and for full fiscal year 2005 was 26%. The decreased rate for the fourth quarter and full year resulted primarily from the reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an Internal Revenue Service examination for fiscal years 19971999 and a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 was 27% and for full fiscal year 2004 was 33%. The decreased rate for the fourth quarter resulted from the reversal of previously accrued taxes associated with resolving the remaining tax matters related to fiscal years before 1997.
 
Financial Condition
 
Cash and short-term investments totaled $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2005, compared with $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. The decline is primarily attributable to the special dividend of $3.00 per share, or $32.64 billion, paid on Dec. 2, 2004, and to common stock repurchases of 312 million shares for $8.00 billion during 2005. Equity and other investments were $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2005, compared to $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-currency-denominated positions to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $12.30 billion at June 30, 2005. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
 
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. Other unearned revenue includes Services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, and advertising and subscription services in which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
 
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2005 increased $1.23 billion from March 31, 2005, reflecting current period billings outpacing the recognition of deferrals from multi-year licensing arrangements by $1.15 billion and a $119 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services, MSN advertising and Microsoft Business Solutions, partially offset by a $42 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements.
 
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue at June 30, 2005:
 
 
Cash Flows
 
Our cash and short-term investments balance of $37.75 billion remained relatively flat from March 31, 2005. Cash flows from operations totaling $3.98 billion and $1.47 billion in cash provided from common stock issuances were mostly offset by cash dividends totaling $859 million and common stock repurchases of $4.31 billion.

(c) On August 4, 2005, Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") issued a press release to announce that B. Kevin Turner, age 40, is joining Microsoft as Chief Operating Officer, beginning September 8, 2005. Prior to joining Microsoft, Mr. Turner was Executive Vice President and President and Chief Executive Officer of the SAM'S CLUB division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. From September 2001 to August 2002, he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer of Wal-Mart's Information Systems Division. From March 2000 to September 2001, he served as its Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer of the Information Systems Division.
 
Mr. Turner's employment at Microsoft will be at-will. He will receive a salary of $570,000 per year. He will be eligible for an annual performance bonus ranging from 0% to 100% of eligible salary. In addition, Mr. Turner will participate in Microsoft's Shared Performance Stock Award ("SPSA") Program, with a target SPSA award of 624,000 shares of Microsoft common stock. The actual size of the award will be determined based on the company's performance against the program measures.
 
In connection with his employment, Mr. Turner will be eligible to receive benefits under Microsoft's executive relocation assistance program, including having Microsoft arrange for a third party to purchase his current primary residence at its appraised value if it is not sold as of a mutually agreed date.
 
To replace equity compensation Mr. Turner forfeited upon leaving his previous employer, Mr. Turner will receive a stock award for 320,000 shares of Microsoft common stock that will vest 25% on September 1, 2008, 25% on September 1, 2010, and 50% upon retirement from the company at age sixty or older, and an on-hire payment of $7,000,000. If Mr. Turner leaves the company voluntarily or due to termination for cause before completing 12 months of employment, 100% of the $7,000,000 must be returned to Microsoft. If he leaves the company voluntarily or due to termination for cause after completing 12 months but before completing 24 months of employment, $4,700,000 of the on-hire payment must be returned to Microsoft.

VIA AIR COURIER
Kevin Turner

Dear Kevin:
 
Microsoft Corporation is pleased to confirm our offer for the position of Chief Operating Officer reporting to Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer. We anticipate that you will start your employment on September 8, 2005.
 
Microsoft has extended this offer to you based upon your general knowledge, background, experience and skills and abilities and not because of your knowledge of your current employer's or any previous employer's trade secrets or other confidential information. As a condition of employment at Microsoft, you will be required to sign the standard form Microsoft Corporation Employee Agreement (copy enclosed) in which you agree to, among other things, not disclose to Microsoft or use in your employment with Microsoft any confidential or proprietary information or trade secrets of any current or prior employer. In this regard, you should be extremely careful not to bring to Microsoft any documents or other materials in tangible form belonging to or acquired from your current or any prior employer.
 
. Consistent with the company's philosophy of pay for performance, a significant portion of your annual compensation will be provided through performance-based components. The compensation package associated with this offer is as follows:
Annual Compensation
 
Your starting salary will be $570,000 per year, equivalent to approximately $47,500 per month. Currently, our performance review process provides for an annual merit increase opportunity, and any increase would be based on performance. Your first salary review will take place in September 2006. Any subsequent salary reviews will occur according to the performance review timetable in place for Microsoft employees at that time.
 
You also will be eligible for the Partnership bonus program. The bonus is awarded based on performance as evaluated during the performance review process. The bonus potential ranges from 0-100% of your eligible earnings during the review period. Your first eligibility for a bonus will be September 2006. Any subsequent bonus eligibility will occur according to the performance review timetable in place for Microsoft employees at that time.
 
You will participate in Microsoft's Shared Performance Stock Award (SPSA) program, our long-term incentive compensation plan for senior managers and officers, with a target SPSA award of 624,000 shares. The actual size of the award will be determined based on the company's performance against the program measures. One third of the SPSA award vests on or about August 31, 2006 (following the determination of results for the performance period), with an additional one-third vesting in each of the following two years, subject to continued employment through each vesting date. Upon vesting, you will be issued shares of Microsoft common stock, with shares withheld to pay required withholding taxes. Your SPSA award is subject to approval by the Compensation Committee of the Microsoft Board of Directors and will be governed by the terms and conditions of an award agreement that you will be required to sign as a condition of the award and by the terms of the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan. Additional materials regarding the SPSA program and your award will be provided to you approximately 60 days after you commence employment at Microsoft.
 
You will be eligible for vacation in accordance with Microsoft policy, as well as participation in the Company's benefit plans (the company currently provides a flexible benefits plan, 401(k) savings plan and employee stock purchase plan). In addition you will be eligible to participate in all other executive compensation and/or employee benefit programs on the same terms and conditions that are available to other senior executives at your level.
. Microsoft will provide you with the relocation benefits described in the enclosed Relocation Benefits Summary. As part of Microsoft's executive relocation assistance program, you are eligible for a third-party home sale purchase at its appraised value should your primary residence not be otherwise sold as of a mutually agreed date. The benefits include reimbursement for certain relocation costs in accordance with the company's reimbursement guidelines. Payroll taxes will be withheld; however, Microsoft will provide a tax gross up to assist you in paying the taxes associated with the lump sum cash relocation allowance and certain other non-deductible relocation expenses that will be included in your Form W-2 as gross compensation.
Relocation
 
. In addition, we recognize you are forfeiting a very significant amount of accumulated equity compensation when you leave your current employer. Accordingly, as a replacement for that compensation, we offer the following on-hire cash payment and Stock Award grant.
Replacement of Forfeited Compensation
 
An on-hire payment of $7,000,000 will be made to you within 14 days after our receipt of your signed letter, Employment Agreement and the other forms enclosed with this letter. This amount represents our genuine interest in your joining Microsoft. Payroll taxes will be withheld from the on-hire payment. In the unlikely event that you leave the company of your own volition or due to termination for cause by the company prior to completing 12 months of employment, 100% of the $7,000,000 must be returned to Microsoft. If you leave the company of your own volition or due to termination for cause by the company after completing 12 months but prior to completing 24 months of employment, $4,700,000 of the signing bonus must be returned to Microsoft. If you leave the company of your own volition or due to termination for cause by the company after completing 24 months but prior to completing 36 months of employment, $2,300,000 of the signing bonus must be returned to Microsoft. You hereby authorize Microsoft to withhold this amount from any monies owed or stock issuable to you. For purposes of this letter, "for cause" means a good faith determination by the company that: (a) you have engaged in material dishonesty, fraud, or theft in connection with the business of the company or its affiliates; (b) you have engaged in conduct in violation of policies of the company designed to prevent violations of law, such as, without limitation, policies pertaining to compliance with the laws prohibiting unlawful discrimination, harassment, or insider trading; (c) you have been convicted of, or pled nolo contendere to, a felony; (d) you have materially breached the terms of your Employee Agreement; (e) your employment with the company violates any obligation to any third party not to engage in such employment; or (f) you fail to perform your material duties as an employee.
 
You will be granted a Stock Award of 320,000 shares in Microsoft Corporation under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan. Subject to continued employment through each vesting date, this award will vest as follows:
 
 
 
 
Your Stock Award is subject to approval by the Compensation Committee of the Microsoft Board of Directors and will be subject to the terms of the Stock Award Agreement that you will be required to sign as a condition of the award and by the terms of the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan. Additional information regarding this Stock Award, including the Stock Award Agreement, will be provided to you approximately 60 days after you commence employment with Microsoft. Under our current program, you will not be eligible to be considered for future Stock Awards.
 
. If Microsoft terminates your employment for any reason other than "for cause" as defined above, the payback provisions of the $7,000,000 on-hire payment will become void (i.e., no payback of any portion of the on-hire payment will be required). Also, in the case of termination of employment by Microsoft for any reason other than "for cause," any portion of the Stock Award up to 160,000 shares that had not vested as of the date of such termination, will become immediately vested.
Termination of Employment by Microsoft
 
. If, during your employment, you die or if you become totally and permanently disabled so as to qualify for Long-Term Disability coverage as determined by Microsoft's Long-Term Disability policy in effect at the
Death or Disability
 
time of the disability event (as defined and determined under the policy), any portion of the Stock Award that had not vested will immediately vest. The forgoing vesting provision supersedes and replaces any provision of the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan concerning vesting.
 
Please recognize that this offer letter is not a contract of employment for any specific or minimum term and that the employment Microsoft offers you is terminable at will. This means that our employment relationship is voluntary and based on mutual consent. You may resign your employment, and Microsoft likewise may terminate your employment, at any time, for any reason, with or without cause or notice. Any prior oral or written representations to the contrary are void, and our at-will relationship may not be modified except by a formal written employment contract signed by an officer of Microsoft. Attached is an addendum which specifies that any dispute regarding this letter will be resolved through arbitration.
 
This offer is contingent on your providing us with acceptable proof of your identity and authorization to work in the United States and your proper completion of a Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) as required under U.S. immigration regulations. Enclosed is a listing provided by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service that describes what will be needed. This offer is also contingent upon the company receiving an acceptable check of your background, to include criminal convictions, confirmation of identification information, and credit history.
 
Please sign the copy of this letter and the enclosed Employee Agreement and promptly return them in the enclosed envelope. It is important that we receive your letter and the signed Employee Agreement prior to your start date. Please note that you are not authorized to alter the terms of the Employment Agreement in any manner. You may keep the original of this letter and a copy of the Employee Agreement for your records.
 
We believe you will make a substantial impact upon the future direction and success of our company. We look forward to your joining us. Should you have any questions, please give me a call.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Microsoft Realigns for Next Wave of Innovation and Growth
 
CEO Ballmer appoints presidents of three core divisions; Allchin announces retirement plan.
 
  In order to drive greater agility in the execution of its software and services strategy, Microsoft Corp. today announced a realignment of the company into three newly formed divisions, each of which will be led by its own president. The Microsoft Platform Products & Services Division will be led by Kevin Johnson and Jim Allchin as co-presidents; Jeff Raikes has been named president of the Microsoft Business Division; and Robbie Bach has been named as president of Microsoft Entertainment & Devices Division. In addition, the company said Ray Ozzie will expand his role as chief technical officer by assuming responsibility for helping drive its software-based services strategy and execution across all three divisions.
REDMOND, Wash.
Sept. 20, 2005
 
The company also announced that Allchin plans to retire at the end of calendar year 2006 following the commercial availability of Windows Vista, the next-generation Microsoft
Windows
operating system.
 
"These changes are designed to align our Business Groups in a way that will enhance decision-making and speed of execution, as well as help us continue to deliver the types of products and services our customers want most," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "It's great to have extremely successful broad leaders with strong track records in driving growth and innovation leading these three very important areas for the company. We see a new era of opportunity to provide greater value to our customers by weaving both software and services into forms that suit their needs. By bringing together the software experience and the service experience, we will better address the changing needs of our customers' digital lifestyles and the new world of work."
 
Microsoft Platform Products & Services Division
 
Johnson will succeed Allchin, taking ownership of the Microsoft Platform Products & Services Division, which comprises Windows Client, Server and Tools, and MSN
. To ensure a smooth transition, Johnson and Allchin will serve as co-presidents until Allchin's retirement next year. The new division's mission is to enable exciting user experiences and drive customer value through continued innovation in the software platform and software services delivered over the Internet.
 
"We are focused on creating exciting user experiences and enabling developers to build great applications with the combination of software and software-based services," Ballmer said. "Our MSN organization has great expertise in innovating quickly and delivering software-based services at scale. The platform groups have great expertise in creating a software platform and user experience that touches millions of people. By combining these areas of expertise, we will deliver greater value to our customers. David Cole, senior vice president, will continue to lead MSN, reporting to Johnson.
"I speak for the entire Microsoft family when I say how proud and appreciative we are of Jim's immeasurable impact on our success as a company and on the millions of customers who are able to reach their potential everywhere using our software," Ballmer added. "Jim is a key visionary and design architect who will help continue to lead us in the coming year."
 
"I absolutely love this company, and I am fully engaged in making great products," Allchin said. "My passion for Microsoft is as strong as ever. While I will call it a day at the end of next year after Windows Vista ships, I'm confident the world-class team of people I've been fortunate to work with will ensure we execute on our long-term mission."
 
The company also announced that Eric Rudder, senior vice president of Server and Tools, will be taking on a new role working directly for Bill Gates, chairman and chief software architect. Rudder will focus on some of the company's key advanced development efforts as well as overall technical strategy. Rudder will transition into his new role following the launch of Visual Studio
and SQL Server 2005 later this year.
 
"Eric has done a great job of driving broad usage of .NET with developers and has led incredible growth and success within our server and tools business," Ballmer said. "I look forward to having Eric apply his engineering talent and intellect in these new areas."
 
Microsoft Business Division
 
The Information Worker business and Microsoft Business Solutions (MBS) will combine to form the Microsoft Business Division, with Doug Burgum, senior vice president, reporting to Raikes. This division will deliver software and software-based services that enable organizations to succeed in today's constantly evolving workplace by amplifying the impact of their people. Microsoft is uniquely positioned for this opportunity with the new division's programs, servers and software-based services addressing the spectrum from structured business processes to personal productivity needs.
 
Microsoft Entertainment & Devices Division
 
The new Microsoft Entertainment & Devices Division, which combines the current Home and Entertainment Division with the current Mobile and Embedded Devices Division, will consolidate Microsoft's industry engagement around devices to deliver even richer and more relevant scenarios for individuals at work, at home and when they're mobile. It will also bring more focus to the company's efforts in entertainment and related devices and services. Accordingly, the senior vice president of Microsoft's Mobile and Embedded Devices Division, Pieter Knook, will report to Bach.
 
The Future
 
"As we head into the next 18 months of amazing releases driven by innovation in each of these three core areas, we are more excited than ever about our ability to help individuals and organizations large and small reach their full potential," Ballmer said. "With our 30-year heritage of delivering low-cost, high-volume products to market, no other company in the world is better positioned to deliver the software and services people and organizations need to achieve excellence."
Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $9.74 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2005, a 6% increase over revenue of $9.19 billion for the same period in the previous year. Operating income experienced 16% year-over-year growth for the first quarter to $4.05 billion, including a $361 million charge for the settlement with RealNetworks Inc. Operating income for the first quarter of the previous year of $3.49 billion included a charge of $536 million related to the Novell Inc. settlement.
REDMOND, Wash.  Oct. 27, 2005 
 
Net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.14 billion and $0.29 per share, including a $0.02 per share charge for the RealNetworks Inc. settlement. For the previous year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $2.53 billion and $0.23 per share, including a charge of $0.03 per share for the Novell settlement.
 
"We are optimistic about the company's future, and today I am happy to announce our plan to accelerate the remaining portion of our previously announced stock repurchase program," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Our goal is to execute the $19 billion remaining under our buy-back plan twice as quickly, finishing no later than December 2006."
 
Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by healthy demand for Microsoft's core platform software and by growth in PC and server shipments. Server and Tools posted double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the quarter, propelled by strength in its flagship products Microsoft
SQL Server, Exchange Server and Windows
Server. SQL Server showed particular strength, posting greater than 15% revenue growth over the comparable
quarter in the previous year. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue was up more than 50% due to continued adoption of Windows Mobile
software. Major product announcements from both Motorola Inc. and Palm Inc. highlighted the continued customer momentum of Windows Mobile 5.0.
 
"We are encouraged that customers continue to see the tremendous value in our Windows Server System products," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We will continue to invest in programs that further improve customer satisfaction and create value for our customers. Examples of these investments are our recently announced enhancements to our Software Assurance program."
 
"We've had a good start to an important year for the company," Liddell said. "We continue to see healthy demand for our products, and customer excitement is high for our next wave of product innovations kicking off next month with the launches of Xbox 360, SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio
2005."

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $11.84 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, a 9% increase over the same period of the prior year, marking the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history. Net income for the quarter was $3.65 billion, which grew 5% from $3.46 billion for the same quarter of the previous year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.34. Net results included $108 million, or $0.01 per share, in tax benefits.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 26, 2006 
 
Operating income for the quarter was $4.66 billion, a 2% decline from the same period in the prior year reflecting in part the impact of significant sales, marketing and product development expenses associated with major product launches.
 
"The growth in our core businesses was healthy during the quarter driven by strength in Server and Tools and the success of our Windows
Client products in a robust PC market," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer of Microsoft. "The quarter also marked the beginning of an important product cycle for Microsoft with the launches of Xbox 360, SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio
2005 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0, all of which were extremely successful and well received by our customers."
 
Server and Tools revenue grew 14% over the prior year on strength across the product line. The growth of SQL Server was robust with over 20% year over year revenue growth.
 
"Demand for our desktop and server products from enterprise customers was particularly strong this quarter with significant sales and customer momentum from our recently launched server products," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We recently conducted our annual customer satisfaction survey and remain committed to driving satisfaction
improvements. Our customers are responding very favorably to the value, quality, and improved security of our new product releases."
 
During the quarter, Microsoft returned over $8.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced third-quarter revenue of $10.90 billion for the period ended March 31, 2006, a 13% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was $3.89 billion, or a 17% increase compared with $3.33 billion in the prior-year period. Operating income for the third quarter included $397 million, compared with $768 million in the prior-year period, for certain legal charges. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.98 billion and $0.29 per share, which included $0.03 of legal charges. For the same quarter of the previous year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $2.56 billion and $0.23, which included $0.05 per share of legal charges.
REDMOND, Wash.  April 27, 2006 
"We are pleased with the increasing pace of revenue growth throughout this fiscal year fueled by strong demand for our new consumer and business offerings," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer of Microsoft. "We are now accelerating our investments in the business to drive future growth, which is reflected in our financial guidance. We believe next fiscal year will deliver even stronger double-digit revenue growth than this year. Given our confidence in the future, we have also continued our momentum on buyback execution, acquiring $4.9 billion of our stock during the quarter."
Demand for Microsoft's recently released products for business and consumer customers drove robust performance during the quarter in the Home and Entertainment, Microsoft Business Solutions and Server and Tools groups. Home and Entertainment revenue was up more than 80% due to strong demand for the Xbox 360 system; Microsoft Business Solutions delivered 21% revenue growth due to continued customer interest in the
 
Microsoft Dynamics line of business management solutions. This quarter marked the fifteenth consecutive quarter of double digit revenue growth for Server and Tools. "The Windows Server platform value proposition is truly resonating with customers, as shown by growth in Microsoft
SQL Server revenue of over 30% this quarter," said Kevin Johnson, co-president, Platforms & Services Division. "Enterprise customers are increasingly selecting SQL Server to run their mission-critical applications because of its high performance, security and business intelligence capabilities."

On June 15, 2006, Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") issued a press release to announce that effective July 2008, Bill Gates, Microsoft's Chairman and Chief Software Architect, will transition out of a day-to-day role at the company. As further described in the attached press release, after a two-year transition process to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of Mr. Gates' daily responsibilities, Mr. Gates will continue to serve as Chairman and an advisor on key development projects beyond 2008.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
For Release 1:30 p.m. PDT
June 15, 2006
Microsoft Corp. today announced that effective July 2008 Bill Gates, chairman, will transition out of a day-to-day role in the company to spend more time on his global health and education work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The company announced a two-year transition process to ensure that there is a smooth and orderly transfer of Gates' daily responsibilities, and said that after July 2008 Gates would continue to serve as the company's chairman and an advisor on key development projects.
REDMOND, Wash.  June 15, 2006 
The company announced that Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie will immediately assume the title of chief software architect and begin working side by side with Gates on all technical architecture and product oversight responsibilities, to ensure a smooth transition. Similarly, Chief Technical Officer Craig Mundie will immediately take the new title of chief research and strategy officer and will work closely with Gates to assume his responsibility for the company's research and incubation efforts; Mundie also will partner with general counsel Brad Smith to guide Microsoft's intellectual property and technology policy efforts.
"Our business and technical leadership has never been stronger, and Microsoft is well-positioned for success in the years ahead. I feel very fortunate to have such great technical leaders like Ray and Craig at the company," Gates said. "I remain fully committed and full time
 
 
at Microsoft through June 2008 and will be working side by side with Ray and Craig to ensure that a smooth transition occurs."
"This was a hard decision for me," Gates added. "I'm very lucky to have two passions that I feel are so important and so challenging. As I prepare for this change, I firmly believe the road ahead for Microsoft is as bright as ever."
In September 2005 Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer organized the company into three divisions under presidents Jim Allchin, Kevin Johnson, Robbie Bach and Jeff Raikes, who were given much greater responsibility for product development and strategy decisions within their respective businesses. In August 2005 the company appointed Kevin Turner as chief operating officer.
"Bill and I are confident we've got a great team that can step up to fill his shoes and drive Microsoft innovation forward without missing a beat," Ballmer said. "We will continue to hire the world's best technical talent and give them the tools to do their best work, and we will continue to tackle the biggest challenges and opportunities for our customers by investing for the long term."
Ballmer and Gates noted that Microsoft has been steadily expanding its senior leadership in recent years, and that today's announcement continues a transition process that has been underway for several years. In January 2000, Gates assumed the role of chief software architect and Ballmer assumed the role of CEO, responsible for all day-to-day operations and company business strategy.
"This is a very sensible and thorough approach. A two-year transition will ensure that the company has a smooth transfer of strategy and knowledge from Bill to the next generation of leaders," said James I. Cash, Ph.D., member of the Microsoft board of directors and former
 
 
James E. Robison Professor, Harvard Business School. "Steve and his management team are very impressive, and I'm confident the company will not miss a step."
Ozzie, 50, worked on the first electronic spreadsheet, VisiCalc, in the early 1980s, then joined Lotus Development Corp. in 1983 to develop Lotus Symphony, an MS-DOS
-based integrated software management product that combined word processing, spreadsheet, business graphics, data management and communications capabilities. In 1984, Ozzie formed Iris Associates Inc. to develop Lotus Notes. In 1997 Ozzie founded Groove Networks, where he developed Groove Virtual Office. Microsoft acquired Groove Networks in April 2005 and named Ozzie chief technical officer.
Mundie, 56, joined Microsoft in 1992 to create and run the Consumer Platforms Division, which was responsible for developing non-PC platform and service offerings including the Microsoft
Windows
CE operating system; software for handheld PCs, Pocket PCs and Auto PCs; and early telephony products. Mundie also started Microsoft's digital TV efforts and acquired and managed the WebTV Networks Inc. subsidiary. Mundie is also the original champion of the Trustworthy Computing Initiative at Microsoft, which has influenced Microsoft's software development strategy. His current responsibilities also include global technology policy and a variety of technical and business incubation activities.
Ozzie and Mundie will continue to report to Gates. At an appropriate time during the two-year transition period, they will shift to reporting to Ballmer.
Gates, 50, started Microsoft in 1975 with childhood friend Paul Allen. He took Microsoft public in 1986 and was the company's chairman and CEO until 2000, when Ballmer took over as CEO. For the past six years Gates has focused on Microsoft's software development as the
 
 
company's chairman and chief software architect. In 2000, with his wife, he formed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, whose assets now are $29.1 billion.
Founded in 1975, Microsoft has pioneered many of the software innovations that paved the way for the digital information revolution and launched the PC industry. Beginning with MS-DOS, Microsoft's first operating system, and continuing with products such as Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows and Xbox, the company has developed a broad range of software, services and solutions that have transformed the way people work, communicate and play. Microsoft has 63,000 employees in more than 100 countries and generates annual sales of more than $40 billion (U.S.). With products for desktop PCs, servers and mobile devices, Microsoft continues to be the worldwide leader in helping people and businesses realize their full potential.

Powers of the Board
provided that
(c) . All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of any Options granted under the Plan.
Effect of Board's Decision
5. .
Eligibility
(a) Options may be granted only to Employees. For avoidance of doubt, directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan unless they are full-time Employees.
(b) Each Option shall be designated in the written option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the Shares with respect to
 
which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
(c) For purposes of Section 5(b), Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the fair market value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
(d) Nothing in the Plan or any Option granted hereunder shall confer upon any Optionee any right with respect to continuation of employment with the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause.
(e) The maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Option or Options may be granted to any Employee in any one taxable year of the Company shall not exceed 16,000,000 shares (the "Maximum Annual Employee Grant").
6. . The Plan shall become effective upon its adoption by the Board. No new Options may be granted under the Plan, provided that Shares subject to the Plan (other than Shares issued in the exercise of Options granted under the Plan) shall be available for grants and awards under the 2001 Plan as provided in Section 3 and awards shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 11.
Term of Plan
7. . The term of each Option shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant, provided that if the exercise of an Option or sale of the Shares received upon exercise of an Option is prevented by Company policy, then the term of the Option may be extended until (i) December 31 of the calendar year in which the ten (10) year term would otherwise expire, or (ii) thirty (30) days after the exercise of the Option or sale of the Shares received upon exercise of the Option first would be permitted by Company policy. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Optionee who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.
Term of Option
8. .
Exercise Price and Consideration
(a) The per Share exercise price under each Option shall be such price as is determined by the Board, subject to the following:
(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
(i) granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(ii) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
(2) In the case of a Nonqualified Stock Option the per Share exercise price may be less than, equal to, or greater than the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") on the date of grant. If the Shares cease to be listed on NASDAQ, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Shares.
(c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Option, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price. If the Optionee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price with Shares. If the Optionee is a participant in the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain And Bonus Deferral Program, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price of any deferred Option with Shares. Shares used by officers to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.
(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Option, the Optionee shall pay any federal, state, and local withholding obligations of the Company, if applicable. If an Optionee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may elect to pay such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Option is exercised. The right of an officer to dispose of Shares to the Company in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an option, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations.
9. .
Exercise of Option
(a) . Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when written notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person entitled to exercise the Option and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 8(c) of the
 
Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Option. In the event that the exercise of an Option is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option pursuant to Section 5(b), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 11 of the Plan.
Exercise of an Option in any manner shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(b) . In the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee, such Optionee may exercise stock options to the extent exercisable on the date of termination. Such exercise must occur within three (3) months (or such shorter time as may be specified in the grant), after the date of such termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise the Option at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Termination of Status as Employee
(c) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of termination of an Optionee's Continuous Status as an Employee as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months), the Optionee may exercise the Option, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee remained in Continuous Status as an Employee for a period of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Employee ceased working as a result of the total and permanent disability. Such exercise must occur within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the Employee ceased working as a result of the total and permanent disability (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement). To the extent that the Optionee was not entitled to exercise such Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
Disability of Optionee
(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9(b) above, in the event of the death of an Optionee:
Death of Optionee
(i) who is at the time of death an Employee of the Company, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option
 
Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that would have accrued had the Optionee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as an Employee twelve (12) months after the date of death; or
(ii) whose Option has not yet expired but whose Continuous Status as an Employee terminated prior to the date of death, the Option may be exercised, at any time within six (6) months following the date of death (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Option Agreement), by the Optionee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had accrued at the date of termination.
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) above, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that except as provided in Section 7 above no such extension shall extend the term of an option beyond the date on which the option would have expired if no termination of the Employee's Continuous Status as an Employee had occurred).
10. . The Option may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
Non-Transferability of Options
11. . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per share covered by outstanding Options under the Plan, and (iii) the Maximum Annual Employee Grant. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(iii) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 11, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment, and (iii) the possibility that some Optionees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Options, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Options will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Options. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 11, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected "without receipt of consideration." Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger
 
class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Option.
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Option will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Option shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Optionee the right to exercise an Option as to all or any part of the Optioned Shares, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each Option shall be assumed or an equivalent option shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Option or to substitute an equivalent option, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Optionee to have the right to exercise the Option as to all of the Optioned Shares, including Shares as to which the Option would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Option fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Optionee that the Option shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
12. . The date of grant of an Option shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to the grant of an option and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the exercise of an option shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Employee to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.
Time of Granting Options
13. . The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Options in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Options assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Options before and after the substitution.
Substitutions and Assumptions
14. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Company's ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that any increase in the number of Shares subject to the Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment under Section 11 of the Plan, shall require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Board shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries
Employees in Foreign Countries
 
may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Options granted to Employees employed in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
(c) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 4 and 11, any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Options already granted and such Options shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
15. . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
16. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
17. . The Plan, as amended, is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company at the 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If the Plan, as herein amended, is not so approved by the shareholders, the Plan, as previously approved, shall continue in effect.
Shareholder Approval
[The number of shares in Sections 3 and 5(e) have been increased to reflect the 2-for-1 stock splits in May 1994, November 1996, February 1998, March 1999 and February 2003. The number of shares in Section 3 has also been increased to reflect the adjustments related to the special dividend payable December 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004.]

For awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), performance goals will be based on one or more of the following business criteria: sales or licensing volume, revenues, customer satisfaction, expenses, organizational health/productivity, earnings (which includes similar measurements such as net profits, operating profits and net income, and which may be calculated before or after taxes, interest, depreciation, amortization or taxes), margins, cash flow, shareholder return, return on equity, return on assets or return on investments, working capital, product shipments or releases, brand or product recognition or acceptance and/or stock price. These criteria may be measured: individually, alternatively or in any combination; with respect to the Company, a subsidiary, division, business unit, product line, product or any combination of the foregoing; on an absolute basis, or relative to a target, to a designated comparison group, to results in other periods or to other external measures; and including or excluding items that could affect the measurement, such as extraordinary or unusual and nonrecurring gains or losses, litigation or claim judgments or settlements, material changes in tax laws, acquisitions or divestitures, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, asset write-downs, restructuring charges, or the results of discontinued operations.
 
(c) . All decisions, determinations, and interpretations of the Board shall be final and binding on all Participants and Awardees.
Effect of Board's Decision
5. .
Eligibility
(a) Awards may be granted to Participants and to persons to whom offers of employment as an Employee have been extended; provided that Incentive Stock Options may only be granted to Employees. For avoidance of doubt, directors are not eligible to participate in the Plan unless they are Employees or Consultants.
(b) The maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Award or Awards may be granted to any Participant in any one taxable year of the Company (the "Maximum Annual Participant Award") shall not exceed 20,000,000 Common Shares for Options or SARs, or 5,000,000 shares for Stock Awards (increased, in both cases proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares). If an Option is in tandem with an SAR, such that the exercise of the Option or SAR with respect to a Share cancels the tandem SAR or Option right, respectively, with respect to each Share, the tandem Option and SAR rights with respect to each Share shall be counted as covering but one Share for purposes of the Maximum Annual Participant Award.
6. .
Options
(a) Each Option shall be designated in the written or electronic option agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonqualified Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designations, to the extent that the aggregate fair market value of the Shares with respect to which Options designated as Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
(b) For purposes of Section 6(a), Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the fair market value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
(c) Options converted or substituted under the Plan for any or all outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights held by employees, consultants, advisors or other option holders granted by entities subsequently acquired by the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company ("Conversion Options") shall be effective as of the close of the respective mergers into, or acquisitions of such entities by, the Company or a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; provided that such Conversion Options may not be exercised during any periods that may be specified by the Company immediately following the close of the merger or acquisition necessary to ensure compliance with applicable law. The Conversion Options may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options, as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that stock appreciation rights in the acquired entity shall only be converted to or substituted with Nonqualified Stock Options. The Conversion Options shall be options to purchase the number of Common Shares determined by multiplying the number of shares of the acquired entity's common stock underlying each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to the closing of such merger or acquisition by the number specified in the applicable merger or acquisition agreement for conversion of each share of such entity's common stock to a Common Share (the "Merger Ratio"). Such Conversion
 
Options shall be exercisable at an exercise price per Common Share (increased to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per share of the acquired entity's common stock under each such stock option or stock appreciation right immediately prior to closing divided by the Merger Ratio. No fractional Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of Conversion Options. In lieu of such issuance, the Common Shares issued pursuant to each such exercise shall be rounded to the closest whole Share. Conversion Options may be granted and exercised without the issuance of an Award Agreement.
7. .
Stock Awards
(a) Stock Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under the Plan. After the Committee determines that it will offer a Stock Award, it will advise the Awardee in writing or electronically, by means of an Award Agreement, of the terms, conditions and restrictions, including vesting, if any, related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the Awardee shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the price to be paid, if any, and, if applicable, the time within which the Awardee must accept the offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of an Award Agreement in the manner determined by the Committee; provided that Shares may be issued to an Awardee under a fully vested Stock Award without the issuance of an Award Agreement.
(b) Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the Award Agreement shall provide for the forfeiture of the non-vested Common Shares underlying such Stock Award upon the Awardee ceasing to be a Participant. To the extent that the Awardee purchased the Shares granted under such Stock Award and any such Shares remain non-vested at the time the Awardee ceases to be a Participant, the cessation of Participant status shall cause an immediate sale of such non-vested Shares to the Company at the original price per Common Share paid by the Awardee.
8. .
SARs
(a) The Committee shall have the full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant SARs to selected Awardees. The Committee is authorized to grant both tandem stock appreciation rights ("Tandem SARs") and stand-alone stock appreciation rights ("Stand-Alone SARs") as described below.
(b) .
Tandem SARs
(i) Awardees may be granted a Tandem SAR, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying Section 6 Option for Common Shares or the surrender of the Option in exchange for a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the fair market value (on the Option surrender date) of the number of Shares in which the Awardee is at the time vested under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (B) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested Shares.
(ii) No such Option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Committee, either at the time of the actual Option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distributions to which the Awardee shall become entitled under this Section 8(b) may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the
 
Option surrender date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
(iii) If the surrender of an Option is not approved by the Committee, then the Awardee shall retain whatever rights he or she had under the surrendered Option (or surrendered portion thereof) on the Option surrender date and may exercise such rights at any time prior to the later of (A) five (5) business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (B) the last day on which the Option is otherwise exercisable in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing such Option, but in no event may such rights be exercised more than ten (10) years after the date of the Option grant.
(c) .
Stand-Alone SARs
(i) An Awardee may be granted a Stand-Alone SAR not tied to any underlying Option under Section 6 of the Plan. The Stand-Alone SAR shall cover a specified number of Common Shares and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish. Upon exercise of the Stand-Alone SAR, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Company in an amount equal to the excess of (A) the aggregate fair market value (on the exercise date) of the Common Shares underlying the exercised right over (B) the aggregate base price in effect for those Shares.
(ii) The number of Common Shares underlying each Stand-Alone SAR and the base price in effect for those Shares shall be determined by the Committee at the time the Stand-Alone SAR is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per Share be less than the fair market value per underlying Common Share on the grant date.
(iii) The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone SAR may be made in Common Shares valued at fair market value on the exercise date, in cash, or partly in Shares and partly in cash, as the Committee shall deem appropriate.
(d) The Common Shares underlying any SARs exercised under this Section 8 shall not be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.
9. . The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date. It shall continue in effect until terminated under Section 17 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
10.
Term of Award; Limitations on Vesting and Repricing.
(a) The term of each Award shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. However, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Option is granted, owns Shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Option shall be no more than five (5) years from the date of grant.
(b) Each Award shall vest over a period of not less than three (3) years from the date of grant, provided that Awards covering up to 50,000,000 shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, stock dividend or similar event) may be granted without regard to the 3-year vesting restriction; provided further, that Conversion Options and awards that are granted or vest based on performance goals or that vest in less than three (3)
 
years based on death, disability, or retirement shall not count toward the limit of this Section 10(b).
(c) No Award may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, or modified without approval of the shareholders of the Company (except in connection with an adjustment pursuant to Section 14) if the effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the Shares underlying such Award.
11. .
Exercise Price and Consideration
(a) The per Share exercise price under each Award shall be such price as is determined by the Board, subject to the following:
(i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time of the grant of such Incentive Stock Option, owns shares representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of shares of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
(B) granted to any other Employee, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant.
(ii) Except for Conversion Options under Section 6(c), the per Share exercise price under a Nonqualified Stock Option or SAR shall be no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value per Share on the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing (or any other provision of the Plan), Options and SARs that are granted to Employees who are non-exempt for purposes of the FLSA, shall satisfy the requirements for exclusion from regular rate of pay for purposes of the FLSA and shall have an exercise price that is at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the underlying Shares at the time of grant; furthermore, such Options or SARs shall not be exercisable within the six (6) month period immediately following the date of grant, except, if so provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of the Awardee's death, disability, or retirement, upon a change in corporate control of the Company, or under such other circumstances as are permitted under the FLSA or rules and regulations thereunder.
(iii) The maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under this Plan is 50,000,000 Shares (increased, proportionately, in the event of any stock split, or stock dividend or similar event with respect to the Shares); provided that Conversion Options shall not count against the limit of this Section 11(a)(iii).
(b) The fair market value per Share shall be the closing price per share of the Common Share on the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") on the date of grant. If the Shares cease to be listed on Nasdaq, the Board shall designate an alternative method of determining the fair market value of the Shares.
 
(c) The consideration to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Award, including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant and may consist of cash and/or check. Payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver to the Company the amount of sale proceeds necessary to pay the exercise price. If the Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the officer may, in addition, be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price with Shares which, as of the exercise date, the officer has owned for six (6) months or more. If the Awardee is a participant in the 1998 Microsoft Corporation Stock Option Gain And Bonus Deferral Program, he may in addition be allowed to pay all or part of the purchase price of any deferred Option with Shares. Shares used by officers to pay the exercise price shall be valued at their fair market value on the exercise date.
(d) Prior to issuance of the Shares upon exercise of an Award, the Awardee shall pay any federal, state, and local income and employment tax withholding obligations applicable to such Award. If an Awardee is an officer of the Company within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, he may elect to pay such withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld. The value of the Shares to be withheld shall equal the fair market value of the Shares on the day the Award is exercised. The right of an officer to dispose of Shares to the Company in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations shall be deemed to be approved as part of the initial grant of an Award, unless thereafter rescinded, and shall otherwise be made in compliance with Rule 16b-3 and other applicable regulations, and any Award under the Plan may permit or require that such withholding tax obligations be paid by having the Company withhold Shares having a value equal to the amount required to be withheld.
12. .
Exercise of Award
(a) . Any Award granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Board at the time of grant, and as shall be permissible under the terms of the Plan.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
An Award may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
An Award shall be deemed to be exercised when written or electronic notice of such exercise has been given to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise the Award and full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised has been received by the Company. Full payment may, as authorized by the Board, consist of any consideration and method of payment allowable under Section 11(c) of the Plan. Until the issuance (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) of the share certificate evidencing such Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Shares subject to the Award, notwithstanding the exercise of the Award. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such share certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award. In the event that the exercise of an Award is treated in part as the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and in part as the exercise of a Nonqualified
 
Stock Option pursuant to Section 6(a), the Company shall issue a share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option and a separate share certificate evidencing the Shares treated as acquired upon the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option, and shall identify each such certificate accordingly in its share transfer records. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the share certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 14 of the Plan.
Exercise of an Award in any manner and delivery of the Shares subject to such Award shall result in a decrease in the number of Shares which thereafter may be available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Award, by the number of Shares as to which the Award is exercised.
(b) . In the event of termination of an Awardee's Continuous Status as a Participant, such Awardee may exercise his or her rights under any outstanding Awards to the extent exercisable on the date of termination (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Award as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise his or her rights under such Awards at the date of such termination, or does not exercise such rights within the time specified in the individual Award Agreements, the Awards shall terminate, except as otherwise may be provided in the Award Agreement.
Termination of Status as a Participant
(c) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of termination of an Awardee's Continuous Status as a Participant as a result of total and permanent disability (i.e., the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of twelve (12) months), the Awardee will vest in the Award, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee remained in Continuous Status as a Participant for a period of twelve (12) months after the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(c) must be exercised within eighteen (18) months (or such shorter time as is specified in the grant) from the date on which the Participant ceased performing services as a result of the total and permanent disability (but in no event later than the date of expiration of the term of such Option or SAR as set forth in the Award Agreement). To the extent that the Awardee was not entitled to exercise such Option or SAR within the time specified herein, the Award shall terminate. This Section 12(c) shall only apply to a Conversion Option to the extent provided in the Award Agreement for the Conversion Option.
Disability of Awardee
(d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12(b) above, in the event of the death of an Awardee:
Death of Awardee
(i) who is at the time of death a Participant, the Award will vest, but only to the extent of the vesting that would have occurred had the Awardee continued living and remained in Continuous Status as a Participant twelve (12) months following the date of death. An Option or SAR that is vested pursuant to this Section 12(d)(i) may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Award by bequest or inheritance; or
 
(ii) whose Option or SAR has not yet expired but whose Continuous Status as a Participant terminated prior to the date of death, the Option or SAR may be exercised, at any time within twelve (12) months following the date of death, by the Awardee's estate or by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option or SAR by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent of the right to exercise that had vested at the date of termination.
This Section 12(d) shall only apply to a Conversion Option to the extent provided in the Award Agreement for the Conversion Option.
(e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this Section 12, the Board shall have the authority to extend the expiration date of any outstanding Option in circumstances in which it deems such action to be appropriate (provided that no such extension shall extend the term of an Award beyond the date on which the Award would have expired if no termination of the Employee's Continuous Status as a Participant had occurred).
13. . An Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Awardee, only by the Awardee; provided that the Board may permit further transferability, on a general or specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability.
Non-Transferability of Awards
14. . If any change is made to the Shares by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Shares as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities and/or the price per Share covered by outstanding Awards under the Plan, (iii) the Maximum Annual Participant Award, (iv) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Nonqualified Stock Options and SARs with a per Share exercise price of less than fair market value on any grant date that may be granted under the Plan, and (v) the maximum aggregate number of Shares underlying all Awards with a vesting period of less than three years. The Board may also make adjustments described in (i)-(v) of the previous sentence in the event of any distribution of assets to shareholders other than a normal cash dividend. In determining adjustments to be made under this Section 14, the Board may take into account such factors as it deems appropriate, including (i) the restrictions of applicable law, (ii) the potential tax consequences of an adjustment and (iii) the possibility that some Awardees might receive an adjustment and a distribution or other unintended benefit, and in light of such factors or circumstances may make adjustments that are not uniform or proportionate among outstanding Awards, modify vesting dates, defer the delivery of stock certificates or make other equitable adjustments. Any such adjustments to outstanding Awards will be effected in a manner that precludes the enlargement of rights and benefits under such Awards. Adjustments, if any, and any determinations or interpretations, including any determination of whether a distribution is other than a normal cash dividend, made by the Board shall be final, binding and conclusive. For purposes of this Section 14, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been effected without receipt of consideration. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of any class, or securities convertible into shares of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Plan
 
In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action, unless otherwise provided by the Board. The Board may, in the exercise of its sole discretion in such instances, declare that any Award shall terminate as of a date fixed by the Board and give each Awardee the right to exercise an Award as to all or any part of the Shares subject to an Award, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation, each Award shall be assumed or an equivalent award shall be substituted by such successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation, unless such successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or to substitute an equivalent award, in which case the Board shall, in lieu of such assumption or substitution, provide for the Awardee to have the right to exercise the Award as to all of the Shares subject to Awards, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. If the Board makes an Award fully exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Board shall notify the Awardee that the Award shall be fully exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Award will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
15. . The date of grant of an Award shall, for all purposes, be the date on which the Company completes the corporate action relating to the grant of such Award and all conditions to the grant have been satisfied, provided that conditions to the grant, exercise or vesting of an Award shall not defer the date of grant. Notice of a grant shall be given to each Participant to whom an Award is so granted within a reasonable time after the determination has been made.
Time of Granting Awards
16. . The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies, provided such substitutions and assumptions are permitted by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The number of Shares reserved pursuant to Section 3 may be increased by the corresponding number of Awards assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number of Shares subject to Awards before and after the substitution.
Substitutions and Assumptions
17. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Board may amend or terminate the Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable (including, but not limited to amendments which the Board deems appropriate to enhance the Company's ability to claim deductions related to stock option exercises); provided that any increase in the number of Shares subject to the Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment under Section 14 of the Plan, and any amendment described in Section 10(c) of the Plan, shall require approval of or ratification by the shareholders of the Company.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Board shall have the authority to adopt such modifications, procedures, and subplans as may be necessary or desirable to comply with provisions of the laws of foreign countries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries may operate to assure the viability of the benefits from Awards granted to Participants performing services in such countries and to meet the objectives of the Plan.
Participants in Foreign Countries
 
(c) . Except as otherwise provided in Sections 4 and 14, any such amendment or termination of the Plan shall not affect Awards already granted and such Awards shall remain in full force and effect as if this Plan had not been amended or terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Awardee and the Board, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Awardee and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
18. . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Shares may then be listed, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
19. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
20. . Nothing in the Plan shall confer upon any Participant the right to an Award or to continue in service as an Employee or Consultant for any period of specific duration, or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining such person), or of any Participant or Awardee, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate such person's services at any time for any reason, with or without cause.
No Employment/Service Rights
 
 

Exhibit 99.3
Microsoft Corp. today announced record fourth quarter revenue of $11.80 billion for the period ended June 30, 2006, a 16% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was $3.88 billion, a 30% increase compared with $2.99 billion in the prior year period. Operating income for the fourth quarter included certain legal charges of $351 million, compared with $756 million in the prior year period. Net income for the fourth quarter was $2.83 billion and diluted earnings per share were $0.28, which included $0.03 of certain legal charges. For the same quarter of the previous year, net income was $3.70 billion and diluted earnings per share were $0.34, which included $0.05 of certain legal charges and $0.09 of tax benefits.
REDMOND, Wash.  July 20, 2006 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the company announced revenue of $44.28 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year. Operating income for the fiscal year was $16.47 billion, or 13% over the prior year period. Operating income for the fiscal year included $1.11 billion for certain legal charges, compared with $2.06 billion in the prior year period. Net income for the fiscal year was $12.60 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, which included $0.08 of certain legal charges and $0.01 of tax benefits. For the previous fiscal year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $12.25 billion and $1.12, which included $0.13 of certain legal charges and $0.09 of tax benefits.
"We delivered a very strong finish to the fiscal year highlighted by customer demand for our recently launched products of Xbox 360, SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0, which fueled a combined 31% revenue growth of their business groups for the quarter," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer of Microsoft. "Our upcoming launches of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Exchange Server 2007, and other key products position us to continue to deliver strong revenue growth in fiscal year 2007. We are also very pleased that both the Microsoft Business Solutions and the Mobile and Embedded Devices businesses achieved profitability for the full fiscal year."
The company also announced that its board of directors has authorized new share repurchase programs, comprising a $20 billion tender offer scheduled to be completed on August 17, 2006, as well as authorization for up to an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Furthermore, the company also announced today that it completed its previously announced $30 billion stock repurchase program.
"With our share repurchase programs announcement today, we reaffirm our confidence and optimism in the long term future of the company and continue to execute on our strategy of returning capital to shareholders," said Liddell.
Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by broad-based strength in both business and consumer customer segments. Server and Tools delivered 18% revenue growth for the quarter, fueled by an increase of over 35% revenue growth for SQL Server. Healthy Client revenue was driven by continued growth in the PC market as well as improvements in its commercial and retail licensing results. The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 product continues to show robust customer acceptance, adding more than fifty thousand seats during the quarter, while licenses for Windows Mobile-based phones grew by 90% in fiscal year 2006.
"The results for this fiscal year highlight the value and even greater satisfaction our customers are experiencing with our new products as we kicked off our multi-year product cycle," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We are also seeing fantastic momentum in multi-year licensing growth as customer excitement for upcoming product releases drove higher than expected annuity sales and unearned revenue growth."
Microsoft returned over $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and returned over $23 billion to shareholders this fiscal year.
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending September 30, 2006:
 
 
 
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2007:
 
 
 
Under the terms of the tender offer, the company will repurchase up to $20 billion of its common stock at a price per share not greater than $24.75 and not less than $22.50. This represents the repurchase of up to 808,080,808 shares of common stock, or about 8.1% of the common shares outstanding. The tender offer is expected to commence on July 21, 2006 and to expire, unless extended, at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on August 17, 2006. A modified "Dutch auction" will allow shareholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the company's specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders, the company will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable it to purchase up to 808,080,808 company shares, or such lesser number of shares as are properly tendered. The company will not purchase shares below a price stipulated by a shareholder, and in some cases, may actually purchase shares at prices above a shareholder's indication under the terms of the modified "Dutch auction." Specific instructions and a complete explanation of the terms and conditions of the tender offer are contained in the Offer to Purchase and related materials that will be mailed to shareholders of record beginning on July 24, 2006.
Microsoft's directors and executive officers have advised Microsoft that they do not intend to tender any of their shares in the tender offer.
Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank will serve as co-dealer managers for the tender offer. Georgeson Inc. will serve as information agent and Mellon Investor Services will serve as the depositary.
This press release is for informational purpose only and is not an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of the company's common stock.

Summary
 
Fourth Quarter
Our revenue growth for the three months ended June 30, 2006 was driven primarily by an increase in Xbox 360 revenue, increased licensing of SQL Server, Windows Server, and other server applications, growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through original equipment manufacturers ("OEM"), and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. Continued PC and server shipment growth also contributed to our overall revenue growth. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 11% to 12% driven by strong business demand in both emerging and mature markets. Included in the fourth quarter was an increase to revenue of $180 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with OEM distributors in our system builder channel with both industry practices and other Microsoft channels. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the quarter.
For the three months ended June 30, 2006, operating income increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $379 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by a $742 million increase in cost of revenue primarily as a result of Xbox 360 console sales and a $197 million increase in research and development as a result of our continued efforts to support MSN's development of adCenter and its Live Services strategy, and continuing research and development efforts in our Home and Entertainment segment. Headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $260 million or 11% resulting from both a 16% growth in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. Stock-based compensation expense decreased $172 million or 32% reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Our revenue growth for fiscal year 2006 was driven primarily by growth in SQL Server following the launch of SQL Server 2005 in the second quarter, Windows Server and other server applications, increased Xbox revenue resulting from the Xbox 360 launch in the second quarter, growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 11% to 13% during fiscal year 2006. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated or operating segment revenue during the fiscal year.
Operating income for fiscal year 2006 increased primarily reflecting the revenue increase and a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. These changes were partially offset by a $1.62 billion increase in cost of revenue related to Xbox 360 and a $1.26 billion increase in sales and marketing expense primarily as a result of increased investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. Headcount-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, increased $682 million or 7% resulting from both an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount and a 16% growth in headcount over the past twelve months. Stock-based compensation expense decreased $733 million or 30% reflecting a continuing decline in stock option amortization expense.
Our seven segments are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. On July 17, 2006 we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the culmination of our realignment announced in September 2005. These changes will be effective for fiscal year 2007; the seven segments discussed in this analysis are presented the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal year 2006.
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Fiscal year 2005 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation.
Client
 
Client consists of premium edition operating systems, including Windows XP Professional, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems, including Windows XP Home. Premium offerings are Windows operating systems sold at a premium above Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue.
Fourth Quarter
Client revenue increased reflecting $330 million or 13% growth in OEM revenue driven by 19% growth in OEM licenses and $32 million or 6% growth in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. OEM revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $89 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with OEM distributors in our system builder channel with both industry standards and other Microsoft channels. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed ("OEM Premium Mix") during the quarter increased two percentage points to 55% of total OEM Windows operating systems. The quarterly differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the quarter, changes in the geographical mix, and the channel mix of products sold by large, multinational OEMs versus those sold by OEM distributors in the system builder channel.
Client operating income increased primarily reflecting the increase in OEM revenue partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs. Headcount-related costs increased 9% in the three months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Client revenue increased reflecting $1.18 billion or 12% growth in OEM revenue driven by 17% growth in OEM license units from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $118 million or 6% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. During the year, the OEM Premium Mix increased two percentage points to 52%.
Client operating income increased reflecting the increase in OEM revenue partially offset by a $224 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, excluding headcount-related costs, mainly driven by increased investments in partner marketing and Windows Vista pre-launch programs. Headcount-related costs increased 6% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 13% increase in headcount primarily associated with Windows Vista and further investments in our sales and marketing organization, and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses ("CAL") for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Exchange Server and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products.
Fourth Quarter
Server and Tools revenue increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 mainly driven by growth in SQL Server following the launch of SQL Server 2005 in the second quarter and continued strength in Windows Server licensing. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $436 million or 19%. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server System products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 35% for the quarter. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $52 million or 13% primarily due to higher demand for services.
Server and Tools operating income increased reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs primarily as a result of increased headcount-related costs. Total Server and Tools headcount-related costs increased 5% related to both an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Server and Tools revenue increased during fiscal year 2006 mainly driven by growth in SQL Server, Windows Server, and Core CAL. SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005 were launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 and produced revenue growth in these product lines. Revenue is impacted by overall server hardware shipments which we estimate grew 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.31 billion or 16% during fiscal year 2006. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server System products, especially SQL Server, which grew over 30% for the year. Consulting, Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $218 million or 15% primarily due to higher demand for services.
Server and Tools operating income increased during fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses. Excluding headcount-related costs, sales and marketing expenses increased $274 million due to additional spending to support long term strategies and marketing expenses primarily related to the launch of SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Total Server and Tools headcount-related costs increased 5% related to both an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Information Worker
 
Information Worker primarily consists of the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers, solutions, and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CAL, and other information worker products including Office Communications Server and OneNote. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence.
Fourth Quarter
Information Worker revenue increased during the three months ended June 30, 2006 primarily reflecting a $144 million or 6% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, while OEM revenue increased $45 million or 11%. OEM revenue growth included an increase to revenue of $60 million resulting from the alignment of our billings associated with OEM distributors in our system builder channel with both industry practice and other Microsoft channels.
Information Worker operating income increased reflecting the revenue growth, partially offset by a $30 million or 5% increase in sales and marketing expenses as a result of continued investment in field-dedicated headcount in additional geographic markets and a $23 million or 12% increase in research and development expenses related to Office Communications Server, Office Live and Microsoft Office 2007. Headcount-related costs increased 14% during the quarter reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Information Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2006 primarily reflecting a $521 million or 5% increase in volume licensing, retail packaged products, and preinstalled versions of Office in Japan, while OEM revenue increased $66 million or 4%.
Information Worker operating income growth for the fiscal year was primarily due to the revenue growth, partially offset by a $283 million or 15% increase in sales and marketing expenses related to supporting field sales efforts and a $71 million or 10% increase in research and development expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 14% during fiscal year 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount related to supporting field sales efforts and research and development investments in future products and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Microsoft Business Solutions
 
Microsoft Business Solutions provides business management software solutions targeted to businesses of varying sizes. The main products consist of enterprise resource planning ("ERP") solutions, customer relationship management ("CRM") software, retail solutions, Microsoft Partner Program, and related services. Microsoft Business Solutions also includes the Small and Mid-market Solutions & Partners ("SMS&P") organization, which focuses on sales to customers and partners in the small and mid-market customer segments. Revenue is derived from software and services sales, with software sales representing a significant amount of total revenue. Software revenues include both new software licenses and enhancement plans, which provide customers with future software upgrades over the period of the plan. Our solutions are delivered through a worldwide network of channel partners that provide services and local support.
Fourth Quarter
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased as a result of a $23 million or 15% growth in license revenue and a $13 million or 20% growth in enhancement plan revenue. License revenue growth was primarily driven by new users for Microsoft CRM and existing Dynamics ERP customers purchasing expanded functionality and additional user licenses. Enhancement plan revenue growth resulted primarily from renewals of Dynamics ERP products.
Microsoft Business Solutions operating income increased as a result of the revenue growth and a $78 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a result of decreased net SMS&P spending. Headcount-related costs increased 4% reflecting both a 10% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Microsoft Business Solutions revenue increased as a result of an $85 million or 18% growth in license revenue and a $46 million or 18% growth in enhancement plan revenue. License revenue growth was driven by new users for Microsoft CRM and existing Dynamics ERP customers purchasing expanded functionality and additional user licenses. Enhancement plan revenue growth resulted primarily from Dynamics ERP products.
Microsoft Business Solutions operating income increased reflecting the increase in revenue accompanied by a $56 million decrease in sales and marketing expense as a result of decreased net SMS&P spending. Headcount-related costs increased 3% reflecting both a 10% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
MSN
 
MSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. In fiscal year 2006, we launched MSN adCenter  our internally developed advertising platform  in certain international markets and throughout the U.S. where it now serves 100 percent of paid search traffic on our online properties. We believe MSN adCenter will enable us to increase both display and search advertising revenues by reducing our reliance on third parties for delivering ads. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization. In November 2005, Microsoft announced Windows Live, which is a set of Internet services and software designed to bring together user relationships, information, and interests, with enhanced safety and security across PCs, devices, and the Web. In May 2006, Microsoft announced the third release of Windows Live Local, our online local search and mapping service that gives people the ability to quickly find maps, directions and local search information. In June 2006, we released Windows Live Messenger to consumers in 58 countries.
Fourth Quarter
MSN revenue decreased primarily reflecting a $16 million or 13% decline in access revenue as subscribers continue to migrate to broadband or other competitively priced service providers, and a $5 million or 8% decrease in revenue from subscriptions and transaction services other than access. MSN advertising revenue remained flat due to an increase in display revenue offset by a reduction in search revenue resulting from the ramp up of adCenter.
MSN operating income decreased due to a $105 million or 64% increase in research and development costs, a $101 million or 67% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $52 million or 29% increase in cost of revenue as we continue to invest in MSN adCenter, Windows Live and other new platforms. Headcount-related costs increased 44% in the fourth quarter reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.
Full Fiscal Year
MSN revenue decreased primarily reflecting a $195 million or 28% in decline in access revenue, partially offset by a $126 million or 9% increase in advertising revenue and a $23 million or 9% increase in revenue from subscription and
transaction services other than access. As of June 30, 2006, MSN had 2.1 million access subscribers compared with 2.7 million at June 30, 2005. In addition, MSN had over 261 million active Hotmail accounts and over 243 million active Messenger accounts as of June 30, 2006. The increase in advertising revenue reflects growth in display advertising for portals, channels, email, and messaging services, which was partially offset by a decline in search revenue due to the ramp up of adCenter.
MSN operating income decreased due to a $230 million or 39% increase in research and development costs, a $126 million or 22% increase in sales and marketing expenses, and a $67 million or 9% increase in cost of revenue as we continue to invest in MSN adCenter, Windows Live and other new platforms. Headcount-related costs increased 25% reflecting a 44% increase in headcount and increased salaries and benefits for existing employees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.
Mobile and Embedded Devices
 
Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded operating systems, and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators) and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product life cycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint previously reported in Mobile and Embedded Devices were moved to MSN. Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN operating results for the prior periods have been restated for this reorganization.
Fourth Quarter
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth was primarily due to strength in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems sales. Revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $16 million or 37% driven by increased shipments of phone-enabled devices, partially offset by a decline in shipments for stand-alone PDAs. Revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $12 million or 38% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005.
Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss decreased as a result of the revenue growth which was partially offset by a $17 million or 31% increase in both research and development expenses and cost of revenue. Headcount-related costs increased 22% during the quarter reflecting both a 24% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for phone-enabled devices, partially offset by a decline in shipments for stand-alone PDAs. In fiscal year 2006, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $55 million or 37% while revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $49 million or 47%.
Mobile and Embedded Devices generated operating income for fiscal year 2006 as opposed to the operating loss in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to increased revenue, partially offset by a $42 million or 21% increase in both research and development and general and administrative expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 15% reflecting both a 24% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Home and Entertainment
 
Home and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division, and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online services, and the market share of the console. Our Xbox business is transitioning to a new console, the Xbox 360, which launched in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. We believe that the functionality of our new console, games portfolio, and online services are well-positioned relative to forthcoming competitive consoles. We also believe launching in advance of competitive consoles will provide a strategic advantage for the long-term success of Xbox 360. Revenue from the first generation of Xbox products has declined and is expected to continue to decline as a result of the introduction of Xbox 360.
Fourth Quarter
Home and Entertainment revenue increased primarily reflecting an increase in Xbox revenue of $503 million or 129%. Xbox revenue increased mainly due to the shipment of 1.8 million Xbox 360 consoles, which exceeded the number of first generation consoles sold in the same period of the prior year. In addition, Xbox 360 consoles sell at a higher average price than first generation consoles. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the availability of Xbox 360 consoles was no longer limited by supply constraints. Growth in revenue of $48 million or 24% from our Home Products Division, TV platform products, and PC games sales also contributed to the total Home and Entertainment revenue growth.
Home and Entertainment operating loss increased primarily as a result of a $682 million increase in cost of revenue primarily associated with the Xbox 360, partially offset by the revenue growth. Our business model anticipates that while we currently sell Xbox 360 consoles at a negative margin, product cost reductions and the future margins on sales of games and other products will enable us to achieve a positive margin over the Xbox 360 console lifecycle. The first generation Xbox consoles continue to have negative margins. Headcount-related costs increased 11% reflecting both a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Home and Entertainment revenue increased primarily due to the launch of the Xbox 360 console partially offset by a decline in first party Xbox game sales primarily resulting from the significant impact of Halo2 in fiscal year 2005. We sold approximately 5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fiscal year. The revenue growth was also attributed to $140 million or 15% growth from our other product lines, primarily as a result of an increase in PC games sales due to significant new game releases, especially "Age of Empires III", and an increase in MSTV revenue due to deployments in fiscal year 2006.
Home and Entertainment operating loss increased primarily as a result of a $1.64 billion increase in cost of revenue primarily as a result of the number of Xbox 360 consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs, partially offset by the revenue growth. Our fiscal year 2006 operating loss increase was also attributable to the significant impact of Halo2 in fiscal year 2005. Headcount-related costs increased 5% reflecting both a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Corporate-Level Activity
 
Certain corporate-level expenses are not allocated to our segments. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies.
Fourth Quarter
Corporate-level expenses decreased primarily reflecting a $379 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. During the quarter, we incurred $408 million in legal charges primarily as a result of the 281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission in July 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft. We incurred $787 million in legal charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 primarily related to antitrust and competition law claims, including $626 million for a settlement with IBM. Headcount-related costs increased 9% reflecting both a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.
Full Fiscal Year
Corporate-level expenses decreased primarily reflecting a $991 million decrease in costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies partially offset by an $84 million increase in headcount-related costs. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 including settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, and the European Commission fine of 281 million ($351 million), as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during the prior year primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc., Gateway, IBM, and other antitrust and competition law matters. Headcount-related costs increased 5% during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 23% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation.
Cost of Revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue increased mainly due to a $682 million and a $1.64 billion increase, respectively, in Home and Entertainment in the fourth quarter and the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 as a result of an increase in the number of total Xbox consoles sold and higher Xbox 360 unit costs. The remaining increase in cost of revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2006 was due to an increase in costs associated with MSN's Internet data centers.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2006 primarily due to increased product development costs associated with new and
upcoming offerings such as MSN adCenter, Microsoft Office 2007, Windows Vista, Xbox 360, and corporate research activities. Headcount-related costs increased 8% and 3%, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 17% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2006 primarily due to increased headcount-related costs, investments in partner marketing and product launch-related spending. Headcount-related costs increased 14% and 13%, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both a 20% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
General and Administrative
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. Legal charges decreased $379 million and $991 million, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2006. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, we incurred $408 million in legal charges primarily as a result of the 281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission in July 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft. We incurred $787 million in legal charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 primarily related to antitrust and competition law claims, including $626 million for a settlement with IBM. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 including settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, and the European Commission fine, as compared to $2.31 billion in legal charges incurred during the prior year primarily related to settlements with Novell, Inc., Gateway, IBM, and other antitrust and competition law matters. Headcount-related costs increased 9% and 7%, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2006 reflecting both an 18% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Investment Income and Income Taxes
Investment Income
Fourth Quarter
The components of investment income and other are as follows:
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of stock repurchases.
For the three months ended June 30, 2006, net recognized gains/(losses) on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments, net losses on sales of fixed income investments and other-than-temporary impairments on both equity and fixed income investments. Net recognized losses increased for the three months ended June 30, 2006 primarily due to higher impairments and net losses on sales of fixed income investments in the current period and lower net gains on sales of equity investments as compared to the prior period. For the three months ended June 30, 2006, other-than-temporary impairments were $317 million as compared to $20 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net gains on derivatives are as follows:
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2006, we experienced lower net gains on derivatives as compared to the comparable period in the prior year primarily reflecting net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and net losses on interest rate derivative contracts. These losses were partially offset by net gains on commodity positions in the current period driven by increases in the related commodity indices.
The net gains on equity derivatives for the three months ended June 30, 2006 are primarily due to changes in time value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges. Gains and losses arising from non-designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income.
Income from equity investees and others includes a $147 million gain related to NBC Universal, Inc.'s ("NBC") decision to exercise its option to buy our remaining 18% interest in MSNBC Cable L.L.C. ("CJV"). In the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, Microsoft and NBC entered into an agreement that restructured their joint venture relationships for CJV and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C. ("IJV"). As a result, Microsoft divested 32% of CJV for $331 million and NBC acquired the right, exercisable in the following two years, to buy the remaining 18% interest. In addition, Microsoft and NBC modified their agreements to grant to IJV a U.S. content license and to remove the exclusivity obligation on both NBC and Microsoft for local and non-U.S. news content. As part of the MSNBC restructuring agreements, Microsoft paid a fee of $200 million to effectively terminate IJV's prior content license agreement and Microsoft prepaid the remaining $14 million license fee to NBC. Microsoft's sale of its 32% investment in CJV resulted in a recognized gain of $248 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. Microsoft also recognized a loss as a result of the effective termination of IJV's license agreement of $200 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2006.
Full Fiscal Year
 
For fiscal year 2006, dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments, partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments as a result of the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004 and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year 2006.
For fiscal year 2006, net recognized gains on investments were comprised of net gains on sales of equity investments, net losses on sales of fixed income investments and other-than-temporary impairments on both equity and fixed income investments. Net recognized gains decreased in fiscal year 2006 primarily due to increased losses on sales of fixed income investments, higher other-than-temporary impairments and fewer net gains on equity investments in the current period as compared to fiscal year 2005. For fiscal year 2006, other-than-temporary impairments were $408 million, as compared to $152 million in fiscal year 2005. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net losses on derivatives are as follows:
 
During fiscal year 2006, we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year 2005 primarily due to net gains on non-designated equity derivatives in the current fiscal year as compared to net losses in the prior fiscal year and higher net gains on commodity positions in the current fiscal year driven by increases in the related commodity indices.
This was partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts.
The net gains on equity derivatives during fiscal year 2006 are primarily due to changes in the market value of non-designated equity derivatives. Gains and losses arising from non-designated derivatives are economically offset by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying equity securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts relate primarily to changes in time value of options used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. Additionally, net gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts include the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges. These gains and losses are partially offset economically by unrealized losses and gains, respectively, in the underlying assets which are included in other comprehensive income.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 was 34% and for full fiscal year 2006 was 31%. The increased rate for the fourth quarter resulted primarily from the European Commission fine of 281 million ($351 million) which is not tax deductible. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 was 4% and for full fiscal year 2005 was 26%. The decreased rate for the fourth quarter and full year resulted primarily from the reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an Internal Revenue Service examination for fiscal year 1997  1999 and a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
Financial Condition
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $34.16 billion and $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Equity and other investments were $9.23 billion and $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $18.90 billion at June 30, 2006. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, and advertising and subscription services for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006 increased $2.00 billion from March 31, 2006, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $1.92 billion, a $44 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $127 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006 increased $1.74 billion from June 30, 2005, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $1.66 billion, a $53 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $127 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of $10.9 billion of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2006:
 
Cash Flows
Our cash and short-term investments balance of $34.16 billion remained relatively flat from March 31, 2006 and decreased $3.59 billion from June 30, 2005 primarily due to increased stock repurchases. For the three months ended June 30, 2006, cash flows from operations of $3.28 billion and cash flows from investing of $3.74 billion were partially offset by common stock repurchases of $3.98 billion and cash paid for dividends of $0.92 billion. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2006, cash flows from operations of $14.40 billion and cash flows from investing of $8.00 billion were partially offset by financing activities, including common stock repurchases of $19.21 billion, cash paid for dividends of $3.55 billion, and common stock issued of $2.10 billion.
Changes to Financial Reporting Structure
On July 17, 2006, we issued a press release announcing that effective the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, we will report our businesses under five operating segments, reflecting completion of the previously announced changes in our organizational structure and how we will manage our business beginning in fiscal year 2007.

REDMOND, Wash.  July 20, 2006 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006, the company announced revenue of $44.28 billion, an 11% increase over the prior year. Operating income for the fiscal year was $16.47 billion, or 13% over the prior year period. Operating income for the fiscal year included $1.11 billion for certain legal charges, compared with $2.06 billion in the prior year period. Net income for the fiscal year was $12.60 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, which included $0.08 of certain legal charges and $0.01 of tax benefits. For the previous fiscal year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $12.25 billion and $1.12, which included $0.13 of certain legal charges and $0.09 of tax benefits.
"We delivered a very strong finish to the fiscal year highlighted by customer demand for our recently launched products of Xbox 360, SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0, which fueled a combined 31% revenue growth of their business groups for the quarter," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer of Microsoft. "Our upcoming launches of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Exchange Server 2007, and other key products position us to continue to deliver strong revenue growth in fiscal year 2007. We are also very pleased that both the Microsoft Business Solutions and the Mobile and Embedded Devices businesses achieved profitability for the full fiscal year."
The company also announced that its board of directors has authorized new share repurchase programs, comprising a $20 billion tender offer scheduled to be completed on August 17, 2006, as well as authorization for up to an additional $20 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Furthermore, the company also announced today that it completed its previously announced $30 billion stock repurchase program.
"With our share repurchase programs announcement today, we reaffirm our confidence and optimism in the long term future of the company and continue to execute on our strategy of returning capital to shareholders," said Liddell.
Revenue and operating income growth for the quarter were driven by broad-based strength in both business and consumer customer segments. Server and Tools delivered 18% revenue growth for the quarter, fueled by an increase of over 35% revenue growth for SQL Server. Healthy Client revenue was driven by continued growth in the PC market
as well as improvements in its commercial and retail licensing results. The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0 product continues to show robust customer acceptance, adding more than fifty thousand seats during the quarter, while licenses for Windows Mobile-based phones grew by 90% in fiscal year 2006.
"The results for this fiscal year highlight the value and even greater satisfaction our customers are experiencing with our new products as we kicked off our multi-year product cycle," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We are also seeing fantastic momentum in multi-year licensing growth as customer excitement for upcoming product releases drove higher than expected annuity sales and unearned revenue growth."
Microsoft returned over $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter, and returned over $23 billion to shareholders this fiscal year.
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending September 30, 2006:

A:
 
 
 
4. Why did Microsoft decide to spend our cash reserves with the repurchase programs announced today?
The Board of Directors and management believe that the repurchase programs announced today are appropriate given our confidence in the long-term potential of the Company, our future ability to generate significant cash, and our Board's assessment of our current capital requirements which include ongoing business and legal risks and investments in future growth opportunities.
A:
5. What is the impact of this decision on the future growth of the Company?
The Company is in the unique position of being able to use a significant amount of cash for the tender offer and repurchase plan we have announced AND continue to maintain sufficient cash and short term investments to fund growth opportunities. We're confident in the long-term
A:
potential of the Company and our ability to generate solid and continued earnings and cash flow growth into the future.
6. When do these changes go into effect?
The tender offer is expected to commence on July 21, 2006 and end on August 17, 2006, unless extended. The stock repurchase program will commence after the the tender offer is completed and has an expiration of June 30, 2011. The timing, volume and price of purchase under the ongoing program will be determined by management.
A:
7. What are the terms of the tender offer?
Under the terms of the tender offer, the Company will repurchase up to $20 billion of its common stock at a price per share not less than $22.50 and not greater than $24.75. Assuming a purchase price as the high-end of the range, this represents the repurchase of 808,080,808 shares of common stock, or approximately 8.1% of the common shares outstanding.
A:
The tender offer is expected to commence on July 21, 2006 and to expire at 12:00 midnight Eastern time on August 17, 2006, unless extended.
A modified "Dutch auction" will allow shareholders to indicate how many shares and at what price within the Company's specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders, the Company will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable it to purchase up to 808,080,808 shares of the Company's common stock, or such lesser number of shares as are properly tendered.
The Company will not purchase shares below a price stipulated by a shareholder, and in some cases, may actually purchase shares at prices above a shareholder's indication under the terms of the modified "Dutch auction."
8. Can employees participate in the tender offer?
Most of our employees are also shareholders and can participate in the tender offer, except for our executive officers who have said that they do not intend to participate in the tender offer. Management and the Board of Directors have made no recommendation to shareholders, including employees, as to whether they should participate in the tender offer.
A.
9: How can I participate?
All shareholders will be mailed information beginning on Monday, July 24, 2006. Information also can be obtained by contacting Georgeson Inc. at 1-866-482-5026 (U.S. only) or + 44 (0) 207 019 7137 (international). If you hold your stock in a brokerage account you may contact your broker. Participants in the Company's 401K will receive a communication directly from Fidelity Investments.
A:
10. Does this affect all worldwide employees?
The tender offer is open to all shareholders of the Company, and any employee who holds shares may elect to participate in the tender offer if her or she so chooses. The tender offer documentation and instructions on how to participate will be mailed to all shareholders during the week of July 24, 2006. For additional information, contact Georgeson Inc. at 1-866-482-5026 (U.S. only) or
A:
+ 44 (0) 207 019 7137 (international).
11. Is there a recommendation on whether employees should tender their shares?
Management and the board of directors have made no recommendation to the Company's shareholders, including employees, as to whether they should participate in the tender offer. Each shareholder should review the tender offer documentation and consult with his or her own financial and tax advisors to determine whether to participate in the tender offer.
A:
12. What are the tax implications of a stock repurchase?
The tax consequences of the tender offer are complex and will differ depending upon each shareholder's particular circumstances. We strongly encourage each shareholder to read the offer document and seek tax advice before deciding whether to participate in the tender offer. Generally, U.S. shareholders whose shares are repurchased by the Company will either recognize (1) capital gain or capital loss from the sale of such shares or (2) dividend income to the extent of the gross proceeds received for such shares. Non-U.S. shareholders will generally be subject to 30% withholding tax on their gross proceeds from the repurchase.
A.
13. How does this decision impact employees?
A: Employees who are shareholders of the Company receive the same benefits as all other shareholders of the Company.
14: Why didn't some of this money get allocated to employee compensation and benefits?
A: Due to the broad participation in equity programs most Microsoft employees are shareholders and all employees holding shares are able to participate in the tender offer.
Microsoft makes decisions annually regarding compensation and benefits budgets to ensure our compensation and benefits programs are competitive in external markets where we have employees.
15. Does this impact employee Stock Awards?
The tender offer applies to issued shares of Microsoft common stock, therefore unvested Stock Awards may not be tendered and are not affected. Shares issued as the result of vesting of employee Stock Awards and held by an employee are eligible to participate in the tender offer. The process for tendering shares is contained in the tender offer documentation and instructions.
A.
16. How does a Microsoft employee who currently holds Microsoft stock options participate in the tender offer?
The tender offer only applies to issued shares of Microsoft common stock, therefore stock options may not be tendered. However, an employee who currently holds vested options may exercise those options in accordance with the terms of the Microsoft Stock Plans and tender any of the shares issued upon exercise. The process for tendering shares is contained in the tender offer documentation and instructions.
A Microsoft employee should note that an exercise of a stock option may not be revoked even if (i) the shares acquired are tendered and not purchased in the tender offer or (ii) the Microsoft employee elects to revoke his or her tender of shares. An employee who currently holds unvested options may not exercise those options until they vest and thus cannot tender the shares in the tender offer.
17. Does this impact employees that hold Microsoft stock through the ESPP program?
Yes, employees who hold shares that they purchased shares through the ESPP may elect to tender some or all of those shares. The process for tendering shares is contained in the tender offer documentation and instructions.

On October 24, 2006, Microsoft Corporation ("the Company") issued a press release announcing programs to provide buyers of Windows Vista Capable personal computers during the holiday season with low-cost upgrades to the upcoming Windows Vista and 2007 Microsoft Office releases. A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced programs to provide holiday shoppers with low-cost upgrades to Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft
REDMOND, Wash.  Oct. 24, 2006 
Office release with the purchase of a new Windows Vista Capable personal computer. Microsoft is working with participating computer manufacturers and system builders that plan to sell PCs loaded with Windows
XP or pre-installed with 2003 Microsoft Office software to make the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Microsoft Office Technology Guarantee programs available to consumers and small businesses from Oct. 26, 2006, through March 15, 2007.
"Our customers can shop for a new PC with confidence this holiday season because of the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista and Office Technology Guarantee programs," said Mike Sievert, corporate vice president of Windows Client Marketing at Microsoft. "These programs ensure people will have a great experience with their Windows XP-based PCs today, and an even better one when Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office release become available."
A number of computer manufacturers worldwide have confirmed plans to participate in the Express Upgrade to Windows Vista program. PCs carrying the Windows Vista Capable logo may be eligible for the program, but upgrade offers will vary among PC makers. The upgrade to Windows Vista may be offered for free or at a discounted price (shipping and
 
 
handling charges may also apply), and customers should check with PC makers for their specific offers. Consumers can also visit http://www.windowsvista.com/expressupgrade for more information.
Microsoft will be working with participating smaller PC makers, known as system builders, to provide customers with upgrade discount coupons for Windows Vista with the purchase of a qualifying Windows Vista Capable PC. The offer will vary by region, but in the U.S. upgrades from Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 to Windows Vista Home Premium, and upgrades from Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition to Windows Vista Business and Windows Vista Business 64, will be offered for a nominal fee. Upgrades from Windows XP Home Edition to Windows Vista Home Basic and to Windows Vista Home Premium will be offered at a 50 percent discount from the boxed product upgrade price, plus the cost of shipping and handling.
Microsoft will also enable customers to upgrade to comparable editions of the 2007 Microsoft Office release when they purchase PCs pre-installed with qualifying Microsoft Office 2003 software. For Microsoft Office purchases made through participating computer manufacturers in qualifying locations, customers will receive upgrades to comparable 2007 Microsoft Office release products for the cost of shipping and handling when the product becomes available. For purchases of Microsoft Office through a system builder, customers will need to provide valid proof of purchase and cover shipping and handling costs associated with the upgrade. Customers in North America will receive a coupon with the purchase that must also be submitted.
Similar programs are available on a region-by-region basis for Microsoft Office 2003 and Windows XP boxed product. Customers should check with their local retailers to learn more about specific programs.
 
 
For all holiday purchases of machines loaded with Windows XP, Microsoft recommends that buyers consider Windows Vista Capable PCs that are designated Premium Ready, and specifically such PCs loaded with Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition or Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005. PCs that are designated as Premium Ready can deliver the core Windows Vista experiences, plus features such as the Windows Aero user experience and Media Center.* For more information about what version of Windows Vista is right for them, buyers can visit http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/getready/capable.mspx.

On October 26, 2006, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced first quarter revenue of $10.81 billion for the period ended September 30, 2006, an 11% increase over the same quarter of the prior year. Operating income for the quarter was $4.47 billion, an 11% increase compared with $4.05 billion in the prior year period. Net income and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $3.48 billion and $0.35 per share. For the same quarter of the previous year, net income and diluted earnings per share were $3.14 billion and $0.29, including a $0.02 per share charge for certain legal charges.
REDMOND, Wash.  October 26, 2006 
"The solid revenue results for the quarter were at the top end of our expectations and represent a very good start to the fiscal year," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft.
Server & Tools revenue increased 17% over the comparable quarter in the prior year, reflecting healthy performance for offerings such as SQL Server 2005, Windows Server, Visual Studio 2005 and BizTalk Server. SQL Server experienced revenue growth of over 30%, as customers are increasingly deploying SQL Server for their mission critical, transaction oriented databases.
Entertainment and Devices Division revenue growth of 70% over the prior year was driven by demand for Xbox 360 consoles, software, peripherals, and Xbox Live. Xbox 360 has sold 6 million consoles worldwide life to date and achieved record cumulative attach rates for software and peripherals in the United States, while Xbox Live passed the four million member mark during the quarter.
The company has made considerable progress toward delivering two highly anticipated products to customers with the forthcoming releases of Windows Vista and the
2007 Microsoft Office system. During the quarter, the first release candidate for Windows Vista was made available to nearly 5 million customers worldwide, and the beta 2 version of the 2007 Microsoft Office system was in use by over 3 million customers.
"The strong results are a reflection of our solid execution and ongoing focus on operational excellence," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "As we look to the upcoming releases of Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Exchange Server 2007, we are excited about these products and believe they will deliver unprecedented levels of business value to our customers."
Business Outlook
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the fiscal second quarter ending Dec. 31, 2006:
 
 
 
Note: The guidance above includes the impact of a approximately $1.5 billion of revenue deferral from the second to the third quarter, primarily related to the technology guarantee programs announced on October 24, 2006 for Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2007:

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 25, 2007, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced record revenue of $12.54 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, a 6% increase over the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $3.47 billion, $2.63 billion and $0.26, respectively.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 25, 2007 
These results reflect the deferral of $1.64 billion of revenue and operating income, $1.13 billion of net income and $0.11 of diluted earnings per share from the second to the third fiscal quarter, due primarily to the technology guarantee programs that were announced on October 24, 2006 for Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office release. Revenue growth over the same period of the prior year would have been 14 percentage points higher before the technology guarantee programs.
"Results this quarter exceeded our expectations across the board, with revenue growth at or above our high end guidance for all divisions," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Healthy PC and server markets as well as broad-based business and consumer demand for Microsoft offerings fueled revenue growth this quarter."
The same period last year marked the launches of Xbox 360, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 3.0. One year later, these products have contributed over $1.0 billion of revenue growth.
"The execution of our field sales and marketing teams were a major contributor to this quarter's extremely positive results," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Customers have responded positively with strong contract renewals and license sales. We are pleased with such strong financial results and look forward to making Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system widely available to all customers next week."
Business Outlook
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2007:
 
 
 
Note: The guidance above includes the impact of third quarter recognition of revenue deferred from the first and second fiscal quarters, primarily related to the technology guarantee programs.
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2007:

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft to Acquire aQuantive, Inc.
Company Details Plans to Build Internet-Wide Advertising Platform for
Advertisers, Publishers and Ad Agencies
Microsoft Corp. today announced it will acquire aQuantive, Inc., for $66.50 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $6 billion. This deal expands upon the Company's previously outlined vision to provide the advertising industry with a world class, Internet-wide advertising platform, as well as a set of tools and services that help its constituents generate the highest possible return on their advertising investments.
REDMOND, Wash.  May 18, 2007 
"The advertising industry is evolving and growing at an incredible pace, moving increasingly toward online and IP-served platforms, which dramatically increases the importance of software for this industry," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer of Microsoft. "Today's announcement represents the next step in the evolution of our ad network from our initial investment in MSN, to the broader Microsoft network including Xbox Live, Windows Live and Office Live, and now to the full capacity of the Internet. Microsoft is intensely committed to creating a thriving advertising business and to partnering closely with all key constituencies in this industry to help maximize the digital advertising opportunity for all."
The aQuantive acquisition enables Microsoft to strengthen relationships with advertisers, agencies and publishers by enhancing the Company's world-class advertising platforms and services beyond its current capabilities to serve MSN. The acquisition also provides Microsoft increased depth in building and supporting next generation advertising solutions and environments such as cross media planning, video-on-demand and IPTV. Combining aQuantive's technologies and services with Microsoft's portfolio will provide value for the industry's key constituencies as follows:
 
 
 
Founded in 1997, aQuantive, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQNT) is the parent company of one of the industry's most successful families of digital marketing service and technology companies, encompassing three primary brands.
 
 
 
 
"Combining the talented people and deep technology and service expertise of these two companies will help make buying and selling media simpler, smarter and more cost effective for advertisers, agencies and publishers alike," said Kevin Johnson, president, Platforms and Services Division at Microsoft. "Joining the capabilities of these groups is an important step toward our goal of becoming an industry leading, Internet-wide advertising platform."
"aQuantive's mission has been to leverage the power of digital marketing services and technologies to drive measurable results for our clients," said Brian P. McAndrews, chief executive officer of aQuantive. "Microsoft has set a leading example in prioritizing industry partnership, transparency, measurement and quality, and we look forward to combining forces and bringing the value of our combined assets to bear for the benefit of advertisers, ad agencies and publishers."
The deal is expected to be completed in the first half of Microsoft's fiscal year 2008. The acquisition is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial guidance previously issued by the Company.
aQuantive, which has approximately 2600 employees, will continue to operate from its Seattle headquarters as part of Microsoft's Online Services Business. The combination of Microsoft and aQuantive takes the Company's advertising platform to the next level in its ability to serve Microsoft's first party audience assets like MSN, Windows Live, Xbox Live, and Office Live, as well as for third party publishers and applications such as Facebook and Activision game titles.
At 5:45 a.m. PDT today, Microsoft will hold a teleconference to discuss the acquisition.

(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced that it will expand its global Xbox 360 warranty coverage. Any Xbox 360 customer who experiences a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights will now be covered by a three year warranty from date of purchase. All other existing Xbox 360 warranty policies remain in place.
REDMOND, Wash.  July 5, 2007 
As a result of what Microsoft views as an unacceptable number of repairs to Xbox 360 consoles, the company conducted extensive investigations into potential sources of general hardware failures. Having identified a number of factors which can cause general hardware failures indicated by three red flashing lights on the console, Microsoft has made improvements to the console and is enhancing its Xbox 360 warranty policy for existing and new customers.
Microsoft stands behind its products and is taking responsibility to repair or replace any existing Xbox 360 console that experiences the "three flashing red lights" error message within three years from time of purchase free of charge, including shipping costs. Microsoft will take a $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion pre-tax charge to earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 for anticipated costs under its current and enhanced Xbox 360 policies.
"The majority of Xbox 360 owners are having a great experience with their console and have from day one. But, this problem has caused frustration for some of our customers and for that, we sincerely apologize," said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's Entertainment & Devices Division. "We value our community tremendously and look at this as an investment in our customer base. We look forward to great things to come."
For any customer who has previously paid for repair expenses related to the three flashing lights error message on the Xbox 360 console, Microsoft will retroactively reimburse them.
At 2:30 p.m. PDT today, Microsoft will hold a teleconference for financial analysts and investors with Robbie Bach, president of Entertainment and Devices, Chris Liddell, senior vice president and chief financial officer, and Frank Brod, corporate vice president and chief accounting officer to discuss today's announcement. To participate, U.S. residents can dial +1-888-459-9165, and those outside the United States can dial +1-773-799-3324. The passcode is MSFT.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $13.37 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, a 13% increase over the same period of the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.31. Excluding $0.08 of previously announced charges primarily related to Xbox 360 warranty policies, earnings per share would have been $0.39, an increase of 26% over the same period of the prior year when also adjusted for certain items.
REDMOND, Wash.  July 19, 2007 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007, Microsoft announced revenue of $51.12 billion, a 15% increase over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share for the year were $1.42. Excluding certain items, earnings per share would have been $1.49, an increase of 17% over the prior year when also adjusted for certain items. $31 billion in cash, or approximately 175% of operating cash flow, was returned to shareholders during the year through share buybacks and dividends.
"Surpassing $50 billion in annual sales is a testament to the innovation and value that our product groups delivered into the marketplace, as well as the outstanding execution by our field sales, marketing teams and partners to bring that value to life with our customers," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "In fiscal year 2008, we will continue to drive growth through new product offerings, such as Windows Server 2008, Visual Studio 2008, SQL Server 2008, Office PerformancePoint Server 2007, and Microsoft Dynamics Live CRM."
This fiscal year marked the general availability of Microsoft's flagship products, Windows Vista and the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Revenue growth was primarily
 
driven by solid customer acceptance of these products, as well as increasing sales of existing products such as SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, and Xbox 360 consoles.
"Our results this quarter cap off an extremely strong fiscal year for the company," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "We have healthy core businesses and are strategically investing in growth opportunities, which will build on our success and contribute to continued double-digit revenue and earnings growth in fiscal year 2008."

Summary
 
Fourth Quarter
Our revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Windows Vista, both of which became generally available in January 2007, and increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and client access license suites. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $231 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue.
Our operating income growth was driven primarily by the increased revenue and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated with Xbox 360 and Windows Vista and increased sales and marketing expenses. Legal costs incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2007 were not significant. In July 2007, we expanded our global Xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. As a result, we recorded a $1.06 billion charge for anticipated costs under the warranty policy, inventory write-downs, and product returns. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount-related costs and increased sales support costs from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners. Headcount-related costs increased 13%, driven by a 10% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
Full Fiscal Year
Our revenue growth was driven primarily by licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Windows Vista, increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio, and increased Xbox 360 console sales. Foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on consolidated revenue during the year.
Our operating income growth was driven primarily by the increased revenue and decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased cost of revenue associated with Xbox 360 and Windows Vista, increased data center costs in our Online Services Business, and increased sales and marketing expenses. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by increased headcount-related costs and marketing costs related to recent product launches. Headcount-related costs increased 15%, driven by a 10% increase in headcount over the past twelve months and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
 
In July 2006, we announced a change in our operating segments reflecting the previously announced reorganizations. We have five operating segments: Client, Server and Tools, the Online Services Business ("OSB"), the Microsoft Business Division ("MBD"), and the Entertainment and Devices Division ("EDD"). Prior fiscal year information has been restated to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the business group level in fiscal year 2007.
The revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is analyzed separately.
Client
 
Client offerings consist of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows XP Professional, XP Media Center Edition, XP Tablet PC Edition, Vista Business, Vista Home Premium, and Vista Ultimate. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Home Basic. Client revenue growth correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed ("OEM premium mix"), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Fourth Quarter
Client revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista. OEM revenue increased $424 million or 15% driven by 11% growth in OEM licenses from increased PC unit shipments while revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems grew $37 million or 7%. During the quarter, the OEM premium mix increased 17 percentage points to 72% driven by the demand for Windows Vista Home Premium. Continued PC shipment growth also contributed to the increase in revenue. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 11% to 13% driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased primarily reflecting the increased revenue and decreased research and development expenses, partially offset by increased Windows Vista product costs. The decrease in research and development expenses was driven by a decrease in headcount-related costs and reflects the completion of product development on Windows Vista. Headcount-related costs decreased 10%, driven by a 1% decrease in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
Client revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of Windows Vista. OEM revenue increased $1.46 billion or 13% driven by 13% growth in OEM license units while revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $422 million or 21%. During the year, the OEM Premium Mix increased 16 percentage points to 68%. Based on our preliminary estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew 10% to 12% driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue and decreased research and development costs, partially offset by increased Windows Vista product costs and increased sales and marketing
 
expenses for launch-related programs. The decrease in research and development costs reflects the capitalization of certain Windows Vista software development costs and completion of product development on Windows Vista. Headcount-related costs decreased 3%, driven by a 1% decrease in headcount and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses ("CAL") for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Fourth Quarter
Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training, and certification revenue increased $239 million or 11%. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and CAL suites, and reflects broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server which grew over 15%. Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue increased $152 million or 33% primarily due to higher demand for Premier services in corporate enterprises. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $72 million or a three percentage point increase in revenue.
Server and Tools operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by growth in headcount-related costs and cost of revenue for services. Headcount-related costs increased 12%, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue increased $88 million or 18% reflecting growth in services provided.
Full Fiscal Year
Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools, training, and certification revenue increased $1.12 billion or 14%. This increase was primarily driven by increased revenue associated with SQL Server, Windows Server, and Visual Studio. The results reflect broad adoption of Windows Server products, especially SQL Server which grew over 20%. Consulting, Premier, and Professional product support services revenue increased $404 million or 24% primarily due to higher demand for Premier services in corporate enterprises. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $165 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue.
Server and Tools operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by growth in headcount-related costs and cost of revenue for services. Headcount-related costs increased 12%, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Cost of revenue increased $243 million or 13% reflecting growth in services provided.
 
Online Services Business
 
 
OSB provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. OSB also provides a variety of online services such as MSN Internet Access, MSN Premium Web Services and OneCare. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. We have transitioned to adCenter, our own platform, for online delivery of advertising in the U.S. and certain international markets. We continue to launch new online initiatives and expect to do so in the future. In fiscal year 2007, we launched Windows Live Search and Live.com in 54 international markets, Live Local Search in the U.S. and U.K., beta versions of MSN Soapbox (our expansion of the MSN Video experience), Virtual Earth
TM
3D, Windows Live Hotmail, and other offerings.
Fourth Quarter
OSB revenue increased driven primarily by advertising revenue which grew $135 million or 33% to $544 million. This increase was primarily due to growth in advertising for search, home page, email, and messaging services. The increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a $34 million or 31% decline in access revenue as subscribers continue to migrate to broadband or other competitively priced service providers.
OSB operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue which grew $98 million or 42% and increased headcount-related costs as a result of continued search and advertising platform investments. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and royalties. Headcount-related costs increased 15%, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
Full Fiscal Year
OSB revenue increased driven primarily by advertising revenue which grew $314 million or 21% to $1.84 billion. This increase was primarily due to growth in advertising for search, home page, email, and messaging services. The increase in advertising revenue was partially offset by a $156 million or 31% decrease in access revenue. At June 30, 2007, we estimate that OSB had over 310 million active Hotmail accounts and over 280 million Messenger accounts.
OSB operating loss increased driven primarily by increased cost of revenue which grew $352 million or 45% and increased headcount-related costs as a result of continued search and advertising platform investments. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily driven by increased data center costs, online content expenses, and royalties. Headcount-related costs increased 30%, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
Microsoft Business Division
 
MBD offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity
 
through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary partsbusiness revenue which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue, and consumer revenue which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales, OEM revenue, and sales of pre-installed versions of Office in Japan.
Fourth Quarter
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Revenue from consumer sales increased $127 million or 15% while revenue from business sales increased $601 million or 20%. The increase in business revenue includes a 24% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $112 million or a three percentage point increase in revenue.
MBD operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue primarily associated with the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects increased headcount-related expenses, increased sales support costs from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners, and increased launch-related marketing expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 11%, driven by a 6% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Full Fiscal Year
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Revenue from consumer sales increased $371 million or 11% while revenue from business sales increased $1.54 billion or 14%. The increase in business revenue includes a 21% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $248 million or a two percentage point increase in revenue.
MBD operating income increased reflecting the increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue primarily associated with the 2007 Microsoft Office system. The increase in sales and marketing expenses reflects increased headcount-related expenses, increased sales support costs from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners, and increased launch-related marketing expenses. Headcount-related costs increased 10%, driven by a 6% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense.
Entertainment and Devices Division
 
EDD products include the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, consumer software and hardware products, the Zune digital music and entertainment device, TV platform products for the interactive television industry, and mobile and embedded devices (Windows Mobile software platform, Windows Embedded device operating system and Windows Automotive). The success of video game consoles is determined by console innovation and quality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, online offerings, and the market share of the console. We believe that the functionality of the Xbox 360 console, games portfolio, and online offerings are well-positioned relative to recently launched competitive consoles.
 
Fourth Quarter
EDD revenue decreased primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 console sales, partially offset by Zune sales and increased Xbox accessories and video game sales. We shipped 0.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, compared to 1.8 million Xbox 360 consoles in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Since the Xbox 360 console was launched in November 2005, we have shipped 11.6 million consoles. Xbox and PC game revenue decreased $265 million or 28%. Zune, which was launched in November 2006, consumer hardware and software, and TV platforms revenue increased $113 million or 56%. Mobile and embedded devices revenue increased $30 million or 21% driven by sales growth in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.
EDD operating loss increased primarily due to the $1.06 billion Xbox 360 charge, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 console manufacturing costs. Headcount-related costs increased 19%, driven by a 9% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
Full Fiscal Year
EDD revenue increased primarily due to increased Xbox 360 console sales, Zune sales, and increased Xbox accessories and video game sales. We shipped 6.6 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2007 as compared to 5.0 million consoles during fiscal year 2006. Xbox and PC game revenue increased $650 million or 19% as a result of the increased number of Xbox 360 platform sales, partially offset by decreased sales of the first generation Xbox console and related accessories and video games. Zune, consumer hardware and software, and TV platforms revenue increased $539 million or 65%. Mobile and Embedded Devices revenue increased $138 million or 28% driven by sales growth in Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems.
EDD operating loss increased primarily due to the $1.06 billion Xbox 360 charge and Zune launch-related expenses. The increase in operating loss was partially offset by increased Xbox 360 platform sales and decreased Xbox 360 console manufacturing costs. Headcount-related costs increased 15%, driven by a 9% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Corporate-Level Results
 
Certain corporate-level results are not allocated to our segments. Those results include expenses related to corporate operations associated with broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies.
Fourth Quarter
Corporate-level expenses decreased primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies offset by increased headcount-related costs. We incurred insignificant legal costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and $408 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year which included a 281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission in July 2006 related to its 2004 decision in its competition law investigation of Microsoft. Headcount-related costs increased 21%, driven by a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
 
Full Fiscal Year
Corporate-level expenses increased primarily driven by increased headcount-related costs offset by decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. Headcount-related costs increased 25%, driven by a 19% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount. We incurred $511 million in legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2007, primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement. We incurred $1.32 billion in legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2006, which included settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. as well as other intellectual property and antitrust matters, the European Commission fine of 281 million ($351 million), and an extension payment to Sun Microsystems, Inc.
Cost of Revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory write-downs, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue increased in the three months ended June 30, 2007, primarily driven by the Xbox 360 charge and increased Windows Vista product costs. Cost of revenue increased during the twelve months ended June 30, 2007, primarily driven by the Xbox 360 charge, increased Windows Vista product costs, increased OSB data center costs, and costs associated with the growth in consulting services.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development costs increased primarily due to increased headcount-related costs. Headcount-related costs increased 7% and 8%, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2007, reflecting a 9% growth in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
Sales and Marketing
 
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2007, primarily because of increased headcount-related costs and increased marketing costs related to recent product launches. The increase during the three months ended June 30, 2007, also reflects increased sales support costs from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners. Headcount-related costs increased 18% and 22%, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2007, driven by an 11% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.
General and Administrative
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs decreased during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2007, primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by increased headcount-related costs. We incurred insignificant legal costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and $408 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year which included the 281 million ($351 million) fine imposed by the European Commission. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2007, and 2006, we incurred $511 million and $1.32 billion, respectively, of legal charges primarily related to antitrust and unfair competition consumer class actions, intellectual property claims, and extension payments to Sun Microsystems, Inc. under our existing Limited Patent Covenant and Standstill Agreement. Legal charges in the twelve months ended June 30, 2006 also included settlement expense of $361 million related to our settlement with RealNetworks, Inc. and the European Commission fine. Headcount-related costs increased 14% and 15%, respectively, during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2007, driven by a 12% increase in headcount and an increase in salaries and benefits for existing headcount.
Investment Income and Income Taxes
Investment Income
Fourth Quarter
The components of investment income and other were as follows:
 
The decline in dividends and interest income reflects a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments, partially offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. The increase in net gains on investments was primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments in the current quarter. Other-than-temporary impairments were not significant in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007
 
and were $317 million in the comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year. Derivative losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. The decline in other gains and losses was primarily driven by gains recognized in the prior period that resulted from the restructuring of joint venture relationships between Microsoft and NBC Universal, Inc. related to MSNBC Cable L.L.C and MSNBC Interactive News, L.L.C.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Full Fiscal Year
 
The decline in dividends and interest income reflects a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest-bearing investments, partly offset by higher interest rates received on our fixed-income investments. The increase in net gains on investments was primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments and gains on sales of fixed-income investments in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period, partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments. Other-than-temporary impairments were not significant in fiscal year 2007 and were $408 million in fiscal year 2006. Derivative losses in fiscal year 2007 were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues. The decline in other gains and losses was primarily due to gains recognized in the prior period that resulted from the restructuring of the joint venture relationships between Microsoft and NBC Universal, Inc.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 was 29% and for full fiscal year 2007 was 30%. The decreased rate for the fourth quarter was due to a higher mix of earnings in low rate tax jurisdictions. The fiscal year 2007 recurring effective tax rate was 31% and was offset by a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 was 34% and for full fiscal year 2006 was 31%. The increased rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 resulted primarily from the European Commission fine of 281 million ($351 million) which was not tax deductible. During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of $108 million from the resolution of state audits.
Financial Condition
Cash and equivalents and short-term investments totaled $23.41 billion and $34.16 billion as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Equity and other investments were $10.12 billion and $9.23 billion as of June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $29.46 billion at June 30, 2007. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
 
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and prior versions, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solution products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, and TV platform for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2007 increased $2.36 billion from March 31, 2007, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $2.39 billion, a $129 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $104 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services. Unearned revenue as of June 30, 2007 increased $1.74 billion from June 30, 2006, reflecting additions to unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that outpaced recognitions by $1.67 billion, a $227 million decrease in revenue deferred for undelivered elements, and a $298 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services and subscription services.
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2007:
 
 
Cash Flows
During the three months ended June 30, 2007, cash flow from operations increased $1.12 billion from the three months ended June 30, 2006, to $4.40 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by the 13% revenue growth, along with a $1.16 billion decrease in cash outflow for other current assets reflecting the fiscal year 2006 spending for inventory and product costs related to Xbox 360. Cash used for financing was $6.98 billion, an increase of $2.30 billion, due to a $3.24 billion increase in common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $972 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash from investing was $1.08 billion, a decrease of $2.66 billion, due to a $2.07 billion decline in our securities lending activity where cash collateral is received from the counterparty along with $407 million from increased acquisitions of companies and additions to property and equipment.

Exhibit 99.1
For Release 7 a.m. PDT
Aug. 13, 2007
Microsoft Corp. has completed its acquisition of aQuantive Inc. The acquisition will help Microsoft deliver on its previously outlined goal to provide the advertising industry with a world-class advertising platform across devices and media that will create the best experiences for users, advertisers and publishers.
REDMOND, Wash.  Aug. 13, 2007 
Microsoft also created the Advertiser and Publisher Solutions (APS) Group. This new business group will be responsible for building Microsoft's monetization engine to serve the Advertiser and Publisher community. The APS team will assume responsibility for building and marketing all ad platforms, including Atlas, DRIVEpm, MSNDR and Microsoft AdCenter, along with emerging media types such as in-game and mobile ads, and the agency arm Avenue A | Razorfish. The APS group will be run by Brian McAndrews, CEO of aQuantive, who will report directly to Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's Platforms & Services Division (PSD).
"Today we take a significant step forward in our ability to capture share of the $40 billion online ad opportunity and the larger $600 billion ad market, which is rapidly shifting to the world of online and IP-served platforms, including TV and gaming," Johnson said. "The addition of aQuantive's technologies and people to the Microsoft portfolio is a core, strategic investment and step forward in our plans to become one of the top two online advertising platforms in the industry."
Microsoft Completes Acquisition of aQuantive, Creates Advertiser and Publisher Solutions Group
 
The leadership team reporting to Johnson responsible for Microsoft's expanding efforts in advertising and audience includes the following:
 
 
 
Yusuf Mehdi will take on the newly formed role in PSD of senior vice president, Strategic Partnerships, where he will be focused on overseeing international mergers, acquisitions and partnerships; managing strategic accounts; and forging relationships with early stage startups and venture capital firms. Mike Galgon, an aQuantive co-founder, has been named chief advertising strategist and will report to McAndrews.
Microsoft's other recent advertising-related acquisitions, including Massive Inc. and ScreenTonic, will continue to report to Cory Van Arsdale as part of the Emerging Media Group within APS. The newly formed Emerging Media Group will report to Karl Siebrecht, president of Atlas. The Microsoft Digital Advertising Solutions sales force will continue to be a part of the Online Services Group.
aQuantive's employees will continue to be located in their downtown Seattle offices. Upon close of Microsoft's acquisition of AdECN, CEO Bill Urschel and his team will report into Alex Gounares, corporate vice president, adCenter and Commerce, part of Satya Nadella's Search & Advertising Platform group. AdECN will maintain its offices near Santa Barbara, Calif.
 
Microsoft Completes Acquisition of aQuantive, Creates Advertiser and Publisher Solutions Group
 
The aQuantive acquisition, excluding transaction costs, is not expected to have a significant impact on previously issued fiscal 2008 guidance for operating income and earnings per share. Microsoft will provide updated financial guidance on its first-quarter earnings call scheduled for Oct. 25, 2007.

Microsoft's businesses of Client, Microsoft Business Division, and Server and Tools grew combined revenue in excess of 20%, and experienced robust demand for Windows Vista, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Windows Server, and SQL Server.
"Customer demand for Windows Vista this quarter continued to build with double-digit growth in multi-year agreements by businesses and with the vast majority of consumers purchasing premium editions," said Kevin Johnson, president of the Platforms and Services Division at Microsoft.
During the quarter, Microsoft's two consumer focused divisions passed milestones with the successful close of the company's largest ever acquisition, aQuantive, and Halo 3 achieving the biggest entertainment launch day in history.
"Backed by an amazing product line-up, our sales force, marketing teams, and partners delivered another excellent quarter," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft.

On January 24, 2008, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2007. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
(d) The following items are filed as exhibits to this report:
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced second quarter records for revenue, operating income and diluted earnings per share of $16.37 billion, $6.48 billion and $0.50, respectively. Compared to the year ago period, these figures represent growth of 30%, 87% and 92% for revenue, operating income and diluted earnings per share, respectively.
REDMOND, Wash.  January 24, 2008 
Results in the prior year were impacted by the deferral of $1.64 billion of revenue and operating income and $0.11 of diluted earnings per share from the second to the third quarter of fiscal 2007, due primarily to technology guarantee programs. Without these deferrals, second quarter growth rates for revenue, operating income and earnings per share would be 15%, 27% and 32%, respectively.
"Revenue of over $16 billion this quarter exceeds our previous record by $2 billion," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "We are extremely pleased by the broad based strength of our business performance and field execution. Throughout the first half of our fiscal year, all of our businesses met or beat our expectations."
Since Windows Vista became generally available one year ago, Microsoft's Client business has grown over 20% on average and sales of Windows Vista have surpassed 100 million licenses.
"We are pleased with the progress of Windows Vista in the market. We've hit our stride with partners and customers and are looking forward to the release of our first service pack later this quarter," said Kevin Johnson, president of the Platforms and Services Division at Microsoft.
 
Sales to business customers remained brisk in the quarter with Microsoft Business Division and the Server and Tools business each experiencing double-digit revenue growth rates over the prior year and together increased revenue over $1 billion versus the comparable quarter last year. Microsoft Business Division generated 23% business revenue growth driven by the versions of Microsoft Office, Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Exchange that were launched last November.
"We are in the midst of another strong year with great momentum heading into calendar year 2008," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We continue to see healthy demand from both businesses and consumers in the United States and our growth in emerging markets is especially strong. Looking across Brazil, Russia, India and China, our field revenue reached a combined growth rate over 65% this quarter. As we look ahead, our Windows Server 2008 launch, with our virtualization solution, will further our quest to bring exceptional value to our customers."
Microsoft rolled out new consumer focused offerings during the quarter such as Windows Home Server, new versions of the Zune media player and the next generation of Windows Live Online Services. Exiting the calendar year, the life to date sales of Xbox 360 consoles reached 17.7 million units, representing a 70% increase from the prior year.
Business Outlook
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending March 31, 2008:
 
 
 
 
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2008:

Item 8.01. Other Events.
     On February 1, 2008, Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") issued a press release announcing its proposal to acquire Yahoo! Inc. ("Yahoo!"). The proposal was communicated on January 31, 2008 in a letter from Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer, to Roy Bostock, chairman of the board of Yahoo!, and Jerry Yang, Yahoo!'s chief executive officer. The press release announcing the proposal, including the full text of the proposal letter delivered to Mr. Bostock and Mr. Yang, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by this reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
99.1 Microsoft Corporation press release, dated February 1, 2008.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
     Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) today announced that it has made a proposal to the Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) Board of Directors to acquire all the outstanding shares of Yahoo! common stock for per share consideration of $31 representing a total equity value of approximately $44.6 billion. Microsoft's proposal would allow the Yahoo! shareholders to elect to receive cash or a fixed number of shares of Microsoft common stock, with the total consideration payable to Yahoo! shareholders consisting of one-half cash and one-half Microsoft common stock. The offer represents a 62 percent premium above the closing price of Yahoo! common stock on Jan. 31, 2008.
REDMOND, Wash.  Feb. 1, 2008 
     "We have great respect for Yahoo!, and together we can offer an increasingly exciting set of solutions for consumers, publishers and advertisers while becoming better positioned to compete in the online services market," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer of Microsoft. "We believe our combination will deliver superior value to our respective shareholders and better choice and innovation to our customers and industry partners."
     "Our lives, our businesses, and even our society have been progressively transformed by the Web, and Yahoo! has played a pioneering role by building compelling, high-scale services and infrastructure," said Ray Ozzie, chief software architect at Microsoft. "The combination of these two great teams would enable us to jointly deliver a broad range of new experiences to our customers that neither of us would have achieved on our own."
 
     The online advertising market is growing at a very fast pace, from over $40 billion in 2007 to nearly $80 billion by 2010. The resulting benefits of scale along with the associated capital costs for advertising platform providers make this a time of industry consolidation and convergence. Today this market is increasingly dominated by one player. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! can offer a competitive choice while better fulfilling the needs of customers and partners.
     "The combined assets and strong services focus of these two companies will enable us to achieve scale economics while reaching R&D critical mass to deliver innovation breakthroughs," said Kevin Johnson, president of the Platforms & Services Division of Microsoft. "The industry will be well served by having more than one strong player, offering more value and real choice to advertisers, publishers and consumers."
     The combination will create a more efficient company with synergies in four areas: scale economics driven by audience critical mass and increased value for advertisers; combined engineering talent to accelerate innovation; operational efficiencies through elimination of redundant cost; and the ability to innovate in emerging user experiences such as video and mobile. Microsoft believes these four areas will generate at least $1 billion in annual synergy for the combined entity.
     Microsoft has developed a plan and process that will include the employees of both companies to focus on the integration of the combined business. Microsoft intends to offer significant retention packages to Yahoo! engineers, key leaders and employees across all disciplines.
     Microsoft believes this proposed combination would receive all necessary regulatory approvals and expects that the proposed transaction would be completed in the second half of calendar year 2008.
     Microsoft is also committed to working closely with Yahoo! management and its Board of Directors as they, along with Yahoo! shareholders, evaluate this compelling proposal.
     Below is the text of the letter that Microsoft sent to Yahoo!'s Board of Directors:
     January 31, 2008
 
Board of Directors Yahoo! Inc. 701 First Avenue Sunnyvale, CA 94089 Attention: Roy Bostock, Chairman Attention: Jerry Yang, Chief Executive Officer
Dear Members of the Board:
I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors of Microsoft to make a proposal for a business combination of Microsoft and Yahoo!. Under our proposal, Microsoft would acquire all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo! common stock for per share consideration of $31 based on Microsoft's closing share price on January 31, 2008, payable in the form of $31 in cash or 0.9509 of a share of Microsoft common stock. Microsoft would provide each Yahoo! shareholder with the ability to choose whether to receive the consideration in cash or Microsoft common stock, subject to pro-ration so that in the aggregate one-half of the Yahoo! common shares will be exchanged for shares of Microsoft common stock and one-half of the Yahoo! common shares will be converted into the right to receive cash. Our proposal is not subject to any financing condition.
Our proposal represents a 62% premium above the closing price of Yahoo! common stock of $19.18 on January 31, 2008. The implied premium for the operating assets of the company clearly is considerably greater when adjusted for the minority, non-controlled assets and cash. By whatever financial measure you use  EBITDA, free cash flow, operating cash flow, net income, or analyst target prices  this proposal represents a compelling value realization event for your shareholders.
We believe that Microsoft common stock represents a very attractive investment opportunity for Yahoo!'s shareholders. Microsoft has generated revenue growth of 15%, earnings growth of 26%, and a return on equity of 35% on average for the last three years. Microsoft's share price has generated shareholder returns of 8% during the last one year period and 28% during the last three year period, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. It is our view that Microsoft has significant potential upside given the continued solid growth in our core businesses, the recent launch of Windows Vista, and other strategic initiatives.
Microsoft's consistent belief has been that the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo! clearly represents the best way to deliver maximum value to our respective shareholders, as well as create a more efficient and competitive company that would provide greater value and service to our customers. In late 2006 and early 2007, we jointly explored a broad range of ways in which our two companies might work together. These discussions were based on a vision that the online businesses of Microsoft and Yahoo! should be aligned in some way to create a more effective competitor in the online marketplace. We discussed a number of alternatives ranging from commercial partnerships to a merger proposal, which you rejected. While a commercial partnership may have made sense at one time, Microsoft believes that the only alternative now is the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo! that we are proposing.
In February 2007, I received a letter from your Chairman indicating the view of the Yahoo! Board that "now is not the right time from the perspective of our shareholders to enter into discussions regarding an acquisition transaction." According to that letter, the principal reason for this view was the Yahoo! Board's confidence in the "potential upside" if management
 
successfully executed on a reformulated strategy based on certain operational initiatives, such as Project Panama, and a significant organizational realignment. A year has gone by, and the competitive situation has not improved.
While online advertising growth continues, there are significant benefits of scale in advertising platform economics, in capital costs for search index build-out, and in research and development, making this a time of industry consolidation and convergence. Today, the market is increasingly dominated by one player who is consolidating its dominance through acquisition. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! can offer a credible alternative for consumers, advertisers, and publishers. Synergies of this combination fall into four areas:
We would value the opportunity to further discuss with you how to optimize the integration of our respective businesses to create a leading global technology company with exceptional display and search advertising capabilities. You should also be aware that we intend to offer significant retention packages to your engineers, key leaders and employees across all disciplines.
We have dedicated considerable time and resources to an analysis of a potential transaction and are confident that the combination will receive all necessary regulatory approvals. We look forward to discussing this with you, and both our internal legal team and outside counsel are available to meet with your counsel at their earliest convenience.
Our proposal is subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger agreement and our having the opportunity to conduct certain limited and confirmatory due diligence. In addition, because a portion of the aggregate merger consideration would consist of Microsoft common stock, we would provide Yahoo! the opportunity to conduct appropriate limited due diligence with respect to Microsoft. We are prepared to deliver a draft merger agreement to you and begin discussions immediately.
In light of the significance of this proposal to your shareholders and ours, as well as the potential for selective disclosures, our intention is to publicly release the text of this letter tomorrow morning.
 
Due to the importance of these discussions and the value represented by our proposal, we expect the Yahoo! Board to engage in a full review of our proposal. My leadership team and I would be happy to make ourselves available to meet with you and your Board at your earliest convenience. Depending on the nature of your response, Microsoft reserves the right to pursue all necessary steps to ensure that Yahoo!'s shareholders are provided with the opportunity to realize the value inherent in our proposal.
We believe this proposal represents a unique opportunity to create significant value for Yahoo!'s shareholders and employees, and the combined company will be better positioned to provide an enhanced value proposition to users and advertisers. We hope that you and your Board share our enthusiasm, and we look forward to a prompt and favorable reply.
Sincerely yours,
/s/ Steven A. Ballmer

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
REDMOND, Wash., Feb. 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT  News) today issued the following statement in response to the announcement by Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO  News) that its Board of Directors has rejected Microsoft's previously announced proposal to acquire Yahoo!:
It is unfortunate that Yahoo! has not embraced our full and fair proposal to combine our companies. Based on conversations with stakeholders of both companies, we are confident that moving forward promptly to consummate a transaction is in the best interests of all parties.
We are offering shareholders superior value and the opportunity to participate in the upside of the combined company. The combination also offers an increasingly exciting set of solutions for consumers, publishers and advertisers while becoming better positioned to compete in the online services market.
A Microsoft-Yahoo! combination will create a more effective company that would provide greater value and service to our customers. Furthermore, the combination will create a more competitive marketplace by establishing a compelling number two competitor for Internet search and online advertising.
The Yahoo! response does not change our belief in the strategic and financial merits of our proposal. As we have said previously, Microsoft reserves the right to pursue all necessary steps to ensure that Yahoo!'s shareholders are provided with the opportunity to realize the value inherent in our proposal.
On February 1, 2008, Microsoft announced a proposal to acquire all the outstanding shares of Yahoo! common stock for per share consideration of $31 representing a total equity value of approximately $44.6 billion and a 62 percent premium above the closing price of Yahoo! common stock based on the closing prices of the stocks of both companies on Jan. 31, 2008, the last day of trading prior to Microsoft's announcement. Microsoft's proposal would allow the Yahoo! shareholders to elect to receive cash or a fixed number of shares of Microsoft common stock, with the total consideration payable to Yahoo! shareholders consisting of one-half cash and one-half Microsoft common stock.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) today sent the following letter to the Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) Board of Directors:
REDMOND, Wash.  April 5, 2008 
April 5, 2008
Board of Directors
Yahoo! Inc.
701 First Avenue
Sunnyvale, CA 94089
Dear Members of the Board:
It has now been more than two months since we made our proposal to acquire Yahoo! at a 62% premium to its closing price on January 31, 2008, the day prior to our announcement. Our goal in making such a generous offer was to create the basis for a speedy and ultimately friendly transaction. Despite this, the pace of the last two months has been anything but speedy.
While there has been some limited interaction between management of our two companies, there has been no meaningful negotiation to conclude an agreement. We understand that you have been meeting to consider and assess your alternatives, including alternative transactions with others in the industry, but we've seen no indication that you have authorized Yahoo! management to negotiate with Microsoft. This is despite the fact that our proposal is the only alternative put forward that offers your shareholders full and fair value for their shares, gives every shareholder a vote on the future of the company, and enhances choice for content creators, advertisers, and consumers.
During these two months of inactivity, the Internet has continued to march on, while the public equity markets and overall economic conditions have weakened considerably, both in general and for other Internet-focused companies in particular. At the same time, public indicators suggest that Yahoo!'s search and page view shares have declined. Finally, you have adopted new plans at the company that have made any change of control more costly.
By any fair measure, the large premium we offered in January is even more significant today. We believe that the majority of your shareholders share this assessment, even after reviewing your public disclosures relating to your future prospects.
 
Given these developments, we believe now is the time for our respective companies to authorize teams to sit down and negotiate a definitive agreement on a combination of our companies that will deliver superior value to our respective shareholders, creating a more efficient and competitive company that will provide greater value and service to our customers. If we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks, we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders, including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the Yahoo! board. The substantial premium reflected in our initial proposal anticipated a friendly transaction with you. If we are forced to take an offer directly to your shareholders, that action will have an undesirable impact on the value of your company from our perspective which will be reflected in the terms of our proposal.
It is unfortunate that by choosing not to enter into substantive negotiations with us, you have failed to give due consideration to a transaction that has tremendous benefits for Yahoo!'s shareholders and employees. We think it is critically important not to let this window of opportunity pass.
Sincerely yours,
Steven A. Ballmer

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced third-quarter revenue, operating income and diluted earnings per share of $14.45 billion, $4.41 billion and $0.47, respectively. Operating income and earnings per share results included a charge of $1.42 billion, or $0.15 per share, for the European Commission fine. Income taxes were reduced by $0.15 per share for the resolution of a tax audit.
REDMOND, Wash.  April 24, 2008 
"Our third-quarter results demonstrate the benefit of our diversified business model," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer of Microsoft. "Our broad span across geographies, product categories and customer segments is a tremendous asset and supports our outlook for double-digit revenue, operating income and earnings per share growth for this fiscal year and also for fiscal year 2009."
Entertainment and Devices revenue for the quarter grew 68% over the comparable period last year driven by robust demand for Xbox 360 consoles. Cumulative console sales surpassed 19 million during the quarter, up 74% from a year ago. Server and Tools revenue growth of 18% added to its string of consecutive double-digit revenue growth quarters, which now stands at 23.
"The breadth of our product offerings and our ability to provide solutions across a range of customer and partner needs paid off again this quarter. The third quarter also kicked off the largest enterprise platform launch in our company history, which highlights Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer of Microsoft. "These new products strengthen our ability to help business customers and partners save money, optimize their people, processes and technology, and position IT as a strategic asset for their businesses."
Business Outlook
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2008:
 
 
 
Management offers the following preliminary guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2009:

On May 3, 2008, Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") issued a press release attaching a letter dated May 3, 2008 from Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer, to Jerry Yang, Yahoo! Inc.'s chief executive officer. The press release, together with the letter attached thereto, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report and is incorporated herein by this reference.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) today announced that it has withdrawn its proposal to acquire Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO).
REDMOND, Wash.  May 3, 2008 
"We continue to believe that our proposed acquisition made sense for Microsoft, Yahoo! and the market as a whole. Our goal in pursuing a combination with Yahoo! was to provide greater choice and innovation in the marketplace and create real value for our respective stockholders and employees," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer of Microsoft.
"Despite our best efforts, including raising our bid by roughly $5 billion, Yahoo! has not moved toward accepting our offer. After careful consideration, we believe the economics demanded by Yahoo! do not make sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our proposal," said Ballmer.
"We have a talented team in place and a compelling plan to grow our business through innovative new services and strategic transactions with other business partners. While Yahoo! would have accelerated our strategy, I am confident that we can continue to move forward toward our goals," Ballmer said.
"We are investing heavily in new tools and Web experiences, we have dramatically improved our search performance and advertiser satisfaction, and we will continue to build our scale through organic growth and partnerships," said Kevin Johnson, Microsoft president for platforms and services.
Below is the text of the letter from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to Yahoo! CEO Jerry Yang.
May 3, 2008
Mr. Jerry Yang
CEO and Chief Yahoo
Yahoo! Inc.
701 First Avenue
Sunnyvale, CA 94089
Dear Jerry:
After over three months, we have reached the conclusion of the process regarding a possible combination of Microsoft and Yahoo!.
I first want to convey my personal thanks to you, your management team, and Yahoo!'s Board of Directors for your consideration of our proposal. I appreciate the time and attention all of you have given to this matter, and I especially appreciate the time that you have invested personally. I feel that our discussions this week have been particularly useful, providing me for the first time with real clarity on what is and is not possible.
I am disappointed that Yahoo! has not moved towards accepting our offer. I first called you with our offer on January 31 because I believed that a combination of our two companies would have created real value for our respective shareholders and would have provided consumers, publishers, and advertisers with greater innovation and choice in the marketplace. Our decision to offer a 62 percent premium at that time reflected the strength of these convictions.
In our conversations this week, we conveyed our willingness to raise our offer to $33.00 per share, reflecting again our belief in this collective opportunity. This increase would have added approximately another $5 billion of value to your shareholders, compared to the current value of our initial offer. It also would have reflected a premium of over 70 percent compared to the price at which your stock closed on January 31. Yet it has proven insufficient, as your final position insisted on Microsoft paying yet another $5 billion or more, or at least another $4 per share above our $33.00 offer.
Also, after giving this week's conversations further thought, it is clear to me that it is not sensible for Microsoft to take our offer directly to your shareholders. This approach would necessarily involve a protracted proxy contest and eventually an exchange offer. Our discussions with you have led us to conclude that, in the interim, you would take steps that would make Yahoo! undesirable as an acquisition for Microsoft.
We regard with particular concern your apparent planning to respond to a "hostile" bid by pursuing a new arrangement that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo! today. In our view, such an arrangement with the dominant search provider would make an acquisition of Yahoo! undesirable to us for a number of reasons:
 
 
 
 
Accordingly, your apparent plan to pursue such an arrangement in the event of a proxy contest or exchange offer leads me to the firm decision not to pursue such a path. Instead, I hereby formally withdraw Microsoft's proposal to acquire Yahoo!.
We will move forward and will continue to innovate and grow our business at Microsoft with the talented team we have in place and potentially through strategic transactions with other business partners.
I still believe even today that our offer remains the only alternative put forward that provides your stockholders full and fair value for their shares. By failing to reach an agreement with us, you and your stockholders have left significant value on the table.
But clearly a deal is not to be.
Thank you again for the time we have spent together discussing this.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $15.84 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, 2008, an 18% increase over the same period of the prior year. Operating income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $5.68 billion and $0.46, representing growth of 42% and 48%, respectively, over the same period of the prior year.
REDMOND, Wash.  July 17, 2008 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008, Microsoft announced revenue of $60.42 billion, an 18% increase over the prior year. Operating income and diluted earnings per share for the year were $22.49 billion and $1.87, representing yearly growth of 21% and 32%, respectively.
The growth rates for operating income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of the company's Xbox 360 warranty coverage.
"Delivering $60 billion in annual revenue is an outstanding accomplishment and a testament to the powerful combination of great technology solutions and strong execution by our partners and global sales and marketing teams," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "The outlook for fiscal year 2009 is positive given the breadth of our impressive technology portfolio and the expanding collection of online services we are bringing to market."
This fiscal year marked the launch of Microsoft's flagship server products: Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008. Revenue growth was primarily driven by continued customer demand for all products, including Windows Vista, which has
sold over 180 million licenses since launch, the 2007 Microsoft Office system, server software, and Xbox 360 consoles and games.
"We had a strong finish in the fourth quarter, which capped off an impressive year for the company. We grew revenue 18% for the year with earnings per share significantly outpacing that," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Looking forward, despite difficult economic conditions, we will build upon the momentum exiting fiscal year 2008 and expect to deliver another year of double-digit revenue and earnings growth in fiscal year 2009."
Business Outlook
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending September 30, 2008:

Summary
 
Fourth Quarter
Revenue growth was primarily driven by increased Windows Server and SQL Server revenue, increased licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and Windows Vista, and increased Xbox 360 platform sales. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $542 million or four percentage point increase in revenue during the quarter.
Operating income increased primarily reflecting increased revenue and decreased cost of revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $371 million or 11%, driven by the $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of our Xbox 360 warranty coverage, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 product costs reflecting growth in unit console sales. Headcount-related expenses increased 15% reflecting an increase in headcount during the year.
Full Fiscal Year
Revenue growth was driven primarily by increased licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system, increased Xbox 360 platform sales, increased revenue associated with Windows Server and SQL Server, and increased licensing of Windows Vista. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $1.6 billion or three percentage point increase in revenue during the year.
Operating income increased primarily reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased headcount-related expenses, increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, and increased cost of revenue. Headcount-related expenses increased 12%, reflecting an increase in headcount during the year. We incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during the year primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million) as compared with $511 million of legal charges during the prior year. Cost of revenue increased $905 million or 8%, reflecting increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and increased costs associated with the growth in our consulting services, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 costs. The decreased Xbox 360 costs reflect the $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of our Xbox 360 warranty coverage, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 product costs reflecting growth in unit console sales.
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is presented separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor performance at the segment level during the current period.
Client
 
Client offerings consist of premium edition and standard Windows operating systems. Premium offerings are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard versions. Premium offerings include Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center Edition, and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition. Standard Windows operating systems include Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth generally correlates with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by changes in the mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed ("OEM premium mix"), changes in the geographical mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Fourth Quarter
Client revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of Windows Vista. OEM revenue increased $420 million or 13%, driven by 22% growth in OEM license units. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $138 million or 22%, primarily from Enterprise Agreements and anti-piracy efforts in emerging markets. OEM premium mix was 72% for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, reflecting strong demand for Windows Vista Home Premium. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14%, driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased reflecting increased revenue and decreased cost of revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $48 million or 16%, reflecting lower support services and product costs related to licensing of Windows Vista. Sales and marketing expenses increased $103 million or 22% and research and development expenses increased $46 million or 19%, primarily reflecting a 14% increase in headcount-related expenses and increased investments in consumer marketing campaigns.
Full Fiscal Year
Client revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of Windows Vista. OEM revenue increased $1.7 billion or 13%, driven by 16% growth in OEM license units. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems increased $209 million or 8%, primarily from Enterprise Agreements and anti-piracy efforts in emerging markets. During the year, the OEM premium mix increased seven percentage points to 74%, reflecting strong demand for Windows Vista Home Premium.
Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 12% to 14%, driven by demand in both emerging and mature markets.
Client operating income increased reflecting increased revenue, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses increased $149 million or 10%, primarily reflecting increased expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Cost of revenue increased $115 million or 13%, primarily driven by Windows Vista product costs.
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses ("CAL") for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server products can be run on site, in a hosting environment, or in a web-based environment. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Fourth Quarter
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product and services revenue and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $167 million or five percentage points. Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools revenue increased $474 million or 19%, primarily driven by growth in volume licensing of Windows Server and SQL Server products, reflecting broad adoption of the Windows Platform and applications. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $179 million or 30%, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services in corporate enterprises.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in high-margin product revenue, partially offset by increased cost of revenue, sales and marketing expenses, and research and development expenses. Cost of revenue increased $133 million or 23%, reflecting the growth in Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $78 million or 8%, due to higher expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Research and development expenses increased $46 million or 10%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses. Headcount-related expenses increased 12%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.

Server and server application revenue (including CAL revenue) and developer tools revenue increased $1.4 billion or 15%, primarily driven by growth in volume licensing of Windows Server and SQL Server products. This growth reflects broad adoption of the Windows Platform and applications with the releases of Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 during the fiscal year. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $593 million or 29%, primarily due to higher demand for consulting and support services in corporate enterprises.

Online Services Business
 
Online Services Business ("OSB") consists of an on-line advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, personal communications services such as e-mail and instant messaging, online information offerings such as Live Search, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, home page, and email and messaging services. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, from advertiser and publisher tools, digital marketing and advertising agency services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers. We continue to launch new online offerings and expect to do so in the future. During fiscal year 2008, we launched new releases of Windows Live Search, the Windows Live suite of applications and services, and updated our MSN Video Service. In addition, we launched a new release of adCenter and expanded our advertising platform portfolio.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we completed our acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. ("aQuantive"), a digital marketing business which we expect will play a key role in the development of our advertising business. aQuantive earns revenue from online advertising and from digital marketing and advertising agency services. We believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross-media planning, video-on-demand, and Internet protocol television. aQuantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting August 10, 2007, the acquisition date.
Fourth Quarter
OSB revenue increased driven by increased online advertising revenue and the inclusion of aQuantive revenue, partially offset by decreased access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $93 million or 18%, to $618 million. This increase reflects growth in our existing online advertising business and includes aQuantive online advertising revenue of $33 million. Agency revenue, which is solely derived from aQuantive, was $94 million during the quarter. Access revenue decreased $18 million or 23%, to $59 million, reflecting the migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. As of June 30, 2008, we estimate we had approximately 460 million Windows Live IDs compared with 382 million as of the same period last year.
OSB operating loss increased driven by increased cost of revenue and other operating expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $251 million or 76%, primarily driven by increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and aQuantive-related expenses. Research and development expenses increased $74 million or 28%, sales and marketing expenses increased $69 million or 26%, and general and administrative expenses increased $46 million or 192%, primarily reflecting a 39% increase in headcount-related expenses. The growth in sales and marketing expenses also reflected an increase of $26 million of amortization of customer-related intangible assets while the growth in general and administrative expenses also reflected increased merger and acquisition-related costs.
Full Fiscal Year
OSB revenue increased driven by increased online advertising revenue and the inclusion of aQuantive revenue, partially offset by decreased access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $553 million or 31%, to $2.3 billion. This increase reflects growth in our existing online advertising business and includes aQuantive online advertising revenue of $161 million. Agency revenue, which is solely derived from aQuantive, was $345 million during the year. Access revenue decreased $98 million or 28%, to $256 million, reflecting migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.
OSB operating loss increased driven by increased cost of revenue and other operating expenses, partially offset by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $796 million or 71%, primarily driven by increased data center and equipment costs, online content expenses, and aQuantive-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $300 million or 35%, primarily due to increased amortization of customer-related intangible assets of $94 million, increased headcount-related expenses, and increased marketing costs. Research and development expenses increased $177 million or 18% and general and administrative expenses increased $117 million or 175%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and merger and acquisition-related expenses. Headcount-related expenses increased 24%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.
Microsoft Business Division
 
Microsoft Business Division ("MBD") offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as enterprise content management, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue, and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue. In April 2008, we completed our acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer ASA ("FAST"), an enterprise search company. We believe the acquisition will broaden our enterprise search technology product offerings to businesses and will enable innovations in related areas such as our portal and content management.
Fourth Quarter
MBD revenue increased reflecting growth in licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $266 million or six percentage points. Business revenue increased $696 million or 19% as a result of growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and strong transactional license sales to businesses. The increase in business revenue also included a 22% increase in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Consumer revenue decreased $66 million or 7%, reflecting the consumer launch of the 2007 Microsoft Office system in the prior fiscal year.
MBD operating income increased reflecting growth in revenue, partially offset by increased research and development expenses, cost of revenue, and sales and marketing expenses. Research and development expenses increased $97 million or 28%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and a $35 million in-process research and development expense related to FAST. Cost of revenue increased $87 million or 38%, primarily driven by an increase in online services infrastructure costs and FAST-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $76 million or 7%, reflecting increased expenses associated with our corporate sales force. Headcount-related costs increased 14%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.

Entertainment and Devices Division
 
Entertainment and Devices Division ("EDD") products include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox Live, and Xbox 360 accessories), the Zune digital music and entertainment platform, PC software games, online games and services, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), the Surface computing platform, mobile and embedded device platforms, and other devices. EDD leads the development efforts for our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for Macintosh computers and Microsoft PC hardware products, and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and the Windows operating systems. In April 2008, we acquired Danger, Inc. ("Danger") a software-as-a-service company that provides mobile operators with an integrated end-to-end solution to deliver mobile data and Internet services to their subscribers.
Fourth Quarter
EDD revenue increased primarily due to increased Xbox 360 platform sales. Xbox 360 platform and PC games revenue increased $234 million or 35%, primarily as a result of increased Xbox 360 console sales, Xbox 360 video game sales, and Xbox Live revenue. We shipped 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, compared with 0.7 million Xbox 360 consoles in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.
EDD operating loss decreased primarily due to decreased cost of revenue and increased revenue, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $826 million or 49%, reflecting the $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 related to the expansion of our Xbox 360 warranty coverage, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 product costs related to increased unit console sales. Research and development expenses increased $141 million or 38%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses, increased product development costs, and costs relating to Danger, including a $24 million in-process research and development expense.

Full Fiscal Year
EDD revenue increased primarily due to increased Xbox 360 platform sales. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue increased $1.7 billion or 41% as a result of increased Xbox 360 console sales, video game sales led by Halo 3, Xbox Live revenue, and Xbox 360 accessory sales. We shipped 8.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2008, compared with 6.6 million consoles during fiscal year 2007.
EDD operating income increased primarily due to increased revenue and decreased cost of revenue, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $683 million or 13%, reflecting the $1.1 billion Xbox 360 warranty charge in fiscal year 2007 described above, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 product costs related to increased unit console sales. Research and development expenses increased $242 million or 18%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and costs relating to Danger, including a $24 million in-process research and development expense. Sales and marketing expenses increased $93 million or 8%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and increased bad debt expense. Headcount-related costs increased 21%, driven by an increase in headcount during the year.
Corporate-Level Activity
 
Certain corporate-level activity including expenses related to corporate operations associated with broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and legal settlements and contingencies, is not allocated to our segments. Corporate-level expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2008, reflecting a 10% increase in headcount-related expenses, increased corporate marketing and advertising campaigns, and increased consulting and professional fees. Corporate-level expenses increased during the twelve months ended June 30, 2008, reflecting increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies and a 12% increase in headcount-related expenses. We incurred $1.8 billion of legal charges during the year primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million) as compared with $511 million of legal charges during the prior year. The increase in headcount-related expenses reflects an increase in headcount during the year.
Operating Expenses
Cost of Revenue
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2008, reflecting increased headcount-related expenses and increased corporate marketing and advertising campaigns. Headcount-related
expenses increased 17% during the three months and 14% during the twelve months ended June 30, 2008, reflecting an increase in headcount during the year.
General and Administrative
 
Fourth Quarter
Dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments. Net recognized gains on investments, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $64 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 as compared with $7 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline. Net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net gains on commodity derivatives.
Full Fiscal Year
Dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest-bearing investments. Net recognized gains on investments, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $312 million during fiscal year 2008 and $25 million during fiscal year 2007, decreased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of the recent stock market decline. Net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to higher net gains on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives. Other of $138 million includes the correction of several immaterial items from prior periods.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Income Taxes
The effective tax rate was 28% and 29% for the three months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decreased rate reflects a higher mix of earnings in low rate tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate was 26% and 30% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decreased rate resulted from resolution of tax positions related to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for the 2000-2003 examination. This decline was partially offset by the tax effect of the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million), which was not tax deductible. As a result of our agreement related to the 2000-2003 examination, we expect to pay the IRS approximately $3.1 billion during fiscal year 2009 in addition to amounts we otherwise would pay.
Financial Condition
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $23.7 billion and $23.4 billion as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Equity and other investments were $6.6 billion and $10.1 billion as of June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominately in U.S.-dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify financial risk. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $26.6 billion at June 30, 2008. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions. This pricing methodology applies to exchange-traded mutual funds, domestic and international equities, U.S. treasuries, and agency securities. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to price positions are not available, then we use inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly, predominately based on prices received from third-party vendors. Assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
While we own certain mortgage and asset-backed fixed-income securities, our portfolio as of June 30, 2008, does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from sub-prime collateral. The majority of the mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a 100% principal and interest guarantee, primarily from Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and Government National Mortgage Association. The remainder of the mortgage position is collateralized by high quality international prime residential mortgage loans.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements, revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP and prior versions, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the life cycle of the related product. Other unearned revenue includes services, Microsoft Dynamics business solution products, Xbox Live subscriptions, advertising, and Mediaroom for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2008:
 
Cash Flows
Fourth Quarter
Cash flow from operations decreased $317 million, primarily due to the $1.4 billion (899 million) payment of the European Commission fine, partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers driven by 18% revenue growth. Cash used for financing decreased $1.9 billion, primarily due to a $2.9 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $919 million decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used for investing was $503 million in the three months ended June 30, 2008 as compared with cash provided of $1.1 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2007. This decrease was primarily driven by a $1.4 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies and a $398 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.
Full Fiscal Year
Cash flow from operations increased $3.8 billion due to an increase in cash received from customers driven by 18% revenue growth, partially offset by the $1.4 billion (899 million) payment of the European Commission fine. Cash used for financing decreased $11.6 billion, primarily due to a $15.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by a $3.3 billion decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Cash used for investing was $4.6 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 as compared with cash provided of $6.1 billion for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a $6.9 billion increase in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aQuantive in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a $918 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, and a $3.1 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities.

The Compensation Committee of the Microsoft Corporation ("Company") Board of Directors has approved a new executive officer incentive plan ("Plan") for the Company's executive officers. The Plan replaces the existing annual cash bonus and equity award programs for the Company's executive officers beginning with fiscal year 2009.
The Plan allows the Compensation Committee to establish award programs for specified performance periods (e.g., one or more fiscal years). The maximum amount payable to a participating executive officer is a percentage of an incentive pool for a performance period. For fiscal year 2009, awards will be granted from an incentive pool with maximum funding of 0.35% of Microsoft's fiscal year 2009 corporate operating income. The awards granted to each participating executive officer will be limited to a fixed share of the incentive pool, and these awards may be further reduced or eliminated in the discretion of the Compensation Committee (or in the discretion of the Board of directors, for awards to the Company's chief executive officer, Steven A. Ballmer). The Plan specifies a maximum amount of $20,000,000 that may be paid under the Plan to a participating executive officer for one or more performance periods that end during a fiscal year. Award amounts under the Plan may be made in either or both stock awards issued under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan and cash. Vesting of stock awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee. The 2001 Stock Plan generally requires that stock awards vest over at least a three-year period.
 
Effective September 19, 2008, the Board of Directors amended the Company's bylaws. A copy of the amended bylaws is attached Exhibit 3.2. The amendments relate primarily to the requirements for advance notice and additional information that a shareholder must provide when making a director nomination or proposal at the Company's annual meeting of shareholders.

Written or electronic notice of each shareholders' meeting stating the date, time, and place and, for a special meeting, the purpose(s) for which the meeting is called, shall be given by the Corporation not less than ten (10) (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record, to the shareholder's address as it appears on the current record of shareholders of the Corporation.
1.5 Notice
. At any meeting of the shareholders, a majority in interest of all the shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented by shareholders of record in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.
1.6 Quorum of Shareholders
Once a share is represented at a meeting, other than to object to holding the meeting or transacting business, it is deemed to be present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment to a new date, time, or place unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.
If a quorum exists, action on a matter is approved by a voting group if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the Washington Business Corporation Act, as amended ("WBCA"), or of the Articles of Incorporation or of these Bylaws a different vote is required.
. A majority of the shares represented at the meeting, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time. At a reconvened meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted at the meeting as may have been brought at the adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 1.3. If a meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if a new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment; however, if the WBCA requires that a new record date for the adjourned meeting must be fixed, then notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.
1.7 Adjournment
. For the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for any such determination of shareholders, which date shall not be more than seventy (70) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken.
1.8 Record Date and Transfer Books
If no record date is fixed for such purposes, the date on which notice of the meeting is given or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders.
When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date is fixed for the original meeting.
. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make at least ten (10) days before each meeting of shareholders a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged by any applicable voting groups and in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder. The record of shareholders shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder or any shareholder's agent during the whole time of the meeting.
1.9 Voting Record
 
Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 2
. Shareholders of record may vote at any meeting either in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote for the shareholder by submitting (a) an appointment form signed by the shareholder or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact, or (b) an electronic transmission sent in accordance with the provisions for electronic notice under Section 3.3. An appointment of proxy is effective when an appointment form or an electronic transmission (or documentary evidence thereof, including verification information) is received by the person authorized to tabulate votes for the Corporation. The proxy has the same power to vote as that possessed by the shareholder, unless the appointment form or electronic transmission contains an express limitation on the power to vote or direction as to how to vote the shares on a particular matter, in which event the Corporation must tabulate the votes in a manner consistent with that limitation or direction. An appointment of proxy is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form or electronic transmission.
1.10 Proxies
. The officer designated by the Chief Executive Officer (or in the absence of a designation by the Chief Executive Officer, any other officer designated by the Board of Directors) may call any meeting of shareholders to order and shall be the Chairman of the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present at any meeting of its shareholders, shall act as the Secretary of the meeting. If the Secretary is absent from any meeting of shareholders, the Chairman of the meeting may appoint a Secretary for the meeting.
1.11 Organization of Meeting
. The Chairman of a meeting of shareholders, determined in accordance with Section 1.11, shall have discretion to establish the order of business for the meeting subject to any specific order established by the Board of Directors.
1.12 Order of Business
In order for a Noticing Shareholder to properly bring any item of business before an annual meeting of shareholders, the Noticing Shareholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in compliance with the requirements of this Section 1.13. This Section 1.13 shall constitute an "advance notice provision" for annual meetings for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.
1.13 Notice of Shareholder Business to be Conducted at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
(a) To be timely, a Noticing Shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation: not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.

(F) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by the Holder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation,

(v) With respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, the Noticing Shareholder shall include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation, and agreement required by Section 1.14. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of the nominee.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.13(a) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by these Bylaws shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the public announcement naming all nominees or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors is first made by the Corporation.
(d) For purposes of these Bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(e) Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in compliance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these Bylaws, a Noticing Shareholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in these Bylaws; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to Section 1.3 or Section 1.13.
(g) Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Notice of shareholder proposals that are, or that the Noticing Shareholder intends to be, governed by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act are not governed by these Bylaws.
 
Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 6

(ii) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the person's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with the person's fiduciary duties under applicable law,
(b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement, or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein, and
(c) in the person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation.
The shareholders may amend or repeal these Bylaws, or adopt new bylaws, even though the Bylaws also may be amended or repealed, or new bylaws also may be adopted, by the Board of Directors, by action taken in the manner provided by the WBCA and the Articles of Incorporation.
1.15 Bylaw Amendments.
. The business affairs and property of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of not less than three directors nor more than eleven directors. The number of directors may at any time be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the shareholders at the annual meeting. Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Washington.
2.1 Number and Qualifications
. At each annual shareholders' meeting the shareholders shall elect the directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, the directors shall not have been elected at any annual meeting, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
2.2 Election - Term of Office
 
Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 7
Except as provided in Section 2.10 and in this paragraph, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director. The following shall not be votes cast: (a) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (c) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In a contested election, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.
A contested election is one in which (a) on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 1.13(a), a Noticing Shareholder has complied with the requirements of Section 1.13 with respect to one or more nominees; and (b) prior to the date that notice of the meeting is given, the board of directors has not made a determination that none of the candidacies of the Noticing Shareholder's nominees creates a bona fide election contest. For purposes of these Bylaws, it is assumed that on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 1.13(a), there is a candidate nominated by the board of directors for each of the director positions to be voted on at the meeting. The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not receive a majority vote shall not be elected. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote shall continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of (a) 90 days after the date on which an inspector determines the voting results as to that director pursuant to RCW 23B.07.290; (b) the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by such director, which appointment shall constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.10; or (c) the date of the director's resignation. Any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director under this Section 2.2 may be filled by the Board of Directors as provided in Section 2.10. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee failing to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation and within ninety (90) days after the certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. Except as provided in the next sentence, no director who failed to receive a majority vote for election will participate in the Governance and Nominating Committee recommendation or Board of Directors decision about filling his or her office. If no director receives a majority vote in an uncontested election, then the incumbent directors (a) will nominate a slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees as soon as practicable, and (b) may in the interim fill one or more offices with the same director(s) who will continue in office until their successors are elected.
. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such places, and at such times as the Board may determine, and, if so determined, no notice thereof need be given. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders at the same place at which such meeting was held.
2.3 Regular Meetings
. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place upon the call of a majority of directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer.
2.4 Special Meetings
 
Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 8
. No notice is required for regular meetings of the Board of Directors. Notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors, stating the date, time, and place thereof, shall be given in a manner described in Section 3.3 at least two (2) days prior to the date of the meeting. The purpose of the meeting need not be given in the notice.
2.5 Notice
. A director may waive notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors either before or after the meeting, and the waiver shall be deemed to be the equivalent of giving notice. The waiver must be given in accordance with the requirements for written or electronic notice in Section 3.3. Attendance or participation of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver of notice of that meeting unless the director attends or participates for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of business because the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened.
2.6 Waiver of Notice
. A majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but if at any meeting of the Board there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the members present shall decide any question brought before such meeting, except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.
2.7 Quorum of Directors
. A majority of the directors present, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn a meeting and continue it to a later time. Notice of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat, other than by announcement, shall not be necessary. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which could have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
2.8 Adjournment
. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary of the Corporation. Any director resignation is effective when the notice is delivered, unless the notice specifies a later effective date.
2.9 Resignation
. Unless otherwise provided by the WBCA, in case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors or non-election of a director pursuant to Section 2.2, the remaining directors, whether constituting a quorum or not, may fill the vacancy.
2.10 Vacancies
. The Board of Directors shall have the sole authority to fix the amount of compensation of directors.
2.11 Compensation
. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board, may designate from among its members one or more committees, each of which:
2.12 Committees
(a) Shall have two (2) or more members;
(b) Shall be governed by the same rules regarding meetings, action without meetings, notice, and waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements as are applied to the Board; and
(c) To the extent provided in the resolution, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the Board, except no such committee shall have the authority to:
(i) Authorize or approve a distribution except according to a general formula or method prescribed by the Board;
 
Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 9
(ii) Approve or propose to shareholders action which the WBCA requires to be approved by shareholders;

. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board may be accomplished without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members of the Board or all the members of the committee, as the case may be. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action to be taken, given by all directors or all members of the committee, as the case may be, to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes in a manner equivalent to written or electronic notice under Section 3.3. Directors' consents may be given either before or after the action taken.
3.1 Action by Unanimous Consent
Action taken by unanimous consent is effective when the last director consents to the action, unless the consent specifies a later effective date.
. Meetings of the shareholders, the Board of Directors, and committees of the Board may be effectuated by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
3.2 Use of Communications Equipment
. Terms used in this Bylaw shall be as defined in the WBCA.
3.3 Oral, Written and Electronic Notice
Oral notice may be communicated in person or by telephone, wire, or wireless equipment that does not transmit a facsimile of the notice. Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.
Written notice may be transmitted by mail, private carrier, or personal delivery; or telephone, wire, or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice and provides the transmitter with an electronically generated receipt. Written notice is effective at the earliest of the following: (a) when received; (b) five (5) days after its deposit in the U.S. mail if mailed with first-class postage to the address as it appears on the current records of the Corporation; (c) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee. Written notice to a shareholder is effective (a) when mailed, if mailed with first class postage prepaid; and (b) when dispatched, if prepaid, by air courier.
 
Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 10
Notices to directors and shareholders from the Corporation and from directors and shareholders to the Corporation may be provided in an electronic transmission which contains or is accompanied by information from which it can be reasonably verified that the transmission was authorized by the director, the shareholder, or by the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. Subject to contrary provisions in the WBCA, notice to shareholders or directors in an electronic transmission shall be effective only with respect to shareholders and directors that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and that have designated in the consent the address, location, or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted and with respect to a notice that otherwise complies with any other requirements of the WBCA and any applicable federal law. A shareholder or director who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the Corporation in the form of a record. The consent of any shareholder or director is revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with the consent, and (b) this inability becomes known to the Secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the Corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
. The officers of the Corporation may consist of a Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer, one or more Presidents, one or more Vice Presidents (who may be designated as Corporate Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, Executive Vice Presidents or Group Vice Presidents), a Secretary, and a Treasurer as appointed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. The Corporation may have such additional or assistant officers (sometimes referred to as "additional officers") as the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, or Chief Operating Officer may deem necessary for its business and may appoint from time to time. The Board of Directors shall also have the authority, but shall not be required, to designate officers as the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or similar such titles. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person.
4.1 Positions
If a director/officer has not been designated as Chairman, or if the designated Chairman is not present at a meeting, the Board of Directors shall elect a Chairman from amongst its members to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors for such meeting. The Chairman shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors, and shall have such other powers as the Board may determine.
. The officers of the Corporation shall be appointed annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board held after each annual meeting of the shareholders. If officers are not appointed at such meeting, such appointment shall occur as soon as possible thereafter, or may be left vacant. Each officer shall hold office until a successor shall have been appointed and qualified or until said officer's earlier death, resignation, or removal.
4.2 Appointment and Term of Office
. The Chief Executive Officer shall have general charge and supervision of the business of the Corporation, shall see that all orders, actions and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried out, and shall have such other authority and shall perform such other duties as set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the Bylaws, such other authorities and duties as prescribed by the Board.

Bylaws of Microsoft CorporationPage 11

Each officer other than the Chief Executive Officer shall have the authority and shall perform the duties set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the Bylaws, the duties prescribed by the Board of Directors, by the Chief Executive Officer, or by an officer authorized by the Board to prescribe the duties of such officer. Any designation of duties by the Chief Executive Officer or other officer shall be subject to review by the Board of Directors but shall be in full force and effect in the absence of such review.
4.4 Authority and Duties of Other Officers
. The Board of Directors shall have authority (a) to fix the compensation, whether in the form of salary, bonus, stock options or otherwise, of all officers and employees of the Corporation, either specifically or by formula applicable to particular classes of officers or employees, and (b) to authorize officers of the Corporation to fix the compensation of subordinate employees. The Board of Directors shall have authority to appoint a Compensation Committee and may delegate to that committee any or all of its authority relating to compensation. The appointment of an officer shall not of itself create contract rights.
4.5 Compensation and Contract Rights
. Any officer of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving notice to the Board of Directors or the Corporation. Any such resignation is effective when the notice is given, unless the notice specifies a later date, and shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the officer.
4.6 Resignation or Removal
The Board of Directors, by majority vote of the entire Board, may remove any officer or agent, with or without cause. An officer or assistant officer, if appointed by another officer, also may be removed by any officer authorized to appoint officers or assistant officers. The removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the person so removed.
. If any office becomes vacant by any reason, the directors may (a) appoint a successor or successors who shall hold office for the unexpired term (b) or leave such office vacant.
4.7 Vacancies
. No shares of the Corporation shall be issued unless authorized by the Board of Directors. Such authorization shall include the maximum number of shares to be issued, the consideration to be received, and a statement that the Board of Directors considers the consideration to be adequate. Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Certificates for shares of the Corporation shall be in such form as is consistent with the provisions of the WBCA or the law of a predecessor corporation and after the effective date of these Bylaws shall state:

(a) The name of the Corporation and that the Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Washington;

. The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as the Board may deem proper or expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of shares of stock. In case of the loss, mutilation, or destruction of a certificate of stock, a duplicate certificate may be issued upon such terms as the Board of Directors shall authorize. The Board of Directors shall have power and authority to appoint from time to time one or more transfer agents and registrar of the shares of stock.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $15.06 billion for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, 2008, a 9% increase over the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $6.00 billion, $4.37 billion and $0.48, respectively.
REDMOND, Wash.Oct. 23, 2008
Microsoft showed particular strength in multiyear annuity sales, which grew more than 20% during the quarter from the combined businesses of Client, Microsoft Business Division and Server and Tools.
"Our customers are asking how they can save money and do more with less," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help our customers save money through supplier consolidation, increased productivity, and a low total cost of ownership through the depth and breadth of our product portfolio and solutions."
Microsoft continued to add to its product and services portfolio with innovative offerings such as Microsoft SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 and the first service update to Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online.
"In a challenging economic environment, the first-quarter results exhibit the strength and diversity of our business model," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer of Microsoft.
Business Outlook
Microsoft's business outlook reflects a balance of risks and the likelihood of a continued economic slowdown. The trends seen late in the first-quarter are now forecasted to continue, whereas previous expectations were for the economy to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. In this economic environment, the company is focused on three main
actions; working with customers to provide high value products at the lowest total overall cost of ownership, increasing focus on expense management and targeting investment into the highest priority strategic opportunities.
Microsoft management offers the following guidance for the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2008:
 
 
 
Management offers the following guidance for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2009:
 
 
 
Liddell noted that "we feel extremely good about our relative competitive position and our ability to continue outgrowing IT spend. We believe our exceptionally strong cash flow, product pipeline and financial strength will allow us to weather economic conditions well."

Microsoft Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K for the purpose of providing additional information regarding a previously announced change in the Company's presentation of gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements and in conjunction with the Registration Statement on Form S-3 that the Company is filing on the date hereof to register debt securities that the Company may offer from time to time. As disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, effective July 1, 2008, the Company began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income, net. Prior to that date, the Company included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. The Company changed its presentation because the modified presentation better reflects how it manages its foreign currency exposures, and as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to its operations.
In connection with the change in the Company's presentation of gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements, we are providing recast financial information previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008. This information (attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, and 99.3) includes selected updated information from certain parts of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 that were impacted by the presentation change, including:
 
 
 
The following gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income, net in the attached exhibits: fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 - $221 million gain; fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 - $86 million gain; fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 - $92 million gain; fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 - $15 million loss; and fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 - $74 million loss.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments in which we exercise significant influence but do not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates of loss contingencies, product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns; estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions.
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI").
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. We enter into certain arrangements where we are obligated to deliver multiple products and/or services (multiple elements). In these arrangements, we generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based on the sales price of each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).
Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally is recognized as products are shipped. A portion of the revenue related to certain products, which include all Windows XP and previous PC operating systems, is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including, in some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, is recorded as unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded as unearned for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to delivered elements. Unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. Revenue related to Windows Vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements.
Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights to receive future versions of software product on a when-and-if-available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (Software Assurance). In addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive future versions of software products on a when-and-if-available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. Premier support services agreements, MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Xbox Live, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for as subscriptions.
 
Revenue related to our Xbox game console and other hardware components is recognized upon shipment of the product to retailers. Revenue related to games published by us is recognized when those games have been delivered to retailers. Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers. Online advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are provided.
Revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Costs related to insignificant obligations, including bug fixes and technical support, are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, warranties, and bad debts.
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory write-downs, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility.
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.2 billion in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
We provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranty, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), . Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method.
Share-Based Payment
 
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, plus the provision for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently invested. Certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes.
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair value of these investments approximates their carrying value. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification method. Changes in market value are reflected in OCI (excluding other-than-temporary impairments).
Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method. Changes in market value are reflected in OCI (excluding other-than-temporary impairments). All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.
We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to enhance investment income. The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet. Collateral and/or security interest received is determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency, equity price, interest rate and credit risks, to enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash-flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. For options designated either as fair-value or cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are recognized in earnings.
 Certain assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Options are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, . Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair-value hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133 are also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies and to manage other foreign currency exposures.
Foreign Currency Risk.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
 Equity investments are subject to market price risk. From time to time, we use and designate options to hedge fair values on certain equity securities. We determine the security selected for hedging by evaluating market conditions, up-front costs, and other relevant factors. Certain options, futures, and swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are also used to manage equity exposures.
Equities Price Risk.
 Fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk. We use exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, to hedge interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Risk.
 Swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, are used to manage exposures to credit risks, enhance returns, and to facilitate portfolio diversification. In addition, we may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other companies as a strategic investment. Warrants that can be net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging instruments. "To Be Announced" forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. All derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, with changes in value recognized in earnings during the period of change.
Other Derivatives.
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis.
Property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term, ranging from one to 15 years. Computer software developed or obtained for internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years or less.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of July 1, and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair-value-based approach. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented.
 
Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to ten years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization. No material impairments of intangible assets have been identified during any of the periods presented.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), , which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Note 11  Income Taxes.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109
On July 1, 2007, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 06-2 ("EITF 06-2"), . EITF 06-2 requires companies to accrue the costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement over the requisite service period. Upon adoption, we recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.
Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, , which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for those instruments under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of those instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 161 may have on our financial statements.
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FAS 133
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, , which replaces SFAS No 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date.
Business Combinations
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent's equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2009 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retrospectively. We are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of SFAS No. 160 may have on our financial statements.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB 51,
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, . SFAS No. 159 gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008. We do not believe SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, , which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). SFAS No. 157 is effective for us beginning July 1, 2008; FSP 157-2 delays the effective date for certain items to July 1, 2009. We do not believe SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157,
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:
(In millions, except earnings per share)
 
For the years ended June 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, 91 million, 199 million, and 649 million shares, respectively, were attributable to outstanding stock options and were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than or equal to the average price of the common shares, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
For the year ended June 30, 2007, four million shared performance stock awards, out of the 14 million targeted amount outstanding, were excluded from the calculation of the diluted earnings per share because the number of shares ultimately issued was contingent on our performance against metrics established for the performance period, as discussed in Note 18  Employee Stock and Savings Plans.
 
The components of other income, net were as follows:
(In millions)
 
Net gains on investments included other-than-temporary impairments of $312 million, $25 million, and $408 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) were $751 million and $93 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2008, $851 million and $176 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2007, and $1.1 billion and $531 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2006.
 
The components of investments, including associated derivatives, were as follows:
 
 
Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:
 
At June 30, 2008, unrealized losses of $255 million consisted of: $121 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $21 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $99 million related to domestic equity securities, and $14 million related to international equity securities. At June 30, 2007, unrealized losses of $186 million consisted of: $161 million related to investment grade fixed-income securities, $7 million related to investments in high yield and emerging market fixed-income securities, $7 million related to domestic equity securities, and $11 million related to international equity securities. Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on our evaluation of available evidence as of June 30, 2008.
Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2008, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $289 million. At June 30, 2007, the recorded basis and estimated fair value of these investments was $38 million. The estimate of fair value is based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management.
 
The maturities of debt securities, including fixed-maturity securities, at June 30, 2008, were as follows:
 
For derivative instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in accordance with SFAS No. 133, did not have a significant impact on earnings for fiscal years 2008, 2007, or 2006. During fiscal year 2008, $274 million in gains on fair-value hedges from changes in time value and $324 million in losses on cash-flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2007, $219 million in gains on fair-value hedges from changes in time value and $361 million in losses on cash-flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were included in investment income and other. During fiscal year 2006, $217 million in gains on fair-value hedges from changes in time value and $399 million in losses on cash-flow hedges from changes in time value were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and were included in investment income and other.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an underlying investment is recognized. During fiscal year 2008, $104 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue. During fiscal year 2007, $168 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue. During fiscal year 2006, $166 million of derivative gains were reclassified to revenue and $23 million in derivative gains were reclassified to investment income and other.
We estimate that $111 million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. No significant amounts of gains or losses were reclassified from OCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006.
Derivative fair values are based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market data. The fair values of all derivative positions were as follows:

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives for buildings range from five to 15 years, leasehold improvements generally range from two to ten years  representing the applicable lease terms plus reasonably assured extensions, computer equipment and software range from two to three years, and furniture and equipment range from one to five years. Land is not depreciated.
During fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, depreciation expense was $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion, and $863 million, respectively. The majority of depreciation expense in all years related to computer equipment.
On August 10, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of aQuantive, Inc. ("aQuantive") for $5.9 billion, which was paid primarily in cash. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, aQuantive is a digital marketing business that we expect will play a key role in the future development of our Online Services Business. We also believe the acquisition will help us build and support next-generation advertiser and publisher solutions in environments such as cross media planning, video-on-demand, and Internet protocol television. aQuantive was consolidated into our results of operations starting August 10, 2007, the acquisition date.
As a result of the aQuantive acquisition, we recorded $5.2 billion of goodwill in our Online Services Business. Of the $939 million of acquired intangible assets, $24 million was assigned to in-process research and development assets and was expensed. The remaining acquired intangible assets include $476 million of customer relationships with a weighted average life of six years, $327 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted average life of four years, and $112 million of other intangible assets with a weighted average life of five years.
On April 24, 2008, we acquired all the outstanding shares of Fast Search & Transfer ASA ("FAST") for $1.3 billion, which was paid primarily in cash. Headquartered in Oslo, Norway, FAST is an enterprise search company that we expect will broaden our enterprise search technology product offerings to businesses and will enable innovation in related areas such as our portal and content management. FAST was consolidated into our results of operations starting April 24, 2008, the acquisition date.
 
As a result of the FAST acquisition, we recorded $981 million of goodwill in our Microsoft Business Division. Of the $266 million of acquired intangible assets, $35 million was assigned to in-process research and development assets and was expensed. The remaining acquired intangible assets include $27 million of customer relationships with a weighted average life of seven years, $134 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted average life of five years, and $70 million of other intangible assets with a weighted average life of six years.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of the aQuantive and FAST acquisitions:
 
In addition to aQuantive and FAST, we acquired 19 other entities during fiscal year 2008 for total consideration of $1.6 billion which was paid primarily in cash and included:
 
 
As a result of our acquisition of Danger and the 18 other entities, we recorded $1.2 billion of goodwill. In addition, $37 million was assigned to in-process research and development assets and was expensed. All of the entities have been consolidated into our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The purchase price allocations for these acquisitions are preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available. Any change in the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of Danger and the 18 other acquisitions, individually and in aggregate, were not material.
 
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 by segment were as follows:
(In millions)
 
We test goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 at the reporting unit level using a fair value approach, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, . Our annual testing resulted in no impairments of goodwill in fiscal years 2008 and 2007. If an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value, goodwill will be evaluated for impairment between annual tests.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
None of the amount recorded as goodwill during fiscal year 2008 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation for acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition date and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about fair value of assets and liabilities become available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of the acquired company will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Purchase price adjustments are included in "other" in the above table.
The components of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:
(In millions)
 
 
During fiscal year 2008 and 2007, we recorded additions to intangible assets of $1.6 billion and $473 million, respectively. We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible assets. The components of finite-lived intangible assets acquired during fiscal years 2008 and 2007 were as follows:
(In millions)
 
Intangible asset additions included $694 million of technology-based intangible assets with a weighted-average life of four years, and $782 million of other intangible assets with a weighted-average life of six years, related to the acquisitions of aQuantive, FAST, Danger, and 18 other entities acquired. See Note 8 - Acquisitions.
Acquired intangibles generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over weighted average lives. Intangible assets amortization expense was $472 million for fiscal year 2008, $236 million for fiscal year 2007, and $127 million for fiscal year 2006. The following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets as of June 30, 2008:

The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows:
 
In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and research credits. In fiscal years 2008 and 2006, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. Other reconciling items in fiscal year 2007 included the impact of a $195 million reduction resulting from various changes in tax positions taken in prior periods, related primarily to favorable developments in an IRS position and multiple foreign audit assessments.
The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
(In millions)
 
 
(In millions)
 
Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.
We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $7.5 billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U.S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the United States. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences is approximately $2.2 billion.
Income taxes paid were $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2008, $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2007, and $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2006.
FIN 48
On July 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48 which had the following impact on our financial statements: increased current assets by $228 million, long-term assets by $1.1 billion, long-term liabilities by $2.1 billion, and retained deficit by $395 million; and decreased income taxes payable by $394 million. As of June 30, 2008, we had $3.2 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of July 1, 2007, we had $7.1 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Interest totaled $121 million in fiscal year 2008. As of June 30, 2008 and July 1, 2007, we had accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $324 million and $863 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits, on our balance sheets.
The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:
(In millions)
 
During fiscal year 2008, we reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") on its 2000-2003 examination. As a result, we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $4.8 billion and recognized a tax provision reduction of $1.2 billion. We are under audit by the IRS for the tax years 2004-2006. We do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded within the next 12 months. As a result of our settlement related to the 2000-2003 examination, we paid the IRS approximately $3.1 billion during the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the United States, none of which are individually material to our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
 
Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:
 Represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.
Volume licensing programs
 Represents free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis. This revenue deferral is applicable for Windows XP and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to OEMs, and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home and approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems.
Undelivered elements
 Represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.

We have committed $1.2 billion for constructing new buildings as of June 30, 2008.
We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $398 million, $325 million, and $271 million, in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases are as follows:
 
We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. In addition, we also provide indemnification against credit risk in several geographical locations to our volume license resellers in case the resellers fail to collect from the end user. Due to the nature of the indemnification provided to our resellers, we cannot estimate the fair value, nor determine the total nominal amount, of the indemnification. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, , as interpreted by FIN No. 45, . We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial statements.

Product Warranty
In July 2007, we announced the expansion of our global Xbox 360 warranty coverage to three years from the date of purchase for a general hardware failure indicated by three flashing red lights. The basic Xbox 360 console warranty remains in place with a warranty period of one year from the date of purchase in most geographies.
The changes in our aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance sheets, were as follows:

Accruals for warranties issued during fiscal year 2007 included charges incurred as a result of the expansion of our Xbox 360 warranty coverage as discussed above.
 
 In March 2004, the European Commission issued a competition law decision that, among other things, ordered us to license certain Windows server protocol technology to our competitors. In March 2007, the European Commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required by the March 2004 decision were "not reasonable." Following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the Commission announced on October 22, 2007 that we were in compliance with the March 2004 decision and that no further penalty should accrue after that date. On February 27, 2008, the Commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion (899 million) relating to the period prior to October 22, 2007. In January 2008, the Commission announced that it was opening two new competition law investigations. These investigations relate primarily to interoperability with respect to our Microsoft Office family of products and the inclusion of various capabilities in our Windows operating system software, including Web browsing software. These investigations were precipitated by complaints filed with the Commission by a trade association of Microsoft's competitors and a firm that offers Web browsing software. In May 2008, we filed an application with the European Court of First Instance to annul the February 2008 fine. We paid the $1.4 billion (899 million) fine in June 2008.
Government competition law matters.
We are subject to a Consent Decree and Final Judgment that resolved lawsuits brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, 18 states, and the District of Columbia in two separate actions. The Consent Decree imposed various constraints on our Windows operating system businesses. Portions of the Consent Decree were scheduled to expire on January 31, 2008; we voluntarily agreed to extend other elements of the Consent Decree to November 2009. In October 2007, some states filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to have most of the remaining provisions of the Final Judgment in the action to which they are party extended for five years. The U.S. Department of Justice and other states advised the Court that they would not seek any extension of the Final Judgments to which they are party. In January 2008, the court issued a decision granting the states' motion to extend these additional provisions of the consent decree until November 2009.
In other ongoing investigations, various foreign governments and several state attorneys general have requested information from us concerning competition, privacy, and security issues.
 A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits have been filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and certain other software products. We obtained dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal law and in 15 states. Courts refused to certify classes in two additional states. We have reached agreements to settle all claims that have been made to date in 19 states and the District of Columbia.
Antitrust, unfair competition, and overcharge class actions.
Under the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers.
The settlements in all states have received final court approval. Cases in Arizona, Mississippi and Canada have not been settled. We estimate the total cost to resolve all of these cases will range between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. The actual cost depends on factors such as the quantity and mix of products for which claims will be made, the number of eligible class members who ultimately use the vouchers, the nature of hardware and software that is acquired using the vouchers, and the cost of administering the claims. At June 30, 2008, we have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately $900 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.7 billion less payments made to date of approximately $800 million, mostly for administrative expenses, vouchers, and legal fees.
 In November 2004, Novell, Inc. filed a complaint in U.S. District Court in Utah, now transferred with other cases to Maryland, asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell's ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. In June 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. Both parties appealed, and in October 2007, the court of appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court, remanding the case to that court for further proceedings.
Other antitrust litigation and claims.
 
 We are vigorously defending more than 45 patent infringement cases. Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent are parties to a number of legal proceedings relating to certain patents of each of the companies. Some of these actions began before the merger of Alcatel and Lucent in 2006. For simplicity, we refer to the post-merger entity as Alcatel-Lucent throughout this discussion.
Patent and intellectual property claims.
 
 
 
 
 
The actual costs to resolve these cases will depend upon many factors such as the outcome of post-trial motions, any appeals, and the results of the remaining trials. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the matters described in this section may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that would adversely affect distribution of our operating system or application products. We may enter into material settlements because of these risks.
 We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
Other.
As of June 30, 2008, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $600 million in other current liabilities and approximately $500 million in other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters described in this note. While we intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could be up to $2.2 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

On July 20, 2006, we announced the completion of the repurchase program initially approved by our Board of Directors on July 20, 2004 to buy back up to $30.0 billion in Microsoft common stock.
On July 20, 2006, we also announced that our Board of Directors authorized two new share repurchase programs: a $20.0 billion tender offer, which was completed on August 17, 2006; and authorization for up to an additional $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program with an expiration of June 30, 2011. Under the tender offer, we repurchased approximately 155 million shares of common stock, or 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, for approximately $3.8 billion at a price per share of $24.75. On August 18, 2006, we announced that the authorization for the $20.0 billion ongoing share repurchase program had been increased by approximately $16.2 billion. As a result, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to $36.2 billion through June 30, 2011. As of June 30, 2008, approximately $2.7 billion remained of the $36.2 billion approved repurchase amount. Under these repurchase plans, we have made the following share repurchases:

Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares:
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
 
At June 30, 2008, 107 million shares were reserved for future issuance.
 We have a savings plan in the United States that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Participating U.S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant's earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $238 million, $218 million, and $178 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to each participant's voluntary contributions in the investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U.S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock.
Savings Plan.
 We have stock plans for directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors. At June 30, 2008, an aggregate of 786 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises.
Stock Plans.
 Stock awards ("SAs") are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. Our SAs generally vest over a five-year period.
Stock Awards and Shared Performance Stock Awards.
Shared performance stock awards ("SPSAs") are a form of SA in which the number of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against specified performance targets. The performance period for SPSAs issued in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006 was July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006 (January 1, 2004 through June 30, 2006 for certain executive officers). Following the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the number of shares of SAs to be issued was 37 million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. One-third of the awards vested in each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2008. An additional one-third of the awards will vest in fiscal year 2009. Because the SPSAs covered a three-year period, SPSAs issued in fiscal year 2006 were given only to newly hired and promoted employees eligible to receive SPSAs.
 
The Company granted SPSAs for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 with performance periods of July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007 and July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008, respectively. At the end of the fiscal year performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. An additional number of shares, approximately 15% of the total target SPSAs, are available as additional awards to participants based on individual performance. One-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares vest over each of the following three years. Following the end of the fiscal year 2007 performance period, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determined that the number of shares of SAs to be issued was 11 million, based on the actual performance against metrics established for the performance period. The number of shares of SAs to be issued for the fiscal year 2008 performance period will be determined in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
We measure the fair value of SAs and SPSAs based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends. SAs and SPSAs are amortized over their applicable vesting period (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method. The fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:
 
During fiscal year 2008, the following activity occurred under our existing plans:
 
As of June 30, 2008, there was $3.2 billion and $586 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to SAs and SPSAs, respectively. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.4 years and 2.8 years, respectively.
SPSAs granted in fiscal year 2008 include adjustments for estimated performance against performance targets.
 
During fiscal year 2007 and 2006, the following activity occurred under our plans:
 
 In fiscal year 2004, we began granting employees SAs rather than stock options as part of our equity compensation plans. Since then, stock options issued to employees have been issued primarily in conjunction with business acquisitions. Nonqualified stock options were granted to our directors under our non-employee director stock plan. Nonqualified and incentive stock options were granted to certain officers and employees under our employee stock plans. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half years or over seven and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and one-half years and expire ten years from the date of grant. Approximately ten million, two million, and one million stock options were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Stock Options.
Employee stock options outstanding were as follows:
 
Options outstanding as of June 30, 2008 include approximately 12 million options that were granted in conjunction with business acquisitions. While these options are included in the options outstanding balance, they are excluded from the weighted average exercise price of $28.12 presented. These options have an exercise price range of $0 to $150.93 and a weighted average exercise price of $9.03.
During fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 the following activity occurred under our plans:
 
Cash received and income tax benefits from stock option exercises were $3.0 billion and $365 million, respectively, for fiscal year 2008.
 
Segment revenue and operating income (loss) was as follows:

(In millions)
 
SFAS No. 131, , establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. This standard requires segmentation based on our internal organization and reporting of revenue and operating income based upon internal accounting methods. Our financial reporting systems present various data for management to operate the business, including internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U.S. GAAP. The segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Amounts for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current management view. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer. Our five segments are Client; Server and Tools; Online Services Business; Microsoft Business Division; and Entertainment and Devices Division.
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
The types of products and services provided by each segment are summarized below:
 Windows Vista, including Home, Home Premium, Ultimate, Business, Enterprise and Starter Edition; Windows XP Professional and Home; Media Center Edition; Tablet PC Edition; and other standard Windows operating systems.
Client
 Windows Server operating system; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft Enterprise Services; product support services; Visual Studio; System Center products; Forefront security products; Biz Talk Server; MSDN; and other products and services.
Server and Tools
 Live Search; MSN; MapPoint; MSN Internet Access; MSN Premium Web Services (consisting of MSN Internet Software Subscription, MSN Hotmail Plus, and MSN Software Services); Windows Live; MSN Mobile Services; AvenueA Razorfish media agency services; Atlas online tools for advertisers; and the Drive PM ad network for publishers.
Online Services Business
 
 Microsoft Office; Microsoft Project; Microsoft Visio; Microsoft Office SharePoint Server; Microsoft PerformancePoint; Microsoft Office Live; FAST ESP; Microsoft Exchange Server; Microsoft Exchange Hosted Services; Microsoft Office Live Meeting; Microsoft Office Communication Server; Microsoft Office Communicator; Microsoft Tellme Service, Microsoft Dynamics AX; Microsoft Dynamics CRM; Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online; Microsoft Dynamics GP; Microsoft Dynamics NAV; Microsoft Dynamics SL; Microsoft Dynamics Retail Management System; Microsoft Partner Program; and Microsoft Office Accounting.
Microsoft Business Division
 Xbox 360 console and games; Xbox Live; Zune; Mediaroom; numerous consumer software and hardware products (such as mice and keyboards); Windows Mobile software and services platform; Windows Embedded device operating system; Windows Automotive; and Surface computing platform.
Entertainment and Devices Division
Because of our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments, and therefore these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared efforts. Management will continually evaluate the alignment of product development organizations, sales organizations, and inter-segment commissions for segment reporting purposes, which may result in changes to segment allocations in future periods.
Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.
Reconciling amounts include adjustments to conform with U.S. GAAP and corporate-level activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U.S. GAAP relate to revenue recognition, income statement classification, and accelerated amortization for depreciation, stock awards, and performance-based stock awards. In addition, certain revenue and expenses are excluded from segments or included in corporate-level activity including certain legal settlements and accruals for legal contingencies.
Significant reconciling items were as follows:

No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007 revenue. Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 11% of fiscal year 2006 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels and cover a broad array of products including Windows PC operating systems, Microsoft Office, and server products.
 
Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers are located, was as follows:
(In millions)
 
 
Long-lived assets, classified by the geographic location of the controlling statutory company in which that company operates, were as follows:
(In millions)
 
Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income, net. Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, and as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations.
The financial statements and accompanying notes have been recast to reflect the following gains resulting from foreign currency remeasurements which were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and are now presented as other income, net: fiscal year 2008 - $221 million; fiscal year 2007 - $86 million; and fiscal year 2006 - $92 million. This recast impacts the income statement line items sales and marketing expense, operating income, and other income, net. In addition, information in Note 3, "Other Income, Net" and Note 19, "Segment Information" has been recast to be consistent with the changes to the presentation of this financial information.

On January 22, 2009, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
On January 22, 2009, Microsoft Corporation chief executive officer Steve Ballmer sent an email message to all Microsoft employees concerning the company's financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008, the current economic climate and actions the company is taking to manage costs. The text of the email message is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $16.63 billion for the second quarter ended Dec. 31, 2008, a 2% increase over the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $5.94 billion, $4.17 billion and $0.47, declines of 8%, 11% and 6%, respectively, compared with the prior year.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 22, 2009 
Client revenue declined 8% as a result of PC market weakness and a continued shift to lower priced netbooks. However, strong annuity licensing drove Server & Tools revenue growth of 15%. Entertainment and Devices revenue grew 3% driven by strong holiday demand for Xbox 360 consoles with a record 6 million units sold in the quarter.
During the quarter, Microsoft showcased significant new product innovations by debuting Windows 7, Windows Azure, Office Web applications, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Office Communications Server 2007 R2. Microsoft also announced general availability of Silverlight 2, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Windows Small Business Server 2008, Windows Essential Business Server 2008 and a new release of Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
"While we are not immune to the effects of the economy, I am confident in the strength of our product portfolio and soundness of our approach," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "We will continue to manage expenses and invest in long-term opportunities to deliver value to customers and shareholders, and we will emerge an even stronger industry leader than we are today."
In light of the further deterioration of global economic conditions, Microsoft announced additional steps to manage costs, including the reduction of headcount-related expenses, vendors and contingent staff, facilities, capital expenditures and marketing. As part of this plan, Microsoft will eliminate up to 5,000 jobs in R&D, marketing, sales, finance,
legal, HR, and IT over the next 18 months, including 1,400 jobs today. These initiatives will reduce the company's annual operating expense run rate by approximately $1.5 billion and reduce fiscal year 2009 capital expenditures by $700 million.
Business Outlook
"Economic activity and IT spend slowed beyond our expectations in the quarter, and we acted quickly to reduce our cost structure and mitigate its impact," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "We are planning for economic uncertainty to continue through the remainder of the fiscal year, almost certainly leading to lower revenue and earnings for the second half relative to the previous year. In this environment, we will focus on outperforming our competitors and addressing our cost structure."
Due to the volatility of market conditions going forward, Microsoft is no longer able to offer quantitative revenue and EPS guidance for the balance of this fiscal year. Microsoft offers operating expense guidance of approximately $27.4 billion for the full year ending June 30, 2009. This information supercedes the fiscal year 2009 guidance that Microsoft provided on Oct. 23, 2008. Management will discuss second-quarter results, and the company's qualitative business outlook on a conference call and webcast at 8 a.m. PST (11 a.m. EST) today.
Webcast Details
Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer, Chris Liddell, senior vice president and chief financial officer, Frank Brod, corporate vice president and chief accounting officer, and Bill Koefoed, general manager of Investor Relations, will host a conference call and webcast to discuss details of the company's performance for the quarter and certain forward-looking information. The session may be accessed at http://www.microsoft.com/msft. The webcast will be available for replay through the close of business on Jan. 22, 2010.

Exhibit 99.2
From: Steve Ballmer
To: All Microsoft FTE
Subject: Realigning Resources and Reducing Costs
In response to the realities of a deteriorating economy, we're taking important steps to realign Microsoft's business. I want to tell you about what we're doing and why.
Today we announced second quarter revenue of $16.6 billion. This number is an increase of just 2 percent compared with the second quarter of last year and it is approximately $900 million below our earlier expectations.
The fact that we are growing at all during the worst recession in two generations reflects our strong business fundamentals and is a testament to your hard work. Our products provide great value to our customers. Our financial position is solid. We have made long-term investments that continue to pay off.
But it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy. Consumers and businesses have reined in spending, which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures.
Our response to this environment must combine a commitment to long-term investments in innovation with prompt action to reduce our costs.
During the second quarter we started down the right path. As the economy deteriorated, we acted quickly. As a result, we reduced operating expenses during the quarter by $600 million. I appreciate the agility you have shown in enabling us to achieve this result.
Now we need to do more. We must make adjustments to ensure that our investments are tightly aligned with current and future revenue opportunities. The current environment requires that we continue to increase our efficiency.
As part of the process of adjustments, we will eliminate up to 5,000 positions in R&D, marketing, sales, finance, LCA, HR, and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 will occur today. We'll also open new positions to support key investment areas during this same period of time. Our net headcount in these functions will decline by 2,000 to 3,000 over the next 18 months. In addition, our workforce in support, consulting, operations, billing, manufacturing, and data center operations will continue to change in direct response to customer needs.
Our leaders all have specific goals to manage costs prudently and thoughtfully. They have the flexibility to adjust the size of their teams so they are appropriately matched to revenue potential, to add headcount where they need to increase investments in order to ensure future success, and to drive efficiency.
To increase efficiency, we're taking a series of aggressive steps. We'll cut travel expenditures 20 percent and make significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent staff. We've scaled back Puget Sound campus expansion and reduced marketing budgets. We'll also reduce costs by eliminating merit increases for FY10 that would have taken effect in September of this calendar year.
Each of these steps will be difficult. Our priority remains doing right by our customers and our employees. For employees who are directly affected, I know this will be a difficult time for you and I want to assure you that we will provide help and support during this transition. We have established an outplacement center in the Puget Sound region and we'll provide outplacement services in many other locations to help you find new jobs. Some of you may find jobs internally. For those who don't, we will also offer severance pay and other benefits.
The decision to eliminate jobs is a very difficult one. Our people are the foundation of everything we have achieved and we place the highest value on the commitment and hard work that you have dedicated to building this company. But we believe these job eliminations are crucial to our ability to adjust the company's cost structure so that we have the resources to drive future profitable growth. I encourage you to attend tomorrow's Town Hall at 9am PST in Caf 34 or watch the .
webcast
While this is the most challenging economic climate we have ever faced, I want to reiterate my confidence in the strength of our competitive position and soundness of our approach.
With these changes in place, I feel confident that we will have the resources we need to continue to invest in long-term computing trends that offer the greatest opportunity to deliver value to our customers and shareholders, benefit to society, and growth for Microsoft.
With our approach to investing for the long term and managing our expenses, I know Microsoft will emerge an even stronger industry leader than it is today.
Thank you for your continued commitment and hard work.
Steve

Dr. Klawe and Microsoft have entered into the standard Microsoft director indemnification agreement, whereby Microsoft agrees to indemnify, defend and hold its directors harmless from and against losses and expenses incurred as a result of their board service, subject to the terms and conditions provided in the agreement.
 
(d) Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
March 9, 2009
Microsoft Corp. today announced that Maria Klawe, Ph.D., president of Harvey Mudd College, was appointed to the company's board of directors, returning the board's size to 10 members. The company also announced that the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.13 per share. The dividend is payable June 18, 2009, to shareholders of record on May 21, 2009. The ex-dividend date will be May 19, 2009.
REDMOND, Wash.  March 9, 2009 
"Maria has made significant research contributions to computer science and mathematics, and we are very fortunate to have her join Microsoft's board of directors," said Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman. "In particular, I think her close connection to university students and the way they shape computing trends will bring an important perspective to the board."
Klawe has been president of Harvey Mudd College  a highly regarded private liberal arts college in Claremont, Calif., that focuses on engineering, science, and mathematics  since 2006. Before joining Harvey Mudd College, she served as dean of engineering and a professor of computer science at Princeton University from 2003 to 2006, and held several positions at the University of British Columbia from 1988 to 2002 including dean of science, vice president of student and academic services, and head of the Department of Computer Science. She also worked at IBM Research in California for eight years, and held academic positions at the University of Toronto and Oakland University.
 
"Through her strategic planning work at Harvey Mudd College, Princeton and elsewhere, Maria has demonstrated the kind of long-term vision and focus that we were looking to add to the board," said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO. "In addition, there's no doubt that she brings a solid grasp of the technologies that will be important to Microsoft's future growth opportunities."
"Computing, and the role it plays in people's lives, is on the verge of an incredible transformation," Klawe said. "Microsoft plays a unique role in shaping the impact that technology has on society, and I'm excited to join Microsoft's board at this point in computing history."
Klawe was the first woman to serve on the board of the Computing Research Association and she co-founded CRA-W, the highly successful Committee on the Status of Women. She has served on the board of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology since its inception and as chair from 20032008. From 19972002 she held the IBM-NSERC Chair for Women in Science and Engineering for British Columbia and the Yukon, and led several research studies and projects related to increasing the participation of women in computing.
"The underrepresentation of women in the fields of science and engineering is one of the critical issues facing the computing industry," Klawe said. "Microsoft has been active and focused in helping to address this challenge, and I'm looking forward to helping the company continue to make progress on this important issue."
Klawe is also a past president of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), a trustee of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, Calif., and a member of the board of Math for America. She is a fellow of ACM and the Canadian Information Processing Society and the recipient of numerous awards including the Computing Research Association's Nico Habermann Award. Klawe holds several honorary doctorate degrees in the areas of science and mathematics. She received her Ph.D. and bachelor of science in mathematics from the University of Alberta.
 
Klawe has made significant research contributions in several areas of mathematics and computer science including functional analysis, discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, and the design and use of interactive multimedia for mathematics education. Her current research interests include discrete mathematics, serious games and assistive technologies.
In addition to Klawe, Microsoft's board of directors consists of Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman; Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO; James I. Cash Jr., Ph.D., James E. Robison professor and senior associate dean emeritus of Harvard Business School; Dina Dublon, former chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase; Raymond V. Gilmartin, former chairman, president and CEO of Merck & Co. Inc.; Reed Hastings, founder, chairman and CEO of Netflix Inc.; David F. Marquardt, general partner at August Capital; Charles H. Noski, former vice chairman of AT&T Corp.; and Dr. Helmut Panke, former chairman of the board of management at BMW AG.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $13.65 billion for the third quarter ended March 31, 2009, a 6% decline from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $4.44 billion, $2.98 billion and $0.33 per share, which represented an increase of 3% and declines of 32% and 30%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period.
REDMOND, Wash.  April 23, 2009 
The financial results for the third quarter ended March 31, 2009, included $290 million of severance charges related to the previously announced plan to reduce up to 5,000 positions and $420 million of impairments to investments. Combined, these two charges reduced earnings per share by $0.06.
Revenue in Client, Microsoft Business Division, and Server & Tools was negatively impacted by weakness in the global PC and Server markets. Revenue from enterprise customers remained stable during the quarter.
"With our continued R&D investment and our broad suite of products and services, we remain in a great position to compete and gain share in the marketplace," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. During the quarter, Microsoft released the beta version of the Windows 7 operating system, which remains on track for a fiscal year 2010 launch. Development milestones were achieved on other products including Microsoft Office 2010, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Mobile.
"While market conditions remained weak during the quarter, I was pleased with the organization's ability to offset revenue pressures with the swift implementation of cost-savings initiatives," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "We expect the weakness to continue through at least the next quarter."
Business Outlook
Microsoft offers updated operating expense guidance of $26.7 billion to $26.9 billion, including severance charges, for the full year ending June 30, 2009.
Management will discuss third quarter results and the company's business outlook on a conference call and webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT) today.
Webcast Details
Chris Liddell, senior vice president and chief financial officer, Frank Brod, corporate vice president and chief accounting officer, and Bill Koefoed, general manager of Investor Relations, will host a conference call and webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT) today to discuss details of the company's performance for the quarter and certain forward-looking information.

(g) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there shall not have been a material adverse change in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto), the effect of which is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;

(j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery a certificate of the Company signed by an officer of the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives as to (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein as of the Time of Delivery, (ii) the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery and (iii) the matters set forth in Sections 7(b) and 7(g) hereof.
8. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act) relating to the offering of the Securities, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any such issuer free writing prospectus, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of, or omission or alleged omission to state, a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 8(c), the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to not more than one separate local counsel in any jurisdiction in which the indemnified party requires representation by separate counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
provided
however
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Defaulting Underwriters
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but if for any other reason the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (ii) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is, and has been, acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company directly or indirectly, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed, or will assume, an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any similar obligation to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
Nature of Underwriters' Obligations
13. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by any of the Representatives and may assume that such statement, request, notice or agreement has been duly authorized by such Underwriter.
Authority of Representatives
 
14. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the addresses set forth on hereto; and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399, Attention: Corporate Vice President and Treasurer; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth on hereto, shall be provided to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $13.10 billion for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2009, a 17% decline from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $3.99 billion, $3.05 billion and $0.34 per share, which represented declines of 30%, 29% and 26%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period.
REDMOND, Wash.  July 23, 2009 
"Our business continued to be negatively impacted by weakness in the global PC and server markets," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "In light of that environment, it was an excellent achievement to deliver over $750 million of operational savings compared to the prior year quarter."
The financial results for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2009, included the deferral of $276 million of revenue related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program that was announced on June 25, 2009. This revenue deferral reduced earnings per share by $0.02.
The fourth-quarter financial results also included $193 million of legal charges, $108 million of impairments to investments and $40 million of additional severance charges related to the previously announced plan. Operating expenses were reduced by $105 million of capitalized research and development expenses due to the technical milestones reached for Windows 7. Combined, these items also reduced earnings per share by $0.02.
Significant product milestones were achieved in the quarter including the releases of Windows 7 release candidate, Windows Server 2008 R2 release candidate, as well as Bing, Microsoft's search engine designed to help people make faster, more informed decisions.
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009, Microsoft reported revenue of $58.44 billion, a 3% decline from the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the year were $20.36 billion, $14.57 billion and $1.62, which represented declines of 9%, 18% and 13% respectively.
"While economic conditions presented challenges this year, we maintained our focus on delivering customer satisfaction and providing solutions to our customers to save money," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "I am very excited by the wave of product and services innovations being delivered in this next fiscal year."
Business Outlook
Microsoft is providing operating expense guidance of $26.6 billion to $27.0 billion, for the full year ending June 30, 2010.
Management will discuss fourth-quarter results and the company's business outlook on a conference call and webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT) today.

Summary
 
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
Revenue declined across all segments driven primarily by weakness in the global PC market and the unfavorable economic environment. Primary factors contributing to the decline include the following:
 
 
 
 
Operating income declined primarily driven by decreased revenue, partially offset by decreased operating expenses. The reduction in operating expenses included cost savings as a result of the resource management program implemented in January 2009 described below. The following components contributed to the overall decrease in operating expenses:
 
 
 
 
Diluted earnings per share declined reflecting decreased net income, partially offset by share repurchases during the fiscal year. While we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended June 30, 2009, we repurchased 318 million shares during the first nine months of fiscal year 2009.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
Revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global PC market and the unfavorable economic environment. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $486 million or one percentage point increase in revenue. Primary factors contributing to the decline include the following:
 
 
Operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue. Operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcount-related expenses, cost of revenue, and employee severance charges.
 
 
 
 
In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. As part of this program, we are eliminating up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by June 30, 2010. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $330 million for the expected reduction in headcount.
 
Diluted earnings per share declined primarily reflecting decreased net income, partially offset by share repurchases during the past 12 months. We repurchased 318 million shares during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009.
On July 22, 2009, the Company announced that Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 were released to manufacturing. General availability for both products is expected to be October 22, 2009.
SEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is presented separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor performance at the segment level during the current period.
Client
 
Client offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems. Premium editions are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Media Center, and Windows XP Tablet PC. Standard editions include Windows Vista Home Basic and Windows XP Home. Client revenue growth is directly impacted by growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected primarily by changes in the mix of OEM Windows premium edition operating systems licensed as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed ("OEM premium mix"), changes in geographic mix, and changes in the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders.
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
Client revenue decreased primarily as a result of PC market weakness, especially PCs sold to businesses, and a 13 percentage point decline in the OEM premium mix to 59%. Revenue growth from Windows operating systems was also impacted by a $276 million deferral for the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program. OEM revenue decreased $1.1 billion or 31%, while OEM license units decreased 10%. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources declined approximately 5% to 7%, driven by decreased demand in emerging and developed markets.
Client operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue, partially offset by decreased research and development and other operating expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $91 million or 31%, primarily reflecting the capitalization of certain Windows 7 software development costs.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
Client revenue decreased primarily as a result of PC market weakness, especially PCs sold to businesses, and a 10 percentage point decline in the OEM premium mix to 64%. OEM revenue
 
decreased $2.3 billion or 16% while OEM license units declined 2%. Based on our estimates, total worldwide PC shipments from all sources changed approximately (1%) to 2%, driven by changes in demand in emerging and developed markets.
Client operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue and increased sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $122 million or 7%, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing.
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and services that are designed to make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Server and Tools offerings consist of server software licenses and client access licenses ("CAL") for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and other server products. We also offer developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server products can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple channels for licensing, including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. We sell licenses both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses.
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
Server and Tools revenue decreased primarily reflecting a decline in demand for server hardware as a result of the unfavorable economic environment. Server and server application revenue (including CAL) and developer tools revenue decreased $173 million or 6%, primarily due to decreased Windows Server and SQL Server revenue, partly offset by increased Enterprise CAL Suites and System Center revenue. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue decreased $38 million or 5%, reflecting a decline in consulting services provided. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for an $82 million or two percentage point decrease in revenue.
Server and Tools operating income decreased primarily due to decreased revenue, mostly offset by lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $92 million or 13%, reflecting the decrease in demand for consulting services. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $77 million or 7%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related expenses associated with our corporate sales force.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product and services revenue. Server and server application revenue (including CAL) and developer tools revenue increased $809 million or 8%, primarily driven by growth in SQL Server, Enterprise CAL Suites, and System Center revenue. This growth reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements and continued adoption of the Windows Server Platform and applications. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue increased $215 million or 8%, primarily due to revenue from annuity support agreements. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $140 million or one percentage point increase in revenue.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to growth in product revenue, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and cost of revenue. Research and development expenses increased $168 million or 9%, primarily driven by increased headcount-related expenses. Cost of revenue increased $84 million or 3%, reflecting the growth in support, online, and consulting services.
 
Online Services Business
 
Online Services Business ("OSB") consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, personal communications services such as email and instant messaging, and online information offerings such as Bing and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, email, messaging services, and advertiser and publisher tools. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, digital marketing and advertising agency services, and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers.
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
OSB revenue decreased primarily reflecting decreased online advertising revenue and included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $28 million or three percentage points. Online advertising revenue decreased $86 million or 14%, to $529 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in display advertising.
OSB operating loss increased primarily due to increased cost of revenue and decreased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $149 million or 26%, primarily driven by increased online traffic acquisition costs.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
OSB revenue decreased primarily as a result of decreased online advertising and access revenue. Online advertising revenue decreased $73 million or 3%, to $2.3 billion, reflecting a decrease in display advertising, partially offset by an increase in search advertising. Access revenue decreased $72 million or 28%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $28 million or one percentage point decrease in revenue.
OSB operating loss increased due to increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses, and decreased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $692 million or 36%, primarily driven by increased online traffic acquisition, data center and equipment, and headcount-related costs. Research and development expenses increased $149 million or 13%, primarily due to increased headcount-related expenses.
Microsoft Business Division
 
Microsoft Business Division ("MBD") offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Growth of revenue from the Microsoft Office system offerings, which generate over 90% of MBD revenue, depends on our ability to add value to the core Office product set and to continue to expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as content management, enterprise search, collaboration, unified communications, and business intelligence. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics
 
applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
MBD revenue decreased reflecting decreased business and consumer revenue and included an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $75 million or one percentage point. Business revenue decreased $413 million or 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in volume licensing agreement revenue, and included a 13% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. Consumer revenue decreased $289 million or 30%, primarily as a result of PC market weakness, a shift to lower-priced products, and pricing promotions on the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income decreased reflecting decreased revenue, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $116 million or 10%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
MBD revenue was flat reflecting decreased consumer revenue offset by increased business revenue, and included a favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of $378 million or two percentage points. Consumer revenue decreased $525 million or 14%, primarily as a result of PC market weakness, a shift to lower-priced products, and pricing promotions on the 2007 Microsoft Office system. Business revenue increased $490 million or 3%, primarily reflecting growth in volume licensing agreement revenue and included a 7% decrease in Microsoft Dynamics customer billings. The growth in volume licensing agreement revenue primarily reflects recognition of deferred revenue from previously signed agreements.
MBD operating income decreased reflecting increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased sales and marketing expenses. Cost of revenue increased $135 million or 14%, primarily driven by expenses associated with Fast Search & Transfer ASA ("FAST") which we acquired in April 2008, as well as online services infrastructure costs. Research and development expenses increased $119 million or 8%, primarily driven by an increase in headcount-related expenses associated with FAST. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $90 million or 2%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities and headcount-related costs associated with our corporate sales force.
Entertainment and Devices Division
 
Entertainment and Devices Division ("EDD") offerings include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console system, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox Live, and Xbox 360 accessories), the Zune digital music and entertainment platform, PC software games, online games and services, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), the Surface computing platform, mobile and embedded device platforms, and other devices. EDD leads the development efforts for our line of consumer software and hardware products including application software for Apple's Macintosh computers and Microsoft PC hardware products, and is responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and Windows operating systems.
 
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
EDD revenue decreased across most lines of our business. Revenue from non-gaming business decreased $291 million or 42%, primarily reflecting decreased Mediaroom and Zune revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $110 million or 12%, primarily as a result of decreased Xbox 360 console sales and decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console due to price reductions during the past 12 months, partially offset by increased Xbox Live revenue. We shipped 1.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, compared with 1.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $27 million or two percentage point decrease in revenue.
EDD operating loss decreased primarily due to decreased costs of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, mostly offset by decreased revenue. Cost of revenue decreased $266 million or 31%, primarily driven by decreased Xbox 360 platform costs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $107 million or 30%, reflecting decreased advertising and marketing expenses.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
EDD revenue decreased across most lines of business. Revenue from our non-gaming business decreased $292 million or 12%, primarily reflecting decreased Zune and PC hardware product revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $161 million or 3%, primarily as a result of decreased revenue per Xbox 360 console due to price reductions during the past 12 months, partially offset by increased Xbox 360 console sales and increased Xbox Live revenue. We shipped 11.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2009, compared with 8.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2008. Foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a $74 million or one percentage point decrease in revenue.
EDD operating income decreased primarily due to decreased revenue and increased research and development expenses, partially offset by decreased cost of revenue. Research and development expenses increased $252 million or 16%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses associated with the Windows Mobile device platform, driven by recent acquisitions. Cost of revenue decreased $326 million or 7%, primarily due to decreased Xbox 360 platform costs.
Corporate-Level Activity
 
Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments. Those results include expenses such as broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, legal settlements and contingencies, and employee severance.
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
Corporate-level expenses decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily due to a decrease in sales and marketing expenses of $391 million or 75%, reflecting the resource management plan implemented in January 2009, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses reflecting increased costs for legal settlements and legal contingences. We incurred $193 million of legal charges during the three months ended June 30, 2009.
 
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
Corporate-level expenses decreased during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by employee severance charges of $330 million. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.4 billion or 28%, primarily due to decreased costs for legal settlements and contingencies. We incurred $283 million of legal charges during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009 as compared to $1.8 billion during the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. The prior year costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million). Sales and marketing expenses decreased $412 million or 30%, reflecting the resource management plan implemented in January 2009.
Operating Expenses
Cost of Revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to drive traffic to our website and/or acquire online advertising space ("traffic acquisition costs"), costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, warranty costs, inventory valuation adjustments, costs associated with the delivery of consulting services, and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products that have reached technological feasibility. Cost of revenue decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting decreased Xbox 360 platform costs and decreased costs associated with the decline in consulting services provided, partially offset by increased online traffic acquisition costs. Cost of revenue increased during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting increased online costs, including traffic acquisition, data center and equipment, and headcount costs, partially offset by decreased Xbox 360 platform costs.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, the amortization of purchased software code and services content, and in-process research and development. Research and development expenses decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting the capitalization of $105 million of certain Windows 7 software development costs. Research and development expenses increased during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting a 13% increase in headcount-related costs.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2009, primarily driven by the resource management program implemented in January 2009. During the three months ended June 30, 2009, we also reduced headcount-related costs by 10%.
Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. For the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2009, $46 million of gains and $509 million of losses, respectively, were reported as other income (expense). For the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2008, $5 million and $221 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).
General and Administrative
 
General and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting $193 million of costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies, partially offset by decreased professional consulting fees. General and administrative expenses decreased during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, primarily reflecting decreased costs for legal settlements and legal contingencies. We incurred legal charges of $283 million during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, as compared with $1.8 billion during the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. The fiscal year 2008 legal costs were primarily related to the European Commission fine of $1.4 billion (899 million).
Employee Severance
In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital expenditures. As part of this program, we are eliminating up to 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology by June 30, 2010. During the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2009, we recorded employee severance charges of $40 million and $330 million, respectively, for the expected reduction in headcount.
 
Other Income (Expense)
The components of other income (expense) were as follows:
 
Effective July 1, 2008, we began presenting gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of other income (expense). Prior to July 1, 2008, we included gains and losses resulting from foreign currency remeasurements as a component of sales and marketing expense. We changed our presentation because this better reflects how we manage these foreign currency exposures, as such gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are incidental to our operations. For the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2009, $46 million of gains and $509 million of losses, respectively, were reported as other income (expense). For the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2008, $5 million and $221 million of gains, respectively, were previously recorded as a component of sales and marketing expense and have been recast as other income (expense).
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized losses on investments increased due to lower gains on sales of investments and higher other-than-temporary impairments. Other-than-temporary impairments were $108 million during the three months ended June 30, 2009, as compared with $64 million during the three months ended June 30, 2008 and increased primarily due to the declines in equity markets from the prior year. Net gains on derivatives increased primarily due to lower costs associated with hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues and gains on interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with losses in the prior period.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
Dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed-income investments. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher other-than-temporary impairments that were partially offset by gains on sales of certain equity investments held in our strategic investments portfolio. Other-than-temporary impairments were $862 million during the twelve months ended June 30, 2009, as compared with $312 million during the twelve months ended June 30, 2008, and increased primarily due to declines in equity values as a result of deterioration in equity markets. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity, commodity, and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period. Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year.
 
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 27% for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2009. Our effective tax rate was 28% for the three months and 26% for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. The fiscal year 2008 rate was lower primarily due to the resolution of tax positions relating to our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") settling the 2000-2003 examination. As a result of this settlement and the related impact on subsequent years, we paid the IRS approximately $4.1 billion during fiscal year 2009.
Financial Condition
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2009, compared with $23.7 billion as of June 30, 2008. Equity and other investments were $4.9 billion as of June 30, 2009, compared with $6.6 billion as of June 30, 2008. Our investments consist primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also includes foreign-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. We invest primarily in short-term securities to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. As a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $22.8 billion at June 30, 2009. Our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate, pay dividends, or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position.
Share Repurchases
We repurchased common stock in fiscal year 2009 using available cash resources as follows:
 
While we did not repurchase any shares during the three months ended June 30, 2009, $22 million of shares were withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations on employee stock awards that vested during the quarter. These share withholdings are included with common stock repurchases in the financial statements.
Debt
Short-term Debt
In September 2008, our Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. Pursuant to the authorization, we established a commercial paper program providing for the issuance and sale of up to $2.0 billion in short-term commercial paper. As of June 30, 2009, $2.0 billion of the commercial paper was issued and outstanding with a weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20% and maturities of 22 to 119 days.
In September 2008, we also entered into a $2.0 billion six-month senior unsecured credit facility, principally to support the commercial paper program. In November 2008, we replaced the six-month credit facility with a $2.0 billion 364-day credit facility. This credit facility expires on November 6, 2009. In March 2009, we entered into an additional credit facility. This $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expires on March
 
12, 2010. As of June 30, 2009, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during the year ended June 30, 2009.
Long-term Debt
In November 2008, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue debt securities from time to time pursuant to the September 2008 authorization for debt financings of up to $6.0 billion. In May 2009, we sold $3.75 billion of debt securities under that registration statement as follows: $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.95% notes due 2014, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due 2019, and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% notes due 2039 (collectively "the Notes"). Interest on the debt securities will be payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2009, to holders of record on the preceding May 15 and November 15. The debt securities are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is comprised of the following items:
Represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, which are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period.
Volume licensing programs
Represents the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis and free post-delivery telephone support. This revenue deferral is applicable for Windows XP and prior versions shipped as retail packaged products, products licensed to OEMs, and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs. The amount recorded as unearned is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product's life cycle. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three and one-half years for Windows operating systems. Undelivered elements include $276 million of deferred revenue related to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program.
Undelivered elements
Represents payments for post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products, Xbox Live subscriptions, Mediaroom, and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
Other
The components of unearned revenue were as follows:
 
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
The following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2009:
 
Cash Flows
Three months ended June 30, 2009 compared with three months ended June 30, 2008
Cash flow from operations decreased $244 million, reflecting the 17% decrease in revenue and resulting decline in cash from customers. This impact was partially offset by other changes in working capital along with the $1.7 billion decrease in cash paid for other current liabilities reflecting the fiscal year 2008 payment of the European Commission fine. Cash from financing was $2.7 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2009 as compared with cash used of $5.1 billion in the prior fiscal year. This increase in cash was due to a $4.3 billion decrease in stock repurchases along with $3.8 billion of net cash proceeds from issuance of short-term and long-term debt. Cash used for investing increased $7.4 billion due to a $9.8 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities partially offset by a $2.0 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2009 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2008
Cash flow from operations decreased $2.6 billion due to payments of approximately $4.1 billion to the IRS in connection with our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination. This impact was partially offset by the fiscal year 2008 payment of the $1.4 billion (899 million) European Commission fine. Cash used for financing decreased $5.5 billion, primarily due to $5.7 billion of net cash proceeds from issuance of short-term and long-term debt in fiscal year 2009. Financing activities also included a $3.2 billion decrease in common stock repurchased, which was offset by a $2.9 billion decline in common stock issued. Cash used for investing increased $11.2 billion due to a $15.9 billion rise in purchases of investments along with a $1.7 billion decrease in cash from investment sales and maturities. These impacts were partially offset by a $7.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisition of companies, reflecting the purchase of aQuantive in fiscal year 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
For Release Noon PDT
Sept. 11, 2009
Microsoft Corp. today announced that James I. Cash Jr., Ph.D., emeritus James E. Robison professor at the Harvard Business School, has decided not to seek re-election to Microsoft's board of directors at the company's 2009 shareholder meeting.
REDMOND, Wash.  Sept. 11, 2009 
Cash, who joined the Microsoft board in May 2001, said that he has enjoyed working with his colleagues on the board, but was stepping down due to increasing pressure on his time from other professional and personal commitments.
"Jim has brought tremendous wisdom and judgment to our board, as well as keen insights into our enterprise business efforts based on his academic work at Harvard," said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer. "We appreciate all of his contributions and we will certainly miss his leadership and perspective."
"This was a difficult decision. I have tremendous respect for my colleagues on the Microsoft board, and I have enjoyed the work we've done together over the past eight years," Cash said. "Microsoft has a tremendous innovation pipeline coming to market over the next two years, so the company is well-positioned for growth as the economy improves."
With Cash's departure, the Microsoft board will have nine members: Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft; Steve Ballmer; Dina Dublon, former chief financial officer of JPMorgan
 
Chase; Raymond V. Gilmartin, former chairman, president and chief executive officer of Merck & Co. Inc.; Reed Hastings, founder, chairman and CEO of Netflix Inc.; Maria M. Klawe, president, Harvey Mudd College; David F. Marquardt, general partner at August Capital; Charles H. Noski, former vice chairman of AT&T Corp.; and Dr. Helmut Panke, former chairman of the board of management at BMW AG.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced revenue of $12.92 billion for the first quarter ended Sept. 30, 2009, a 14% decline from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $4.48 billion, $3.57 billion and $0.40 per share, which represented declines of 25%, 18% and 17%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period.
REDMOND, Wash.  Oct. 23, 2009 
These financial results reflect the deferral of $1.47 billion of revenue, an impact of $0.12 of diluted earnings per share, relating to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program and sales of Windows 7 to OEMs and retailers before general availability. Adding back the deferred revenue, revenue totaled $14.39 billion, a 4% year-over-year decline, and EPS totaled $0.52 per share, an increase of 8% over the same period of the prior year.
"We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and particularly by the strong consumer demand for Windows," said Chris Liddell, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "We also maintained our cost discipline, which allowed us to drive strong earnings performance despite continued tough overall economic conditions."
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 launched globally on Oct. 22 as anticipated. Also during October, Microsoft released Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 to manufacturing and in July announced a strategic partnership with Yahoo! Inc. to provide search results for their global properties.
"The worldwide launches of Windows 7, Exchange Server 2010 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are exciting milestones for Microsoft, our partners, and customers," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We are pleased by the early positive response we are receiving for these products."
Business Outlook
Microsoft is reducing operating expense guidance to $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion, for the full year ending June 30, 2010.

On November 24, 2009, the Company announced the appointment of Peter Klein, age 47, to serve as chief financial officer. Since February 2006, Mr. Klein has been serving as corporate vice president and chief financial officer of the Microsoft Business Division.

He was responsible for overall financial management of the Business Division, including financial and strategic planning, reporting and analysis, as well as communications to the investment community. Prior to his role in the Business Division, Mr. Klein was chief financial officer of Microsoft's Server & Tools Business Group beginning in July 2003. Mr. Klein joined Microsoft in 2002.
As chief financial officer, Mr. Klein will be paid an annual base salary of $500,000 and has been approved as a participant under the Company's Executive Officer Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan").

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced that Chris Liddell will be leaving the company at the end of 2009, and named Peter Klein as the company's new chief financial officer.
REDMOND, Wash.  Nov. 24, 2009 
"Chris and his finance team have accomplished a great deal over the past four and a half years. The team is deep and strong, and has an excellent record of building value for our shareholders," said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive officer. "Peter brings great finance and operation expertise and a deep understanding of the company, and I am looking forward to a smooth transition that continues our commitment to cost containment and finance excellence."
In the past fiscal year, Microsoft reduced costs by $3 billion compared with its original plan, and returned $14 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buy-back.
Klein, 47, joined Microsoft in February 2002 and currently serves as CFO of Microsoft's Business Division, overseeing all financial strategy, management and reporting for the $18.9 billion business with 7,800 full-time employees. Previously, Klein served three years as CFO of Microsoft's Server and Tools Business.
"My time at Microsoft has been an outstanding experience, and I am delighted to be leaving the company in such great shape," Liddell said. "We have built a world class finance team and established strong internal accountability. Microsoft is coming out of the economic downturn with not only great product momentum but also strong discipline around costs and a focus on driving shareholder value."
Liddell, 51, joined Microsoft in May 2005 after serving as CFO at International Paper Co., and chief executive officer of Carter Holt Harvey Ltd, then New Zealand's second largest listed company. He said he is looking at a number of opportunities that will expand his career beyond being a CFO.
Liddell will continue at Microsoft working closely with Klein through December 31, to ensure a smooth transition.
Before to joining Microsoft, Klein spent 13 years in corporate finance, primarily in the communications and technology sectors: McCaw Cellular Communication; Orca Bay Capital, a private equity firm; and several startups, including HomeGrocer.com, where as vice president and treasurer he helped lead an IPO and subsequent acquisition by Webvan.
"I'm honored to take on the role of Microsoft CFO. I've learned a lot working with Chris, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead for Microsoft," said Klein. "We have an incredible pipeline of products, we have strong financial and operational accountability, and we are well-positioned for growth as the economy recovers."
Klein holds a bachelor's degree from Yale University and an MBA from the University of Washington. Outside of work, he is an avid sports fan and serves on the board of NPower Seattle, a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing the effectiveness of non-profit service providers through technology. He and his wife have two sons.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced record third-quarter revenue of $14.50 billion for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2010, a 6% increase from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $5.17 billion, $4.01 billion and $0.45 per share, which represented increases of 17%, 35% and 36%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period.
REDMOND, Wash.  Apr. 22, 2010 
The results include the deferral of $305 million of revenue relating to the Microsoft Office 2010 Technology Guarantee program. Adjusting for the revenue deferral, third-quarter revenue totaled $14.81 billion, an increase of 8% over the prior year period.
"Windows 7 continues to be a growth engine, but we also saw strong growth in other areas like Bing search, Xbox LIVE and our emerging cloud services," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Our record third-quarter revenue along with continued rigor on cost management resulted in exceptional EPS growth."
Windows revenue was up 28%, compared with the same quarter a year earlier, driven by strong demand for Windows 7. More than 10% of all PCs worldwide are running Windows 7 today, making Windows 7 by far the fastest-selling operating system in history.
"Business customers are beginning to refresh their desktops and the momentum of Windows 7 continues to be strong," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer. "We are also seeing tremendous interest in our market-leading cloud services for business."

Microsoft offers operating expense guidance of $26.1 billion to $26.3 billion for the full year ending June 30, 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
For Release 9 a.m. PDT
May 25, 2010
  Microsoft Corp. today announced that Robbie Bach, president of the Entertainment and Devices (E&D) Division, will retire from the company this fall.
REDMOND, Wash.
May 25, 2010
Underscoring the strength of the leadership teams in place for the entertainment and mobile businesses, the company announced that Senior Vice President Don Mattrick will continue to lead the Interactive Entertainment Business and Senior Vice President Andy Lees will continue to lead the Mobile Communications Business. Each will report directly to CEO Steve Ballmer effective July 1.
"For the past 22 years, Robbie has personified creativity, innovation and drive. With this spirit, he has led a division passionately devoted to making Microsoft successful in interactive entertainment and mobility," Ballmer said. "Robbie's an amazing business person and close personal friend, which makes his departure a point of sadness for me. However, given the strong leadership team he has built, the business performance of E&D this year and the launches of Windows Phone 7 and Project Natal' this fall, we are set up well for success as we continue to drive our mobile and entertainment businesses forward."
"At Microsoft, I've been so fortunate to spend more than two decades of my life working with incredible people and doing amazing things like launching Office, Xbox and Xbox Live, the
Halo' franchise, Windows Phones, Zune and more," said Bach, who joined the company in 1988. "I'm at the time in my life where I want to dedicate more time to my family and my nonprofit work, including my work with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. I have the utmost confidence in Steve, Don and Andy and their ability to see through our mission of bringing extraordinary entertainment and mobility experiences to life for people around the world."
Bach will remain with Microsoft through the fall, working with Ballmer and his leadership team to ensure a smooth transition.
Mattrick has led the Interactive Entertainment Business since July 2007, overseeing the evolution of Xbox Live, the launch of blockbusters such as "Halo 3" and the much-anticipated "Project Natal." Under Mattrick's leadership, the global Xbox installed base has grown to more than 40 million consoles and Xbox Live now has more than 23 million members. Previously, Mattrick served as president of Electronic Arts Worldwide Studios.
Microsoft also announced that David Treadwell, corporate vice president of Live Platform Services, will take a new position leading the core technology organization for the Interactive Entertainment Business, reporting to Mattrick.
Lees has led the Mobile Communications Business since February 2008 and has been instrumental in reinvigorating Microsoft's mobility efforts, bringing in new business and development talent and overseeing the creation of both KIN and Windows Phone 7. A 20-year Microsoft veteran, he previously served as corporate vice president for Server & Tools marketing and sales, led a variety of worldwide sales and marketing functions, and began his career in Microsoft's U.K. subsidiary.
"One measure of a leader is the team he assembles around him, and Robbie built an incredible team. Don and Andy are exactly the right leaders to carry our entertainment and mobility efforts forward," Ballmer said.
Microsoft also announced that J Allard, senior vice president of Design and Development for E&D, will be leaving Microsoft after 19 years, and will take an official role as an advisor in a strategic role for Ballmer and his leadership team.
"J has brought a game-changing creative magic to Microsoft for years, from Windows to Xbox, from Zune to KIN," Ballmer said. "He was one of the key drivers in our early work on the Web, and we're absolutely delighted that J's role with the company will evolve in a way that lets all of Microsoft benefit from his business insight, technical depth and keen eye for consumer experience."
In other organization moves, following the successful launch of Office 2010, Antoine Leblond, senior vice president in the Office Productivity Applications Group, will take a new role as senior vice president for the Windows Web Services team. This team brings together the integral Windows services that today deliver updates, solutions, community and depth information for the Windows consumer. Kurt DelBene, senior vice president in the Office Business Productivity Group, will take on all of the engineering responsibilities for the Office business.
Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq "MSFT") is the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential.

On June 8, 2010, Microsoft issued a press release announcing the proposed private offering of convertible senior notes due 2013. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
June 8, 2010
 Microsoft Corp. today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2013 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Microsoft expects to grant the initial purchasers a 13-day option to purchase up to $100,000,000 principal amount of additional convertible notes to cover over-allotments, if any.
REDMOND, Wash.  June 8, 2010
Prior to March 15, 2013, the convertible notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft's common stock or a combination thereof, at Microsoft's election. On or after March 15, 2013, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time.
The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms of the convertible notes will be determined by negotiations between Microsoft and the initial purchasers of the convertible notes.
In connection with the pricing of the convertible notes, Microsoft expects to enter into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers in the convertible notes offering or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes. The option counterparties have advised Microsoft that, in connection with the initial hedging by them or their respective affiliates of the capped call transactions, they expect to enter into various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to Microsoft's common stock and/or purchase shares
 
of Microsoft's common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with or following the pricing of the convertible notes, and they expect to modify their hedge positions by purchasing or selling shares of Microsoft's common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to Microsoft's common stock and/or the convertible notes during the term of the convertible notes. Any of these activities could have the effect of increasing, preventing a decline in or, in the case of any hedge modification, adversely impacting the price of Microsoft's common stock and/or the value of the convertible notes.
Microsoft expects to repurchase shares of its common stock concurrently with or following the pricing of the convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions and/or open market transactions. Any such repurchases could also affect the price of Microsoft's common stock.
Microsoft intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of convertible notes to repay short-term debt.
.
This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities. The offer and the sale of the convertible notes and the shares of common stock underlying the convertible notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and the convertible notes and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements

On June 8, 2010, Microsoft issued a press release announcing the pricing of the private offering of zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2013. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
June 8, 2010
Microsoft Corp. today announced the pricing of $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of its zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2013 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Microsoft has granted the initial purchasers a 13-day option to purchase up to $100 million principal amount of additional convertible notes to cover over-allotments, if any.
REDMOND, Wash.  June 8, 2010 
The convertible notes will not bear interest and the principal amount will not accrete. Prior to March 15, 2013, the convertible notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances, into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft's common stock or a combination thereof, at Microsoft's election. On or after March 15, 2013, the convertible notes will be convertible at any time.
The initial conversion rate is 29.9434 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of convertible notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $33.40 per share of common stock or a conversion premium of 33 percent based on the last reported sale price of Microsoft's common stock on June 8, 2010, of $25.11). The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in specified events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest. If Microsoft undergoes certain fundamental changes, holders may require it to repurchase the convertible notes in whole or in part for cash.
 
In connection with the pricing of the convertible notes, Microsoft entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers in the convertible notes offering or their affiliates. Under the capped call transactions, Microsoft will purchase from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the full number of shares of its common stock initially underlying the convertible notes, with a strike price initially equal to the initial conversion price of the convertible notes and with a cap price initially equal to $37.16 or approximately 48 percent above the last reported sale price of Microsoft's common stock on June 8, 2010, of $25.11 (in each case subject to certain anti-dilutive or anti-concentrative adjustments). The capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes, subject to the cap price. The capped call transactions will generally have the economic effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the convertible notes to that of the cap price.
The option counterparties have advised Microsoft that, in connection with the initial hedging by them or their respective affiliates of the capped call transactions, they have entered into various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to Microsoft's common stock and/or purchased shares of Microsoft's common stock in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the pricing of the convertible notes, and they expect to modify their hedge positions by purchasing or selling shares of Microsoft's common stock in open market transactions and/or privately negotiated transactions and/or entering into or unwinding various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to Microsoft's common stock and/or the convertible notes during the term of the convertible notes. Any of these activities could have the effect of increasing, preventing a decline in or, in the case of any hedge modification activities, adversely impacting the price of Microsoft's common stock and/or the value of the convertible notes.
Microsoft has repurchased shares of its common stock concurrently with the pricing of the convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions, and may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions following the pricing of the convertible notes. Any such repurchases could also affect the price of Microsoft's common stock.
 
Microsoft will use the net proceeds from the offering of convertible notes to repay short-term debt.
The sale of the convertible notes is expected to close on June 14, 2010, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities. The offer and the sale of the convertible notes and the shares of common stock underlying the convertible notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and the convertible notes and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On June 14, 2010, Microsoft Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Indenture, dated as of June 14, 2010 (the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"), under which the Company issued $1,250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"). A form of the Indenture is set forth as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Notes will not bear interest, and the principal amount will not accrete. The Notes will mature on June 15, 2013. The Company will pay special interest under specified circumstances and relating to certain failures to comply with its reporting obligations. Special interest, if any, will be payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year.
Holders may convert their Notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2013 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2010 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 95% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 15, 2013 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being converted, determined in the manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Company may not redeem the Notes and no sinking fund is provided for the Notes. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require the Company to repurchase the Notes in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
plus
The Notes and common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any state securities laws. The Notes were offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act).
In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes or their affiliates (in such capacity, collectively, the "option counterparties"). Under the capped call transactions, the Company purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the full number of shares of the Company's common stock initially underlying the Notes, with a strike price initially equal to the initial conversion price of the Notes and with a cap price initially equal to approximately $37.16 (or approximately 48% higher than the last reported sale price per share of the Company's common stock on June 8, 2010 of $25.11), in each case subject to certain anti-dilutive or anti-concentrative adjustments. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes, subject to the cap price. The capped call transactions will generally have the economic effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the notes to that of the cap price.
The foregoing summary of the Indenture (including the Form of the Notes) is qualified in its entirety by the terms the Indenture. Please refer to the Indenture (including the Form of Notes), which is incorporated herein by reference, and a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(iv) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel; and
(b) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the principal (including the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of and any Special Interest on the Notes that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 4.12.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

On the 180th day after such event (if the event that would otherwise constitute an Event of Default relating to the Company's reporting obligations under Section 11.06(b) is not cured or waived prior to such 180th day), the Notes will be subject to acceleration as provided in Section 4.02(a). Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall affect the rights of Holders of Notes in the event of the occurrence of any other Event of Default. In the event the Company does not elect to pay Special Interest following such event in accordance with this paragraph, the Notes shall be immediately subject to acceleration as provided in Section 4.02(a).

The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
Section 4.10No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Notes to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein.

If the Company is not then acting as the Bid Solicitation Agent, the Company shall provide written notice to the Bid Solicitation Agent of the three independent nationally recognized securities dealers selected by the Company pursuant to the definition of Trading Price, along with appropriate contact information for each. The Bid Solicitation Agent (if other than the Company) shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes unless the Company has requested such determination; and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request (or, if the Company is acting as Bid Solicitation Agent, the Company shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes) unless a Holder of a Note provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes would be less than 95% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock and the Conversion Rate.

Once the Company has given such notice, the Notes may be surrendered for conversion at any time until the earlier of (1) the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding such Ex-Dividend Date and (2) the Company's announcement that such issuance or distribution will not take place, even if the Notes are not otherwise convertible at such time. Holders, however, may not convert their Notes if provision is made for Holders of the Notes to participate, at the same time and upon the same terms, as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the transactions described above without having to convert their Notes as if they held a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate multiplied by the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holders.

(c) The Settlement Amount shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last Trading Day of the Observation Period. Promptly after such determination of the Settlement Amount, the Company shall notify the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of the Settlement Amount. The Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) shall have no responsibility for any such determination.
(d) The Company shall not issue any fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion based on the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock on the last Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period.
(e) Before any Holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such Holder shall (i) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to the Special Interest, if any, payable on the next Special Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 12.02(h) and, if required, pay taxes or duties, if any, as required by Section 12.02(f) and (ii) in the case of a Physical Note (1) complete and manually sign a notice in the form of the Form of Notice of Conversion (or a facsimile thereof) (a ""), (2) deliver such notice, which is irrevocable, and such Physical Note, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank, at the office of the Conversion Agent, (3) if required, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, (4) if required, pay all transfer or similar taxes, if any, as required by Section 12.02(f) and (5) if required, pay funds equal to the Special Interest, if any, payable on the next Special Interest Payment Date to which such Holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 12.02(h). The Trustee (and, if different, the Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 12 on the Conversion Date for such conversion. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the Holder has complied with the relevant procedures in the immediately preceding sentence.

any service charge by the converting Holder but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, duty or similar charge required by law that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such conversion being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such conversion.

The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
(h) Upon conversion, a Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid Special Interest, if any, except as set forth below.

As a result, accrued and unpaid Special Interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes into a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, accrued and unpaid Special Interest, if any, shall be deemed to be paid first out of the cash paid upon such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date for the payment of Special Interest, Holders of such Notes at the close of business on such Regular Record Date shall receive the Special Interest, if any, payable on such Notes on the corresponding Special Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding Special Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of Special Interest, if any, payable on the Notes so converted; that no such payment need be made (1) for conversions following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Special Interest Payment Date; or (3) to the extent of any overdue Special Interest, if any overdue Special Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.

(c) The number of Additional Shares, if any, by which the Conversion Rate is increased in connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change shall be determined by reference to the table below, based on the date on which the Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (as used in such table, the "") and the price (as used in such table, the "") paid (or deemed to be paid) per share of the Common Stock in the Make-Whole Fundamental Change. If the holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in a Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share, in which case the cash due upon conversion shall be paid to Holders on the third Scheduled Trading Day following the Conversion Date. Otherwise, the Stock Price shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Effective Date of the Make-Whole Fundamental Change.

(ii) if the Stock Price is greater than $60.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate; and
(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $25.11 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Rate exceed 39.8247 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 12.04.

(a) If the Company exclusively issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of its Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 12.04(a) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the opening of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 12.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. For purposes of this Section 12.04(a), the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution shall not include the Company's shares of Common Stock held by it in treasury, if any. The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on the Common Stock held in treasury, if any.
(b) If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
 
where,
 
Any increase made under this Section 12.04(b) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance. To the extent such rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration or termination, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date of such expiration or termination, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make such issuance, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance had not occurred.
For purposes of this Section 12.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance shall not include the Company's shares of Common Stock held in treasury, if any. The Company shall not issue any such rights, options or warrants in respect of the Company's Common Stock held in treasury, if any.
 
(c) If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property of its or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock, or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding: (i) dividends, distributions, rights, options or warrants as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 12.04(a) or Section 12.04(b), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash, (iii) dividends or distributions that constitute Reference Property following a Merger Event pursuant to Section 12.06; and (iv) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 12.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock, or other securities of the Company, the ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
where,
 
If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 12.04(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the closing sale prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), then, for purposes of the adjustment above, "FMV" shall be deemed to be $0.01 less than SP
0
and, in addition to the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock receive the Distributed Property, an amount of Distributed Property equal in value and proportionate in kind to the distribution
 
that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution less the deemed "FMV".
Any increase made under the portion of this Section 12.04(c) above shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make such distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such distribution had not been declared.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 12.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, where such Capital Stock or similar equity interest is listed or quoted (or will be listed or quoted upon consummation of the spin-off) on a national securities exchange (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where,
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph of this Section 12.04(c) shall be determined on the last day of the Valuation Period, but will be given effect as of the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off. If the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off is less than 10 Trading Days prior to, and including, the end of the Observation Period in respect of any conversion, references within the portion of this Section 12.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced, for purposes of calculating the Conversion Rate in respect of that conversion, with such lesser number of Trading Days as have
 
elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for the Spin-Off to, and including, the last Trading Day of such Observation Period. For purposes of determining the Conversion Rate, in respect of any conversion during the 10 Trading Days commencing on the Ex-Dividend Date for any Spin-Off, references within the portion of this Section 12.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, but excluding, the relevant Conversion Date. In the event that such Spin-Off described in the preceding paragraph of this Section 12.04(c) is not so made, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors publicly announces its decision not to effect such Spin-Off, to be the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect if such Spin-Off had not been declared.
For purposes of this Section 12.04(c) (and subject in all respect to Section 12.09), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 12.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 12.04(c) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 12.04(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and the Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 12.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
 
For purposes of Section 12.04(a), Section 12.04(b) and this Section 12.04(c), if any dividend or distribution to which this Section 12.04(c) is applicable also includes one or both of:
(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 12.04(a) is applicable (the ""); or
Clause A Distribution
(B) a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 12.04(b) is applicable (the ""),
Clause B Distribution
then (1) such dividend or distribution, other than the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution, shall be deemed to be a dividend or distribution to which this Section 12.04(c) is applicable (the "") and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 12.04(c) with respect to such Clause C Distribution shall then be made, and (2) the Clause A Distribution and Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to immediately follow the Clause C Distribution and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 12.04(a) and Section 12.04(b) with respect thereto shall then be made, except that, if determined by the Company (I) the "Ex-Dividend Date" of the Clause A Distribution and the Clause B Distribution shall be deemed to be the Ex-Dividend Date of the Clause C Distribution and (II) any shares of Common Stock included in the Clause A Distribution or Clause B Distribution shall be deemed not to be "outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on such Ex-Dividend Date or effective date" within the meaning of Section 12.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the opening of business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of Section 12.04(b).
Clause C Distribution
(d) If the Company pays or makes any cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, other than (i) a regular, quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $0.13 per share (the ""), (ii) cash dividends or distributions made in connection with the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding-up and (iii) dividends or distributions that constitute Reference Property following a Merger Event pursuant to Section 12.06, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Initial Dividend Threshold
 
where,
 
 
The Initial Dividend Threshold shall be subject to adjustment in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate; that no adjustment shall be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 12.04(d).
provided
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), then, for purposes of the adjustment above, "C" shall be deemed to be $0.01 less than "SP
0
" and, in addition to the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of the Common Stock, an amount of cash equal in value to the dividend that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution less the deemed "C".
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 12.04(d) shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
(e) In addition to those adjustments required by subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 12.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to either of the preceding two sentences, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register a notice of the increase at least one day prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 12, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan;
 
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
(iv) solely for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
(v) for accrued and unpaid Special Interest, if any.
(g) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 12 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000th) of a share. No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate. If the adjustment is not made because the adjustment does not change the Conversion Rate by 1% or more, then the adjustment that is not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any future adjustment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such carried-forward adjustments shall be made with respect to affected Notes (i) on the Conversion Date for any Notes and any Trading Day in the related Observation Period and (ii) on each of the 10 consecutive Trading Days beginning on, and including, the 12th Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
(h) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent if not the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officer's Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at its last address appearing on the Note Register of this Indenture. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
(i) For purposes of this Section 12.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company so long as the Company does not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company, but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
 
(j) Notwithstanding the above set forth in this Section 12.04 and Section 12.03, in the event of an increase in the Conversion Rate above that which would result in the Notes, in the aggregate, becoming convertible into shares of Common Stock in excess of limitations set forth in the listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company shall, at its option, either obtain stockholder approval of such issuances or pay cash in lieu of any shares otherwise deliverable upon conversions in excess of such limitations based on the Daily VWAP of the Common Stock on each Trading Day of the relevant Observation Period in respect of which, in lieu of delivering the Common Stock, the Company is paying cash pursuant to this subsection.
Section 12.05Whenever any provision of this Indenture requires the Company to calculate the Last Reported Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values over a span of multiple days (including an Observation Period and the period for determining the Stock Price for purposes of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change), the Company shall make appropriate adjustments to each to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which such Last Reported Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Settlement Amounts or the Daily Conversion Values are to be calculated.
. Adjustments of Prices.
Section 12.06. . (a) In the case of:
Effect of Recapitalizations, Reclassifications and Changes of the Common Stock
(i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than changes resulting from a subdivision or combination),
(ii) any consolidation, merger or combination involving the Company,
(iii) any sale, lease or other transfer to a third party of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries, or
(iv) any binding share exchange,
in each case, as a result of which the Common Stock would be converted into, or exchanged for, stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) (any such event, a ""), then (x) at and after the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed into a right to convert such principal amount of the Notes into the kind and amount of shares of stock, other securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such Merger Event would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "", with each "" meaning the kind and amount of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock is entitled to receive) upon such Merger Event and (y) prior to or at the effective time of such Merger Event, the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture permitted under Section 10.01(m) providing for such change in the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes. However, at and after the effective time of the Merger Event:
Merger Event
Reference Property
unit of Reference Property
(i) the amount otherwise payable in cash upon conversion of the Notes as set forth under Section 12.02(a) above shall continue to be payable in cash;
 
(ii) the Company shall continue to have the right to elect to determine the form of consideration to be paid or delivered, as the case may be, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its Conversion Obligation in excess of the principal amount of the Notes being converted as set forth under Section 12.02(a);
(iii) the number of shares of the Common Stock, if any, otherwise deliverable upon conversion of the Notes as set forth under Section 12.02(a) above shall instead be deliverable in the amount and type of Reference Property that a holder of that number of shares of the Common Stock would have received in such Merger Event; and
(iv) the Daily VWAP shall be calculated based on the value of a unit of Reference Property that a holder of one share of the Common Stock would have received in such Merger Event.
For purposes of the foregoing, if the Merger Event causes the Common Stock to be converted into, or exchanged for, the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election), the Reference Property used to determine the amount of cash into which the Notes will be convertible shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall notify Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
Such supplemental indenture described in the second immediately preceding paragraph shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as is possible to the adjustments provided for in this Article 12 in the judgment of the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the successor or purchasing Person. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes securities or other property or assets (including cash or any combination thereof) of a Person other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such Merger Event, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other Person and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article 13.
(b) In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 12.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officer's Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or other property or asset that will comprise the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made
 
with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders. The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at its address appearing on the Note Register provided for in this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in such Merger Event, then for all conversions that occur after the effective date of such Merger Event (i) the Settlement Amount for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes shall be an amount equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date (as may be increased by any Additional Shares pursuant to Section 12.03), the price paid per share of Common Stock in such Merger Event and (ii) the Company shall satisfy its Conversion Obligation by paying cash to converting Holders on the third Scheduled Trading Day immediately following the Conversion Date.
multiplied by
(d) The Company shall not become a party to any Merger Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section 12.06. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes as set forth in Section 12.01 and Section 12.02 prior to the effective date of such Merger Event.
(e) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
(f) In connection with any Merger Event, the Initial Dividend Threshold shall be subject to adjustment as described in clause (i), clause (ii) or clause (iii) below, as the case may be.
(i) In the case of a Merger Event in which the Reference Property (determined, as appropriate, pursuant to subsection (a) above and excluding any dissenters' appraisal rights) is composed entirely of shares of common stock (the ""), the Initial Dividend Threshold at and after the effective time of such Merger Event will be equal to (x) the Initial Dividend Threshold immediately prior to the effective time of such Merger Event, (y) the number of shares of Merger Common Stock that a holder of one share of Common Stock would receive in such Merger Event (such quotient rounded down to nearest cent).
Merger Common Stock
divided by
(ii) In the case of a Merger Event in which the Reference Property (determined, as appropriate, pursuant to subsection (a) above and excluding any dissenters' appraisal rights) is composed in part of shares of Merger Common Stock, the Initial Dividend Threshold at and after the effective time of such Merger Event will be equal to (x) the Initial Dividend Threshold immediately prior to the effective time of such Merger Event, (y) the Merger Valuation Percentage for such Merger Event (such product rounded down to nearest cent).
multiplied by
 
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a Merger Event in which the Reference Property (determined, as appropriate, pursuant to subsection (a) above and excluding any dissenters' appraisal rights) is composed entirely of consideration other than shares of common stock, the Initial Dividend Threshold at and after the effective time of such Merger Event will be equal to zero.
Section 12.07 The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine the Conversion Rate (or any adjustment thereto) or whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment (including any increase) of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any securities, property or cash that may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 12.06 relating either to the kind or amount of securities or property (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 12.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 5.01, may accept (without any independent investigation) as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officer's Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor the Conversion Agent shall be responsible for determining whether any event contemplated by Section 12.01(b) has occurred that makes the Notes eligible for conversion or no longer eligible therefor until the Company has delivered to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent the notices referred to in Section 12.01(b) with respect to the commencement or termination of such conversion rights, on which notices the Trustee and the Conversion Agent may conclusively rely, and the Company agrees to deliver such notices to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent immediately after the occurrence of any such event or at such other times as shall be provided for in Section 12.01(b).

(b) Merger Event; or
 
(c) voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
then, in each case (unless notice of such event is otherwise required pursuant to another provision of this Indenture), the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) and to be mailed to each Holder at its address appearing on the Note Register, as promptly as possible but in any event at least 20 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record are to be determined for the purposes of such action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (and the related Ex-Dividend Date), or (ii) the date on which such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such action by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, Merger Event, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
Section 12.09 To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect prior to any conversion of the Notes and the rights have separated from the shares of Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable stockholder rights plan, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock of the Company, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options or warrants as provided in Section 12.04(c), subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights.
. Stockholder Rights Plans.
Section 13.01(a) If a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to the Maturity Date, then each Holder shall have the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such Holder's Notes, or any portion of the principal amount thereof, that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, on the date (the "") specified by the Company that is not less than 20 calendar days or more than 35 calendar days following the date of the Fundamental Change Company Notice at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, accrued and unpaid Special Interest, if any, thereon to but excluding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (the ""), unless the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is after a Regular Record Date but on or prior to the Special Interest Payment Date to which such Regular Record Date relates, in which case the Company shall instead pay the full amount of accrued and unpaid Special Interest, if any, to Holders of record on such Regular Record Date and the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price shall be equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased pursuant to this Article 13.

The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of any Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal thereof.
 
(c) On or before the 20th calendar day after the occurrence of the effective date of a Fundamental Change or, if later, within two Business Days of the date upon which the Company receives notices, or becomes aware of, such transaction, the Company shall provide to all Holders of Notes, the Trustee and the Paying Agent (if other than the Trustee) a notice (the "") of the occurrence of the effective date of the Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right at the option of the Holders arising as a result thereof.

Indenture
Trustee
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, and Special Interest, if any, on, all Notes may be declared due and payable, by either the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then Outstanding, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions and certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of (a) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and (b) the principal amount on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the Holder who surrenders a Note to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, and in certain other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as described therein. The Indenture also provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences.

Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Holder has the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all of such Holder's Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date at a price equal to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price.

Summary
 
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Revenue increased mainly due to strong sales of Windows 7 and the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which were released in fiscal year 2010, and PC market improvement. Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses.
 
 
 
 
Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380 million shares during fiscal year 2010.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Revenue increased mainly due to strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses.
 
 
 
 
Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting increased net income and the repurchase of 380 million shares during fiscal year 2010.
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is presented separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the segment level during the current period.
Windows & Windows Live Division
 
Windows & Windows Live Division ("Windows Division") offerings consist of premium and standard edition Windows operating systems and online software and services through Windows Live. Premium Windows operating systems are those that include additional functionality and are sold at a price above our standard editions. Premium editions include Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate, and Windows Vista Enterprise. Standard editions include Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows Vista Starter, Windows Vista Home Basic, and Windows XP Home. Windows Live primarily generates revenue from online advertising.
Windows Division revenue growth is largely correlated to the growth of PC purchases from original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for approximately 80% of total Windows Division revenue. The remaining approximately 20% of Windows Division revenue ("other revenue") is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Windows Division revenue increased due to strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 22% to 24%. OEM revenue increased $1.1 billion or 46%, while OEM license units increased 26%. The OEM revenue increase was driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across business and consumer segments and the mix of versions of Windows licensed, partially offset by PC market strength in emerging markets versus developed markets. Prior year OEM revenue reflects $273 million of revenue deferred in connection with sales of Windows Vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to Windows 7 at minimal or no cost upon general availability. Other revenue increased $262 million or 36% driven primarily by commercial and retail sales of Windows 7.
Windows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Research and development expenses increased $89 million or 38%, reflecting capitalization of certain software development costs related to Windows 7 product development in the prior year. Cost of revenue increased $83 million or 24%, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and royalties. Sales and marketing expenses increased $77 million or 12% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Windows Division revenue increased primarily as a result of strong sales of Windows 7 and PC market improvement. We estimate total PC shipments from all sources grew approximately 16% to 18%. OEM revenue increased $2.6 billion or 22%, while OEM license units increased 21%. The OEM revenue increase was driven by PC market growth, higher Windows attach rates across consumer and business segments, the restoration of normal OEM inventory levels, and the mix of versions of Windows licensed, offset in part by PC market changes,
including stronger growth of emerging markets versus developed markets and of consumer PCs versus business PCs. Prior year OEM revenue reflects the $273 million revenue deferral discussed above. This amount was subsequently recognized in fiscal year 2010. Other revenue increased $912 million or 29% driven primarily by Windows 7 retail sales.
Windows Division operating income increased as a result of increased revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $296 million or 22%, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs, royalties and other product costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $256 million or 11% reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7.
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools licenses products, applications, tools, content, and delivers Enterprise Services, all of which are designed to make information technology professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings consist of Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure and other cloud and server offerings. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server product offerings can be run on-site, in a partner-hosted environment, or in a Microsoft-hosted environment. We use multiple sales channels, including pre-installed OEM versions, sales through partners and sales directly to end customers. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes from annuity volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in product revenue and Enterprise Services revenue. Product revenue increased $463 million or 17%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server and Enterprise CAL Suites revenue, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Enterprise Services revenue grew $21 million or 3%, primarily due to growth in Premier product support services, offset in part by decreased consulting services.
Server and Tools revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $70 million.
Server and Tools operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by increased operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $72 million or 11%, reflecting increased services costs and online and product costs. Sales and marketing expenses increased $55 million or 5%, primarily due to increased corporate and partner marketing expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $29 million.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Server and Tools revenue increased mainly reflecting growth in product revenue. Product revenue increased $652 million or 6%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server and Enterprise CAL Suites revenue, reflecting increased revenue from annuity volume licensing agreements and continued adoption of Windows platform applications, offset in part by a decline in developer tools revenue. Enterprise Services revenue was relatively flat, with growth in Premier product support services nearly offset by decreased consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth and reduced research and development expenses, offset in part by increased cost of revenue. Research and development expenses decreased $38 million or 2%, primarily driven by reduced third-party development and programming costs and headcount-related expenses, offset in part by increased hosting, localization and lab costs. Cost of revenue increased $25 million.
Online Services Division
 
Online Services Division ("OSD") consists of an online advertising platform with offerings for both publishers and advertisers, online information offerings, such as Bing, and the MSN portals and channels around the world. We earn revenue primarily from online advertising, including search, display, and advertiser and publisher tools. Revenue is also generated through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services and from MSN narrowband Internet access subscribers ("Access").
Yahoo! Commercial Agreement
On December 4, 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites. We believe this agreement will allow us over time to improve the effectiveness and increase the value of our search offering through greater scale in search queries and an expanded and more competitive search and advertising marketplace.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
OSD revenue increased primarily as a result of increased online advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased Access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $79 million or 19% to $494 million, reflecting higher search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased advertiser and publisher tools revenue. Access revenue decreased $14 million or 33%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.
OSD operating loss increased due to increased cost of revenue and research and development expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $157 million, primarily driven by Yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs, as well as online traffic acquisition costs. Research and development expenses increased $39 million or 14%, also primarily due to Yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs and third-party development and programming costs.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
OSD revenue increased reflecting increased online advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased Access revenue. Online advertising revenue increased $146 million or 8% to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased advertiser and publisher tools revenue. Access revenue decreased $57 million or 31%, reflecting continued migration of subscribers to broadband or other competitively-priced service providers.
OSD operating loss increased due to increased operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $565 million, primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs and Yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs. General and administrative expenses increased $136 million due mainly to transition expenses associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. Sales and marketing expenses increased $56 million or 5% due mainly to increased marketing of Bing, offset in part by decreased headcount-related expenses.
Microsoft Business Division
 
Microsoft Business Division ("MBD") offerings consist of the Microsoft Office system and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. Microsoft Office system products are designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity through a range of programs, services, and software solutions. Microsoft Office system offerings generate over 90% of MBD revenue. Microsoft Dynamics products provide business solutions for financial management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and mid-size businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. We evaluate our results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Consumer revenue increased $357 million or 51% due to sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system and growth in the PC market. Business revenue increased $326 million or 8%, primarily reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year licensing revenue and a 4% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue.
MBD revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $108 million.
MBD operating income increased due mainly to increased revenue, offset in part by increased operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $67 million or 6%, primarily driven by an increase in corporate marketing activities. Cost of revenue increased $63 million or 21%, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services. These increases were offset in part by a $22 million decrease in research and development expenses.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
MBD revenue decreased primarily as a result of the net deferral of $254 million of revenue related to eligible sales of the 2007 Microsoft Office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the 2010 Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost (the "Office 2010 Deferral"). Consumer revenue decreased $166 million or 5%, primarily due to the Office 2010 Deferral, offset in part by growth in the PC market and sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was launched during the fourth quarter. Business revenue decreased $102 million or 1%, primarily reflecting a decline in licensing of the 2007 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, offset in part by growth in multi-year volume licensing agreement revenue and licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers. Microsoft Dynamics revenue remained flat.
MBD operating income increased due mainly to decreased operating expenses, offset in part by decreased revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $266 million or 6%, primarily driven by a decrease in corporate marketing activities. Research and development expenses decreased $187 million or 11%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs and lower headcount-related expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased $53 million or 18% primarily due to expenses in the prior year associated with the acquisition of Fast Search & Transfer ASA and lower headcount-related expenses. These decreases were offset in part by a $126 million or 11% increase in cost of revenue, primarily driven by increased traffic acquisition costs and increased costs of providing services.
Entertainment and Devices Division
 
Entertainment and Devices Division ("EDD") offerings include the Xbox 360 platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), the Zune digital music and entertainment platform ("Zune"), PC software games, online games and services, Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), the Microsoft Surface computing platform, Windows Mobile and Embedded device platforms, application software for Apple's Macintosh computers, Microsoft PC hardware products, and other devices. EDD is also responsible for all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office and Windows operating systems.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
EDD revenue increased reflecting an increase in Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue and increased revenue from the non-gaming portion of the business. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue increased $228 million or 30%, primarily reflecting increased Xbox 360 consoles sold and increased Xbox LIVE revenue, partially offset by decreased revenue per console. We shipped 1.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, compared with 1.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Non-gaming revenue increased $115 million or 23%, primarily reflecting increased sales of Windows Embedded device platforms.
EDD revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 included a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of $52 million.
EDD operating loss increased primarily reflecting increased operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue increased $251 million or 38% primarily from charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone and increased royalty costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sales. Sales and marketing expenses increased $73 million or 29% primarily due to increased Xbox 360 platform marketing activities. Research and development expenses increased $48 million or 10%, primarily reflecting increased third-party development and programming costs and increased headcount-related expenses.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
EDD revenue was nearly flat reflecting increased revenue from the non-gaming portion of the business, partially offset by decreased revenue from Xbox 360 platform and PC games. Non-gaming revenue increased $35 million or 1% primarily reflecting increased sales of Windows Embedded device platforms, offset in part by decreased Zune and Windows Mobile revenue. Xbox 360 platform and PC game revenue decreased $12 million, primarily reflecting a reduction in Xbox 360 consoles sold and revenue per console, offset in part by increased Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 10.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fiscal year 2010, compared with 11.2 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2009.
EDD operating income increased due to reduced operating expenses. Cost of revenue decreased $528 million or 11%, primarily due to lower Xbox 360 console costs, offset in part by increased royalty costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sales and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone. Research and development expenses decreased $34 million or 2%, primarily reflecting decreased third-party development and programming costs.
Corporate-Level Activity
 
Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product support services; human resources; legal; finance; information technology; corporate development and procurement activities; research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and employee severance.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Corporate-level expenses decreased due mainly to a reduction in legal charges and employee severance charges, offset in part by increased costs associated with broad-based sales and marketing activities. Legal charges were approximately $97 million compared to $193 million in the prior year.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Corporate-level expenses decreased due mainly to employee severance charges of $330 million incurred in the prior year, decreased partner payments, and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts. These decreases in expenses were offset in part by an increase in legal charges and costs associated with broad-based sales and marketing activities. Legal charges were approximately $533 million compared to $283 million in the prior year.
Cost of Revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space ("traffic acquisition costs"); costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs.
Cost of revenue increased reflecting higher online costs, mainly Yahoo! reimbursement and implementation costs and traffic acquisition costs, as well as increased royalty costs resulting from increased Xbox LIVE digital marketplace third-party content sales and charges resulting from the discontinuation of the KIN phone. For the full fiscal year, these costs were offset in part by lower Xbox 360 console costs and reductions in other costs due to resource management efforts.
Research and Development
 
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets and the amortization of purchased software code and services content.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Research and development expenses increased, primarily reflecting the capitalization of certain software development costs related to Windows 7 product development in the prior year.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Research and development expenses decreased, primarily reflecting decreased third-party development and programming costs and the capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs. These decreases were offset in part by the capitalization of certain software and development costs related to Windows 7 product development in the prior year.
Sales and Marketing
 
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
Sales and marketing expenses increased, primarily reflecting increased advertising and marketing of Windows 7 and Bing and increased sales force expenses related to Windows 7.
General and Administrative
 
General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense and other headcount-related expenses associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources and other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees.
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
General and administrative expenses decreased in nearly all expense categories, including decreased legal charges and a 4% reduction in headcount-related expenses.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
General and administrative expenses increased due to increased legal charges, as discussed above within Corporate-Level Activity, and transition expenses associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. These increases were offset in part by a 6% reduction in headcount-related expenses.
Employee Severance
In January 2009, we announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce employee headcount. We completed this program in fiscal year 2010, reducing our overall headcount by approximately 5,300 in various functions, including research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources, and information technology. During fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we recorded employee severance expense of $59 million and $330 million, respectively.
Other Income (Expense)
The components of other income (expense) were as follows:
 
 
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our issuance of long-term debt in May 2009. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments and higher gains on sales of investments in the current period as compared to the prior period. Other-than-temporary impairments were $33 million during the three months ended June 30, 2010, as compared with $108 million during the three months ended June 30, 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on commodity, equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to gains in the prior period and higher losses on foreign currency contracts in the current period.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed-income investments. Interest expense increased due to our issuance of long term debt in May 2009. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by lower gains on sales of investments in the current period. Other-than-temporary impairments were $69 million during fiscal year 2010, as compared with $862 million during fiscal year 2009 and decreased primarily due to improvements in market conditions. Net losses on derivatives decreased due to gains on equity and interest rate derivatives as compared to losses in the prior period and lower losses on commodity and foreign currency contracts in the current period Net gains from foreign currency remeasurements were insignificant in fiscal year 2010 compared to net losses of $509 million in the prior year, which had resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the prior year. For fiscal year 2010, other includes a gain on the divestiture of Razorfish.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 25% for both the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2010, as compared with 27% for both the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2009. The fiscal year 2010 rate reflects a higher mix of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates.
Unearned revenue at June 30, 2010 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2010 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future, Xbox LIVE subscriptions; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; technology guarantee programs, including the 2010 Microsoft Office technology guarantee program; and other offerings for which we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2010:
 
Three months ended June 30, 2010 compared with three months ended June 30, 2009
Cash flow from operations increased $1.8 billion, reflecting payment of $1.0 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers due to strong sales in the current year. Cash used for financing was $4.1 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2010 as compared with cash provided by financing of $2.7 billion in the prior fiscal year. This decrease in cash flow was due to a $3.8 billion increase in stock repurchases along with a $2.9 billion decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt with maturities longer than 90 days. Cash used for investing decreased $3.7 billion due to a $6.4 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities partially offset by a $2.8 billion decrease in securities lending activities.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2010 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2009
Cash flow from operations increased $5.0 billion, primarily due to payment of $4.1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service in the prior year as a result of our settlement of the 2000-2003 audit examination along with increased cash received from customers in the current year. Cash used for financing increased $5.8 billion, primarily due to a $5.6 billion decrease in net cash proceeds from issuance and repayments of short-term and long-term debt. Financing activities also included a $1.9 billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases, which was offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in cash received from common stock issued. Cash used for investing decreased $4.5 billion due to a $3.3 billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases, sales, and maturities along with a $1.1 billion decrease in additions to property and equipment.

(e) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to the Representatives their written opinion and negative assurance letter, dated the Time of Delivery, with respect to the validity of the Indenture and the Securities, the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package, the Prospectus, and other related matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such documents and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters;

(j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery a certificate of the Company signed by an officer of the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives as to (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein as of the Time of Delivery, (ii) the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery and (iii) the matters set forth in Sections 7(b) and 7(g) hereof.
8. .

Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of, or omission or alleged omission to state, a material fact made in reliance upon and in
 
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 8(c), the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to not more than one separate local counsel in any jurisdiction in which the indemnified party requires representation by separate counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
provided
however
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in
 
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any
 
other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Defaulting Underwriters
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting

On October 28, 2010, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced record first-quarter revenue of $16.20 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010, a 25% increase from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $7.12 billion, $5.41 billion and $0.62 per share, which represented increases of 59%, 51% and 55%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period.
REDMOND, Wash.  Oct. 28, 2010 
Prior year results reflect the deferral of $1.47 billion of revenue, an impact of $0.12 of diluted earnings per share, relating to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program and sales of Windows 7 to OEMs and retailers before general availability in October 2009. Without the deferral in the prior year, first quarter growth rates for revenue and operating income were 13% and 20%, and growth in net income and earnings per share were 16% and 19%, respectively.
"This was an exceptional quarter, combining solid enterprise growth and continued strong consumer demand for Office 2010, Windows 7, and Xbox 360 consoles and games," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Our ability to grow revenue while continuing to control costs allowed us to deliver another quarter of year-over-year margin expansion."
During the quarter, Microsoft saw year-over-year growth across all business segments. Among the highlights are these:
 
 
 
 
"We are seeing improved business demand and adoption. Our enterprise agreement rates were strong, reflecting business commitment to Windows 7, Office 2010, and our server and database products," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Customer demand and excitement for our cloud and commercial online services continue to grow as demonstrated by major new customer wins this quarter for Windows Azure and by the significant customer interest in our recently announced Office 365 service."
Business Outlook
Microsoft reaffirms operating expense guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full year ending June 30, 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft_Investor_Relations_News_Release
Microsoft Corp. today announced record second-quarter revenue of $19.95 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2010. Operating income, net income and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $8.17 billion, $6.63 billion and $0.77 per share, respectively.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 27, 2011 
Prior year results reflect the recognition of $1.71 billion of deferred revenue relating to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program and sales of Windows 7 before general availability in October 2009. Second-quarter growth rates for revenue and earnings per share were 5% and 4%, respectively. Without the deferred recognition in the prior year, second-quarter growth rates for revenue and earnings per share were 15% and 28%, respectively.
 
"We are enthusiastic about the consumer response to our holiday lineup of products, including the launch of Kinect. The 8 million units of Kinect sensors sold in just 60 days far exceeded our expectations," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "The pace of business spending, combined with strong consumer demand, led to another quarter of operating margin expansion and solid earnings per share growth."
Among the factors driving Microsoft's record revenues and earnings per share was the 55% growth in revenue for the Entertainment & Devices Division, as the success of the Kinect sensor boosted sales of Xbox 360 consoles, Xbox Live subscriptions and Xbox games.
Microsoft Business Division revenue grew 24% year-over-year. Office 2010 is the fastest-selling consumer version of Office in history, with license sales over 50% ahead of Office 2007 over an equivalent period following launch.
"Business demand for our productivity and infrastructure products and cloud solutions is strong. Office had a huge quarter, exceeding everyone's expectations, and our roadmap for cloud productivity with Office 365 makes products like SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM even more attractive to our customers," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Windows 7 continues to be the fastest-growing operating system in history, and our recent System on a Chip announcement demonstrates our commitment that Windows will have the power and flexibility to run everywhere and on every device."
Among the other product and business highlights Microsoft reported in the quarter:

Adjusted Financial Results and Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we have provided certain non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company's performance. For revenue, operating income and earnings per share growth, we excluded the impact of deferred revenue recognized in the prior year fiscal quarter relating to the Windows 7 Upgrade Option program and sales of Windows 7 before general availability in October
2009. Presenting these measures without the impact of this item gives additional insight into operational performance and helps clarify trends affecting the company's business. For comparability of reporting, management considers this information in conjunction with GAAP amounts in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
To aid comparability of prior results, we have also recast certain prior period amounts within our Form 10-Q that conforms to the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance during the current fiscal year. In addition to the reconciliation in this release, our supplementary earnings slide deck at contains a reconciliation of adjusted financial results and a reconciliation between reported and recast segment results.

In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 8(c), the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to not more than one separate local counsel in any jurisdiction in which the indemnified party requires representation by separate counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
provided
however
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
 
terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Defaulting Underwriters
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal
 
amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but if for any other reason any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (ii) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is, and has been, acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company directly or indirectly, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed, or will assume, an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any similar obligation to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
Nature of Underwriters' Obligations
13. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by any Representative and may assume that such statement, request, notice or agreement has been duly authorized by such Underwriter.

14. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the addresses set forth on hereto; and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399, Attention: Corporate Vice President and Treasurer; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth on hereto, shall be provided to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced third-quarter revenue of $16.43 billion for the quarter ended Mar. 31, 2011, a 13% increase from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $5.71 billion, $5.23 billion, and $0.61 per share, which represented increases of 10%, 31%, and 36%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share included a $0.05 tax benefit primarily related to an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to settle a portion of their audit of tax years 2004 to 2006.
REDMOND, Wash.  Apr. 28, 2011 
"We delivered strong financial results despite a mixed PC environment, which demonstrates the strength and breadth of our businesses," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Consumers are purchasing Office 2010, Xbox and Kinect at tremendous rates, and businesses of all sizes are purchasing Microsoft platforms and applications."
Microsoft Business Division revenue grew 21% year-over-year. Since its release last spring, Office 2010 has become the fastest-selling version of Office in history, and the integrated innovation with SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and Dynamics CRM is driving significant growth for the division.
Server & Tools revenue grew 11% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Strong business adoption of Windows Server 2008 R2, SQL Server 2008 R2, and System Center are driving record revenue and margin expansion.
Windows 7 remains the fastest selling operating system in history with 350 million licenses sold. Revenue for the segment was down 4% in the third quarter, in line with the PC trends, excluding prior year launch impact.
Online Services Division revenue grew 14% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in search revenue. Bing's US search share increased to 13.9% this quarter.
Entertainment & Devices Division grew 60% year-over-year, fueled by Kinect for Xbox 360, the fastest-selling consumer electronics device in history, continued strong Xbox 360 console sales and growth of Xbox Live.
"We delivered strong third quarter revenue from our business customers, driven by outstanding performance from Windows Server, SQL database, SharePoint, Exchange, Lync and increasingly our cloud services," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Office had another huge quarter, again exceeding everyone's expectations, and the addition of Office 365 will make our cloud productivity solutions even more compelling. We continue to see strong adoption of our cloud-based services among the Fortune 500."
Business Outlook
Microsoft reaffirms operating expense guidance of $26.9 billion to $27.3 billion for the full year ending June 30, 2011. Microsoft also offers preliminary fiscal year 2012 operating expense guidance of 3% to 5% growth from the mid-point of fiscal year 2011 guidance, or $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion.

On May 10, 2011, Microsoft Corporation (the "Company") and Skype Global S. r.l. ("Skype") issued a joint press release announcing that the Company had entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Skype for $8.5 billion in cash. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
(d) .
Exhibits
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: May 10, 2011
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: "MSFT") and Skype Global S. r.l today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Microsoft will acquire Skype, the leading Internet communications company, for $8.5 billion in cash from the investor group led by Silver Lake. The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both Microsoft and Skype.
REDMOND, Wash., and LUXEMBOURG  May 10, 2011 
The acquisition will increase the accessibility of real-time video and voice communications, bringing benefits to both consumers and enterprise users and generating significant new business and revenue opportunities. The combination will extend Skype's world-class brand and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing Microsoft's existing portfolio of real-time communications products and services.
With 170 million connected users and over 207 billion minutes of voice and video conversations in 2010, Skype has been a pioneer in creating rich, meaningful connections among friends, families and business colleagues globally. Microsoft has a long-standing focus and investment in real-time communications across its various platforms, including Lync (which saw 30 percent revenue growth in Q3), Outlook, Messenger, Hotmail and Xbox LIVE.
Skype will support Microsoft devices like Xbox and Kinect, Windows Phone and a wide array of Windows devices, and Microsoft will connect Skype users with Lync, Outlook, Xbox Live and other communities. Microsoft will continue to invest in and support Skype clients on non-Microsoft platforms.
"Skype is a phenomenal service that is loved by millions of people around the world," said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. "Together we will create the future of real-time communications so people can easily stay connected to family, friends, clients and colleagues anywhere in the world."
Skype will become a new business division within Microsoft, and Skype CEO Tony Bates will assume the title of president of the Microsoft Skype Division, reporting directly to Ballmer.
"Microsoft and Skype share the vision of bringing software innovation and products to our customers," said Tony Bates. "Together, we will be able to accelerate Skype's plans to extend our global community and introduce new ways for everyone to communicate and collaborate," Bates said.
"Tony Bates has a great track record as a leader and will strengthen the Microsoft management team. I'm looking forward to Skype's talented global workforce bringing its insights, ideas and experience to Microsoft," Ballmer said.
Speaking on behalf of the investor group that sold Skype to Microsoft, Egon Durban, managing director of Silver Lake, said: "We are thrilled with Skype's transformation during the period of our ownership and grateful for the extraordinary commitment of its management team and employees. We are excited about Skype's long-term future with Microsoft, as it is poised to become one of the world's most dynamic and comprehensive communications platforms."
Founded in 2003, Skype was acquired by eBay in September 2005, and then acquired by an investment group led by Silver Lake in November 2009. Skype has made impressive progress over the past 18 months under Silver Lake's leadership, increasing monthly calling minutes by 150 percent, developing new revenue streams and strategic partnerships, acquiring the intellectual property powering its peer-to-peer network, and recruiting an outstanding senior management team.
Other members of the selling investor group led by Silver Lake include eBay International AG, CPP Investment Board, Joltid Limited in partnership with Europlay Capital Advisors; and Andreessen Horowitz.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The parties hope to obtain all required regulatory clearances during the course of this calendar year.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Microsoft Corp. today announced record fourth-quarter revenue of $17.37 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, an 8% increase from the same period of the prior year. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $6.17 billion, $5.87 billion, and $0.69 per share, which represented increases of 4%, 30%, and 35%, respectively, when compared with the prior year period.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jul. 21, 2011 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011, Microsoft reported record revenue of $69.94 billion, a 12% increase from the prior year. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the year were $27.16 billion, $23.15 billion, and $2.69, which represented increases of 13%, 23%, and 28%, respectively, when compared with the prior year.
"Throughout fiscal 2011, we delivered to market a strong lineup of products and services which translated into double-digit revenue growth, and operating margin expansion," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Our platform and cloud investments position us for long-term growth."
Microsoft Business Division revenue for the fourth quarter grew 7% and 16% for the full year. Office 2010 continues to be the fastest-selling version of Microsoft Office in history with over 100 million licenses sold. In June, Microsoft released Office 365 with familiar Microsoft Office collaboration and productivity tools delivered through the cloud.
Server & Tools revenue grew 12% for the fourth quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and grew 11% for the full year. Windows Server, System Center, and SQL Server continued to drive revenue growth in the segment.
Windows and Windows Live Division revenue declined 1% for the fourth quarter and revenue for the full year decreased 2%. Excluding the impact of the prior year Windows 7 launch and revenue deferral, we estimate full-year revenue growth was in line with PC market growth of 2% to 4%. Windows 7 has sold over 400 million licenses and business deployments continue to accelerate. During the quarter, Microsoft unveiled a preview of the next version of Windows, codenamed Windows 8, featuring a new user interface and application experience.
Online Services Division revenue grew 17% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year, primarily driven by increases in search revenue. Bing's U.S. search share increased 340 basis points year-over-year to 14.4% this quarter. Microsoft also released new features that incorporate the Facebook social graph to help users make better decisions based on their social connections.
Entertainment & Devices Division revenue grew 30% for the fourth quarter and 45% for the full year, due to the ongoing momentum of the console, Kinect, and Xbox Live. Xbox 360 has been the top-selling game console in the U.S. over the past twelve months. At E3 in June, Microsoft highlighted its upcoming game lineup, Xbox Live content partnerships, and enhanced content discovery using Bing and Kinect.
"A strong year of double-digit increases in revenue and earnings is a real credit to all of our Microsoft employees and partners around the world. We continue to see strong business demand across all of our products, from small businesses all the way up to the largest global enterprises," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Our move to cloud services continues with the release and momentum of Office 365 and growth in Windows Azure. We're providing our customers seamless and powerful ways to move to the cloud, and we are well positioned for the coming year."
Business Outlook
Microsoft reaffirms fiscal 2012 operating expense guidance of 3% to 5% growth from 2011, or $28.0 billion to $28.6 billion.

Summary
 
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of Server and Tools products, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, and the Xbox 360 entertainment platform. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.
Operating income increased reflecting an increase in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
 
 
Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting higher revenue, lower income tax expense, and repurchases of common stock, offset in part by higher operating expenses.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Revenue increased primarily due to strong sales of the Xbox 360 entertainment platform, the 2010 Microsoft Office system, and Server and Tools products, offset in part by lower Windows revenue. Revenue also increased due to the fiscal year 2010 deferral of $254 million of revenue from earlier versions of the Microsoft Office system sold with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the Microsoft Office system at minimal or no cost ("Office Deferral") and the subsequent recognition of the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on revenue.
Operating income increased reflecting the change in revenue, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Key changes in operating expenses were:
 
 
 
 
Diluted earnings per share increased reflecting higher revenue, repurchases of common stock, and lower income tax expense, offset in part by higher operating expenses.
The revenue and operating income (loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the segments. Certain corporate-level activity has been excluded from our segment operating results and is presented separately. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the way we internally managed and monitored performance at the segment level during the current period, including moving Microsoft's PC hardware business from Entertainment and Devices Division to Windows & Windows Live Division, Windows Embedded from Entertainment and Devices Division to Server and Tools, and Office for Mac from Entertainment and Devices Division to Microsoft Business Division, as well as implementing intersegment cost allocations between all segments related to the collaborative investment in mobile platform development.
Windows & Windows Live Division
 
Windows & Windows Live Division ("Windows Division") develops and markets PC operating systems, related software and online services, and PC hardware products. This collection of software, hardware, and services is designed to simplify everyday tasks through efficient browsing capabilities and seamless operations across the user's hardware and software. Windows Division offerings consist of multiple editions of the Windows operating system, software and services through Windows Live, and Microsoft PC hardware products.
Windows Division revenue is largely correlated to the PC market worldwide, as approximately 75% of total Windows Division revenue comes from Windows operating system software purchased by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") which they pre-install on equipment they sell. The remaining approximately 25% of Windows Division revenue ("other revenue") is generated by commercial and retail sales of Windows and PC hardware products and online advertising from Windows Live.
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
Windows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 8% this quarter and sales of PCs to consumers declined approximately 2%. The decline in consumer PC sales included an approximately 41% decline in the sales of netbooks. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 1% to 3%. Revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower recognition of previously deferred Windows XP revenue. This quarter, we experienced increased attachment of Windows to PCs shipped, particularly in emerging markets.
Windows Division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $52 million or 7% reflecting increased advertising of Windows and Windows Live.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Windows Division revenue reflected relative performance in PC market segments. We estimate that sales of PCs to businesses grew approximately 11% this year and sales of PCs to consumers declined approximately 1%. The decline in consumer PC sales included an approximately 32% decline in the sales of netbooks. Taken together, the total PC market increased an estimated 2% to 4%. Revenue was negatively impacted by the effect of higher growth in emerging markets, where average selling prices are lower, relative to developed markets, and by lower
recognition of previously deferred Windows XP revenue. Considering the impact of Windows 7 launch in the prior year, including $273 million of revenue recognized related to the Windows 7 Deferral, we estimate that Windows Division revenue was in line with the PC market.
Windows Division operating income decreased as a result of decreased revenue and higher sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $224 million or 8% reflecting increased advertising of Windows and Windows Live.
Server and Tools
 
Server and Tools develops and markets technology and related services that enable information technology professionals and their systems to be more productive and efficient. Server and Tools product and service offerings include Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Azure, Visual Studio, System Center products, Windows Embedded device platforms, and Enterprise Services. Enterprise Services comprise Premier product support services and Microsoft Consulting Services. We also offer developer tools, training and certification. Approximately 50% of Server and Tools revenue comes primarily from multi-year volume licensing agreements, approximately 30% is purchased through transactional volume licensing programs, retail packaged product and licenses sold to OEMs, and the remainder comes from Enterprise Services.
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product sales and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $382 million or 11%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server, and Enterprise Client Access License ("CAL") Suites, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Enterprise Services revenue grew $112 million or 14%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $149 million or 13% reflecting increased corporate marketing activities and fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors. Cost of revenue increased $133 million or 18%, primarily reflecting a $114 million increase in expenses from providing Enterprise Services.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Server and Tools revenue increased reflecting growth in both product sales and Enterprise Services. Product revenue increased $1.4 billion or 11%, driven primarily by growth in Windows Server, SQL Server, Enterprise CAL Suites, and Windows Embedded, reflecting continued adoption of Windows platform applications. Enterprise Services revenue grew $337 million or 11%, due to growth in both Premier product support and consulting services.
Server and Tools operating income increased due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $366 million or 13%, primarily reflecting a $323 million increase in expenses from providing Enterprise Services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $264 million or 6% reflecting increased fees paid to third party enterprise software advisors and increased corporate marketing activities.
Online Services Division
 
Online Services Division ("OSD") develops and markets information and content designed to help people simplify tasks and make more informed decisions online, and that help advertisers connect with audiences. OSD offerings include Bing, MSN, adCenter, and advertiser tools. Bing and MSN generate revenue through the sale of search and display advertising. Search and display advertising generally accounts for over 85% of OSD's annual revenue.
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
OSD revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. Online advertising revenue grew $100 million or 20% to $597 million, reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth, relative share gains in the U.S, and our Yahoo! alliance, offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adCenter platform for the new mix and volume of traffic from the combined Yahoo! and Bing properties. As of June 30, 2011, according to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share grew over 31% to approximately 14%, while Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 27%.
OSD operating loss increased due to higher cost of revenue, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue grew $165 million, driven by costs associated with the Yahoo! search agreement and increased traffic acquisition costs.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
OSD revenue increased primarily as a result of growth in online advertising revenue. Online advertising revenue grew $358 million or 19% to $2.3 billion, reflecting continued growth in search and display advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased third party advertising revenue. Search revenue grew due to increased volumes reflecting general market growth, relative share gains in the U.S., and our Yahoo! alliance, offset in part by decreased revenue per search primarily related to challenges associated with optimizing the adCenter platform for the new mix and volume of traffic from the combined Yahoo! and Bing properties. As of June 30, 2011, according to third-party sources, Bing organic U.S. market share grew over 31% to approximately 14%, while Bing-powered U.S. market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 27%.
OSD operating loss increased due to higher operating expenses, offset in part by increased revenue. Cost of revenue grew $641 million driven by costs associated with the Yahoo! search agreement and increased traffic acquisition costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $157 million or 60% due mainly to transition expenses in the prior year associated with the inception of the Yahoo! Commercial Agreement. Research and development increased $117 million or 11% due to increased headcount-related costs.
Microsoft Business Division
 
Microsoft Business Division ("MBD") develops and markets software and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. MBD offerings include the Microsoft Office system (comprising mainly Office, SharePoint, Exchange and Lync), which generates over 90% of MBD revenue, and Microsoft Dynamics business solutions. We evaluate MBD results based upon the nature of the end user in two primary parts: business
revenue, which includes Microsoft Office system revenue generated through volume licensing agreements and Microsoft Dynamics revenue; and consumer revenue, which includes revenue from retail packaged product sales and OEM revenue.
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
MBD revenue increased reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, which was released primarily during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Consumer revenue decreased $93 million or 8%, primarily driven by a decline in consumer PC sales in developed markets. Business revenue increased $494 million or 12%, primarily reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 19% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue.
MBD operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth as well as decreased sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $74 million or 6%, due mainly to decreased advertising and marketing activities. Cost of revenue increased $83 million or 22%, primarily driven by higher online costs and services.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
MBD revenue increased primarily reflecting sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system, the $254 million Office Deferral during fiscal year 2010, and the subsequent recognition of the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2011. Business revenue increased $2.0 billion or 13%, reflecting licensing of the 2010 Microsoft Office system to transactional business customers, growth in multi-year volume licensing revenue, and a 10% increase in Microsoft Dynamics revenue. Consumer revenue increased $1.1 billion or 33%, approximately half of which was attributable to the launch of Office 2010 and half of which was attributable to the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2010 and subsequent recognition of the Office Deferral during fiscal year 2011. Excluding the impact associated with the Office Deferral, consumer revenue increased $620 million or 17% due to sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
MBD operating income increased due mainly to revenue growth, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Cost of revenue increased $335 million or 26%, primarily driven by higher online costs and services. Sales and marketing expenses increased $97 million or 2%, primarily driven by an increase in corporate and cross-platform marketing activities. Research and development costs increased $79 million or 4%, primarily as a result of capitalization of certain Microsoft Office system software development costs in the prior year.
Entertainment and Devices Division
 
 
Entertainment and Devices Division ("EDD") develops and markets products and services designed to entertain and connect people. EDD offerings include the Xbox 360 entertainment platform (which includes the Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360, Xbox 360 video games, Xbox LIVE, and Xbox 360 accessories), Mediaroom (our Internet protocol television software), and Windows Phone. In November 2010, we released Kinect for Xbox 360 and the latest version of Windows Phone.
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $293 million or 29%, led by higher Xbox LIVE revenue and increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles sold. We shipped 1.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, compared with 1.5 million Xbox 360 consoles during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
EDD operating income increased primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $118 million or 15% primarily reflecting higher volumes of Xbox 360 consoles, and increased royalty costs resulting from increased sales of Xbox LIVE digital content.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
EDD revenue increased primarily reflecting higher Xbox 360 platform revenue. Xbox 360 platform revenue grew $2.7 billion or 48%, led by increased volumes of Xbox 360 consoles, sales of Kinect sensors, and higher Xbox LIVE revenue. We shipped 13.7 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2011, compared with 10.3 million Xbox 360 consoles during fiscal year 2010.

Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Corporate-level expenses increased due mainly to new Puerto Rican excise taxes, certain revenue related sales and marketing expenses, and increased headcount-related expenses. These increases were offset in part by lower legal charges, which were $332 million in fiscal year 2011 compared to $533 million in fiscal year 2010.
Cost of Revenue
 
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our Web sites, and to acquire online advertising space ("traffic acquisition costs"); costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs.
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010

Other Income (Expense)
The components of other income (expense) were as follows:

Dividends and interest income increased due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of fixed-income and equity securities. Derivative losses decreased due primarily to lower losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign
currency revenues and interest-rate and equity derivatives, offset in part by higher losses on commodity derivatives.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Dividends and interest income increased due to higher average portfolio investment balances, offset in part by lower yields on our fixed income investments. Interest expense increased due to our increased issuance of debt. Net recognized gains on investments increased due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity securities, offset in part by fewer gains on sales of fixed-income securities. Derivative losses decreased due primarily to higher gains on commodity derivatives offset in part by higher losses on currency contracts used to hedge foreign currency revenue.
Income Taxes
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
Our effective tax rates for the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 7% and 25%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates.
Our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due mainly to the adjustment of our previously estimated effective tax rate for the year to reflect the actual full year mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income. In addition, upon completion of our annual domestic and foreign tax returns, we adjusted the estimated tax provision to reflect the tax returns filed and recorded an income tax benefit which lowered our effective tax rate.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18% and 25%, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax rates. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, our U.S. income before income taxes was $8.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, and comprised 32% and 38%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the foreign income before income taxes was $19.2 billion and $15.4 billion, respectively, and comprised 68% and 62%, respectively, of our income before income taxes. In fiscal years 2011 and 2010, the reduction of the U.S. federal statutory rate as a result of foreign earnings taxed at lower rates was 16% and 12%, respectively.
In addition, our effective tax rate was lower than in the prior year due to a partial settlement with the I.R.S. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 relating to the audit of tax years 2004 to 2006. This partial settlement reduced our income tax expense for fiscal year 2011 by $461 million.
Unearned revenue at June 30, 2011 comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi-year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. Unearned revenue at June 30, 2011 also included payments for: post-delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; OEM minimum commitments; unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Windows Phone and Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2011:
 
Three months ended June 30, 2011 compared with three months ended June 30, 2010
Fourth quarter cash flows from operations increased $338 million over the prior year to $5.9 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers, offset in part by other changes in working capital. Cash used in financing decreased $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion due mainly to a $2.6 billion decrease in common stock repurchases, offset in part by reduced proceeds from issuances of common stock of $732 million. Cash used in investing decreased $3.2 billion to $1.0 billion due mainly to a $2.6 billion increase in cash from securities lending.
Twelve months ended June 30, 2011 compared with twelve months ended June 30, 2010
Cash flows from operations increased $2.9 billion during the current fiscal year to $27.0 billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $4.9 billion to $8.4 billion due mainly to a $5.8 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $602 million increase in cash paid for dividends. Cash used in investing increased $3.3 billion to $14.6 billion due to a $5.8 billion increase in purchases of investments, offset in part by a $2.5 billion increase in cash from securities lending.

Prior year results include recognition of $224 million of deferred revenue related to the Office 2010 technology guarantee program.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 19, 2012 
"We delivered solid financial results, even as we prepare for a launch year that will accelerate many of our key products and services," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "Coming out of the Consumer Electronics Show, we're seeing very positive reviews for our new phones and PCs, and a strong response to our new Metro style design that will unify consumer experiences across our phones, PCs, tablets, and television in 2012."
The Microsoft Business Division reported $6.28 billion in second quarter revenue, a 3% increase from the prior year period, and a 7% increase excluding the prior year recognition of deferred revenue for the Office 2010 technology guarantee program. Nearly 200 million licenses of Office 2010 have been sold in the 18 months since launch. Revenue from Exchange and SharePoint grew by 10% or more over the prior year period, and revenue from Lync and Dynamics CRM grew by more than 30%.
The Server & Tools business posted $4.77 billion in second quarter revenue, an 11% increase from the prior year period, reflecting double-digit revenue growth in Windows Server and SQL Server premium editions and more than 20% growth in System Center revenue.
"We saw strong demand for our business products and services, despite the soft PC market and continuing economic uncertainty in key parts of the world," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "We delivered record earnings per share by continuing to manage our costs while investing for future growth."
The Windows and Windows Live Division posted revenue of $4.74 billion, a 6% decline from the prior period. Microsoft has sold over 525 million Windows 7 licenses since launch.
The Online Services Division reported revenue of $784 million, a 10% increase from the prior year period. Bing organic US market share grew to 15.1% while Bing-powered US market share, including Yahoo! properties, was approximately 27%.
The Entertainment & Devices Division posted revenue of $4.24 billion, an increase of 15% from the prior period. The Xbox 360 installed base now totals approximately 66 million consoles and 18 million Kinect sensors. Xbox LIVE now has 40 million members worldwide, an increase of 33% from the prior year period.
"In addition to the continued strength of our commercial business, this holiday season was the strongest in Microsoft history, thanks to good sales execution and compelling products like Xbox 360 and Kinect," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "We are seeing a lot of excitement for new devices, from Windows 7 Ultrabooks to new Windows Phones, as well as growing anticipation for Windows 8."

(c) suggest a date for the special meeting, which date shall be no fewer than thirty (30) and no more than ninety (90) days from the date on which the request is delivered to the secretary of the Corporation; and
(d) contain the information required of a Noticing Shareholder by Section 1.13(b) of these Bylaws.
If the Board of Directors determines a shareholder request for a special meeting complies with the Articles of Incorporation and the provisions of these Bylaws, the Board shall call and send notice of a special meeting for the purpose set forth in such request within 30 days of receipt of the request. The Board of Directors shall determine the date for such special meeting and the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.
Given the expense and resource commitment of holding a special meeting, in making the decision to call a special meeting per shareholder request, the Board shall have discretion as to the call and purposes of a meeting, where demands are repetitious or overlapping, and may refuse to call a meeting for a purpose identical or similar to a purpose for which a previous special meeting was held in the previous 120 days. Similarly, the Board may decline to call a special meeting when, in the good faith judgment of the Board, the purpose of the proposed meeting does not present a time sensitive issue that must be addressed before the next scheduled annual meeting.
. No business may be transacted at an annual or special meeting of shareholders other than business that is
1.3 Business at Annual and Special Meetings
(a) specified in a notice of meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof,
(b) otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof,
(c) specified in a notice of meeting stated in a shareholder special meeting request pursuant to Section 1.2 of these Bylaws, or
(d) otherwise brought before an annual meeting:
(i) by (1) a shareholder that holds of record stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting on such business (including any election of a director) (a "Record Holder") or (2) a person (a "Nominee Holder") that holds such stock through a nominee or "street name" holder of record of such stock and can demonstrate to the Corporation such indirect ownership of such stock and such Nominee Holder's entitlement to vote such stock on such business, and
(ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in Section 1.13 (Record Holders and Nominee Holders are referred to as "Noticing Shareholders").
Clauses (c) and (d) of this Section 1.3 shall be the exclusive means for a Noticing Shareholder to make director nominations or submit other business before a meeting of shareholders (other than proposals brought under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and included in the Corporation's notice of meeting, which proposals are not governed by these Bylaws).
. Meetings of shareholders shall be held at such place within or outside the State of Washington as determined by the Board of Directors, or an authorized committee of the Board, pursuant to proper notice.
1.4 Place of Meetings
. Written or electronic notice of each shareholders' meeting stating the date, time, and place and, for a special meeting, the purpose(s) for which the meeting is called, shall be given by the Corporation not less than ten (10) (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record, to the shareholder's address as it appears on the current record of shareholders of the Corporation.
1.5 Notice
. At any meeting of the shareholders, a majority in interest of all the shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented by shareholders of record in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.
1.6 Quorum of Shareholders
Once a share is represented at a meeting, other than to object to holding the meeting or transacting business, it is deemed to be present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment to a new date, time, or place unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.
If a quorum exists, action on a matter is approved by a voting group if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the Washington Business Corporation Act, as amended ("WBCA"), or of the Articles of Incorporation or of these Bylaws a different vote is required.
. A majority of the shares represented at the meeting, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn the meeting from time to time. At a reconvened meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted at the meeting as may have been brought at the adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 1.3. If a meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if a new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment; however, if the WBCA requires that a new record date for the adjourned meeting must be fixed, then notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.
1.7 Adjournment
. For the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the Board of Directors may fix in advance a record date for any such determination of shareholders, which date shall not be more than seventy (70) days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken.
1.8 Record Date and Transfer Books
If no record date is fixed for such purposes, the date on which notice of the meeting is given or the date on which the resolution of the Board of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determination of shareholders.
 
Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 2
When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, unless the Board of Directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date is fixed for the original meeting.
. The officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the Corporation shall make at least ten (10) days before each meeting of shareholders a complete record of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged by any applicable voting groups and in alphabetical order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each shareholder. The record of shareholders shall be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any shareholder or any shareholder's agent during the whole time of the meeting.
1.9 Voting Record
. Shareholders of record may vote at any meeting either in person or by proxy. A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote for the shareholder by submitting (a) an appointment form signed by the shareholder or the shareholder's attorney-in-fact, or (b) an electronic transmission sent in accordance with the provisions for electronic notice under Section 3.3. An appointment of proxy is effective when an appointment form or an electronic transmission (or documentary evidence thereof, including verification information) is received by the person authorized to tabulate votes for the Corporation. The proxy has the same power to vote as that possessed by the shareholder, unless the appointment form or electronic transmission contains an express limitation on the power to vote or direction as to how to vote the shares on a particular matter, in which event the Corporation must tabulate the votes in a manner consistent with that limitation or direction. An appointment of proxy is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment form or electronic transmission.
1.10 Proxies
. The officer designated by the Chief Executive Officer (or in the absence of a designation by the Chief Executive Officer, any other officer designated by the Board of Directors) may call any meeting of shareholders to order and shall be the Chairman of the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present at any meeting of its shareholders, shall act as the Secretary of the meeting. If the Secretary is absent from any meeting of shareholders, the Chairman of the meeting may appoint a Secretary for the meeting.
1.11 Organization of Meeting
. The Chairman of a meeting of shareholders, determined in accordance with Section 1.11, shall have discretion to establish the order of business for the meeting subject to any specific order established by the Board of Directors.
1.12 Order of Business
. In order for a Noticing Shareholder to properly bring any item of business before an annual meeting of shareholders, the Noticing Shareholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation in compliance with the requirements of this Section 1.13. This Section 1.13 shall constitute an "advance notice provision" for annual meetings for purposes of Rule 14a-4(c)(1) under the Exchange Act.
1.13 Notice of Shareholder Business to be Conducted at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders
(a) To be timely, a Noticing Shareholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation: not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder's notice as described above.
(b) To be in proper form, whether in regard to a nominee for election to the Board of Directors or other business, a Noticing Shareholder's notice to the Secretary must:

(F) any rights to dividends on the shares of the Corporation owned beneficially by the Holder that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the Corporation,

Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 4
Such information shall be provided as of the date of the notice and shall be supplemented by the Holder not later than 10 days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date.
(ii) If the notice relates to any business other than a nomination of a director or directors that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, the notice must set forth:

(v) With respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, the Noticing Shareholder shall include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation, and agreement required by Section 1.14. The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of the nominee.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 1.13(a) to the contrary, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a shareholder's notice required by these Bylaws shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which the public announcement naming all nominees or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors is first made by the Corporation.
 
Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 5
(d) For purposes of these Bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by a national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(e) Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws shall be eligible to serve as directors. Only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in compliance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these Bylaws, to declare that such proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these Bylaws, a Noticing Shareholder also shall comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in these Bylaws; provided, however, that any references in these Bylaws to the Exchange Act or the rules thereunder are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to nominations or proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to Section 1.3 or Section 1.13.
(g) Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Notice of shareholder proposals that are, or that the Noticing Shareholder intends to be, governed by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act are not governed by these Bylaws.
. To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as a director of the Corporation by a Holder, a person must complete and deliver (in accordance with the time periods prescribed for delivery of notice under Section 1.13) to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation a written questionnaire providing the information requested about the background and qualifications of such person and the background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made and a written representation and agreement (the questionnaire, representation, and agreement to be in the form provided by the Secretary upon written request) that such person:
1.14 Submission of Questionnaire, Representation and Agreement
(a) is not and will not become a party to:
(i) any agreement, arrangement or understanding with, and has not given any commitment or assurance to, any person or entity as to how the person, if elected as a director of the Corporation, will act or vote on any issue or question (a "Voting Commitment") that has not been disclosed to the Corporation, or
(ii) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the person's ability to comply, if elected as a director of the Corporation, with the person's fiduciary duties under applicable law,
(b) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Corporation with respect to any direct or indirect compensation, reimbursement, or indemnification in connection with service or action as a director that has not been disclosed therein, and
(c) in the person's individual capacity and on behalf of any person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made, would be in compliance, if elected as a director of the Corporation, and will comply with all applicable publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality, and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines of the Corporation.
 
Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 6
. The shareholders may amend or repeal these Bylaws, or adopt new bylaws, even though the Bylaws also may be amended or repealed, or new bylaws also may be adopted, by the Board of Directors, by action taken in the manner provided by the WBCA and the Articles of Incorporation.
1.15 Bylaw Amendments
. The business affairs and property of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of not less than three directors nor more than eleven directors. The number of directors may at any time be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the shareholders at the annual meeting. Directors need not be shareholders of the Corporation or residents of the State of Washington.
2.1 Number and Qualifications
. At each annual shareholders' meeting the shareholders shall elect the directors to hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. If, for any reason, the directors shall not have been elected at any annual meeting, they may be elected at a special meeting of shareholders called for that purpose in the manner provided by these Bylaws.
2.2 Election  Term of Office
Except as provided in Section 2.10 and in this paragraph, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director. The following shall not be votes cast: (a) a share whose ballot is marked as withheld; (b) a share otherwise present at the meeting but for which there is an abstention; and (c) a share otherwise present at the meeting as to which a shareholder gives no authority or direction. In a contested election, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast.
A contested election is one in which (a) on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 1.13(a), a Noticing Shareholder has complied with the requirements of Section 1.13 with respect to one or more nominees; and (b) prior to the date that notice of the meeting is given, the board of directors has not made a determination that none of the candidacies of the Noticing Shareholder's nominees creates a bona fide election contest. For purposes of these Bylaws, it is assumed that on the last day for delivery of a notice under Section 1.13(a), there is a candidate nominated by the board of directors for each of the director positions to be voted on at the meeting. The following procedures apply in a non-contested election. A nominee who does not receive a majority vote shall not be elected. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, an incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority vote shall continue to serve as a holdover director until the earliest of (a) 90 days after the date on which an inspector determines the voting results as to that director pursuant to RCW 23B.07.290; (b) the date on which the Board of Directors appoints an individual to fill the office held by such director, which appointment shall constitute the filling of a vacancy by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 2.10; or (c) the date of the director's resignation. Any vacancy resulting from the non-election of a director under this Section 2.2 may be filled by the Board of Directors as provided in Section 2.10. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider promptly whether to fill the office of a nominee failing to receive a majority vote and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors about filling the office. The Board of Directors will act on the Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation and within ninety (90) days after the certification of the shareholder vote will disclose publicly its decision. Except as provided in the next sentence, no director who failed to receive a majority vote for election will participate in the Governance and Nominating Committee recommendation or Board of Directors decision about filling his or her office. If no director receives a majority vote in an uncontested election, then the incumbent directors (a) will nominate a slate of directors and hold a special meeting for the purpose of electing those nominees as soon as practicable, and (b) may in the interim fill one or more offices with the same director(s) who will continue in office until their successors are elected.
. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such places, and at such times as the Board may determine, and, if so determined, no notice thereof need be given. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors may be held without notice immediately after the annual meeting of shareholders at the same place at which such meeting was held.
2.3 Regular Meetings
. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be held at any time or place upon the call of a majority of directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Operating Officer.
2.4 Special Meetings
 
Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 7
. No notice is required for regular meetings of the Board of Directors. Notice of special meetings of the Board of Directors, stating the date, time, and place thereof, shall be given in a manner described in Section 3.3 at least two (2) days prior to the date of the meeting. The purpose of the meeting need not be given in the notice.
2.5 Notice
. A director may waive notice of a special meeting of the Board of Directors either before or after the meeting, and the waiver shall be deemed to be the equivalent of giving notice. The waiver must be given in accordance with the requirements for written or electronic notice in Section 3.3. Attendance or participation of a director at a meeting shall constitute waiver of notice of that meeting unless the director attends or participates for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of business because the meeting has not been lawfully called or convened.
2.6 Waiver of Notice
. A majority of the members of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, but if at any meeting of the Board there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum shall have been obtained. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the members present shall decide any question brought before such meeting, except as otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation or by these Bylaws.
2.7 Quorum of Directors
. A majority of the directors present, even if less than a quorum, may adjourn a meeting and continue it to a later time. Notice of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat, other than by announcement, shall not be necessary. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which could have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
2.8 Adjournment
. Any director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, or the Secretary of the Corporation. Any director resignation is effective when the notice is delivered, unless the notice specifies a later effective date.
2.9 Resignation
. Unless otherwise provided by the WBCA, in case of any vacancy in the Board of Directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors or non-election of a director pursuant to Section 2.2, the remaining directors, whether constituting a quorum or not, may fill the vacancy.
2.10 Vacancies
. The Board of Directors shall have the sole authority to fix the amount of compensation of directors.
2.11 Compensation
. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board, may designate from among its members one or more committees, each of which:
2.12 Committees
(a) Shall have two (2) or more members;
(b) Shall be governed by the same rules regarding meetings, action without meetings, notice, and waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements as are applied to the Board; and
(c) To the extent provided in the resolution, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the Board, except no such committee shall have the authority to:
(i) Authorize or approve a distribution except according to a general formula or method prescribed by the Board;
(ii) Approve or propose to shareholders action which the WBCA requires to be approved by shareholders;
(iii) Fill vacancies on the Board or on any of its committees;
(iv) Amend the Articles of Incorporation;
 
Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 8
(v) Adopt, amend, or repeal these Bylaws;
(vi) Approve a plan of merger not requiring shareholder approval; or
(vii) Authorize or approve the issuance or sale or contract for sale of shares, or determine the designation and relative rights, preferences, and limitations on a class or series of shares, except that the Board may authorize a committee, or a senior executive officer of the Corporation, to do so within limits specifically prescribed by the Board.
. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board may be accomplished without a meeting if the action is taken by all the members of the Board or all the members of the committee, as the case may be. The action must be evidenced by one or more consents describing the action to be taken, given by all directors or all members of the committee, as the case may be, to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes in a manner equivalent to written or electronic notice under Section 3.3. Directors' consents may be given either before or after the action taken.
3.1 Action by Unanimous Consent
Action taken by unanimous consent is effective when the last director consents to the action, unless the consent specifies a later effective date.
. Meetings of the shareholders, the Board of Directors, and committees of the Board may be effectuated by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
3.2 Use of Communications Equipment
. Terms used in this Bylaw shall be as defined in the WBCA.
3.3 Oral, Written and Electronic Notice
Oral notice may be communicated in person or by telephone, wire, or wireless equipment that does not transmit a facsimile of the notice. Oral notice is effective when communicated if communicated in a comprehensible manner.
Written notice may be transmitted by mail, private carrier, or personal delivery; or telephone, wire, or wireless equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice and provides the transmitter with an electronically generated receipt. Written notice is effective at the earliest of the following: (a) when received; (b) five (5) days after its deposit in the U.S. mail if mailed with first-class postage to the address as it appears on the current records of the Corporation; (c) on the date shown on the return receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and the receipt is signed by or on behalf of the addressee. Written notice to a shareholder is effective (a) when mailed, if mailed with first class postage prepaid; and (b) when dispatched, if prepaid, by air courier.
Notices to directors and shareholders from the Corporation and from directors and shareholders to the Corporation may be provided in an electronic transmission which contains or is accompanied by information from which it can be reasonably verified that the transmission was authorized by the director, the shareholder, or by the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. Subject to contrary provisions in the WBCA, notice to shareholders or directors in an electronic transmission shall be effective only with respect to shareholders and directors that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and that have designated in the consent the address, location, or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted and with respect to a notice that otherwise complies with any other requirements of the WBCA and any applicable federal law. A shareholder or director who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the Corporation in the form of a record. The consent of any shareholder or director is revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with the consent, and (b) this inability becomes known to the Secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the Corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
 
Bylaws of Microsoft Corporation  Page 9
. The officers of the Corporation may consist of a Chairman, a Chief Executive Officer, one or more Presidents, one or more Vice Presidents (who may be designated as Corporate Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, Executive Vice Presidents or Group Vice Presidents), a Secretary, and a Treasurer as appointed by the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer. The Corporation may have such additional or assistant officers (sometimes referred to as "additional officers") as the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, or Chief Operating Officer may deem necessary for its business and may appoint from time to time. The Board of Directors shall also have the authority, but shall not be required, to designate officers as the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or similar such titles. Any two or more offices may be held by the same person.
4.1 Positions
If a director/officer has not been designated as Chairman, or if the designated Chairman is not present at a meeting, the Board of Directors shall elect a Chairman from amongst its members to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors for such meeting. The Chairman shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors, and shall have such other powers as the Board may determine.
. The officers of the Corporation shall be appointed annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of the Board held after each annual meeting of the shareholders. If officers are not appointed at such meeting, such appointment shall occur as soon as possible thereafter, or may be left vacant. Each officer shall hold office until a successor shall have been appointed and qualified or until said officer's earlier death, resignation, or removal.
4.2 Appointment and Term of Office
. The Chief Executive Officer shall have general charge and supervision of the business of the Corporation, shall see that all orders, actions and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried out, and shall have such other authority and shall perform such other duties as set forth in these Bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the Bylaws, such other authorities and duties as prescribed by the Board.
4.3 Authority and Duties of the Chief Executive Officer

On June 28, 2012, Microsoft Corporation (the "Company") concluded it will take a noncash, non-tax-deductible charge of approximately $6.2 billion for impairment of goodwill in its Online Services Division segment in the quarter ending June 30, 2012. The conclusion was made in connection with the Company's annual impairment testing of goodwill for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. While the Online Services Division business has been improving, the Company's expectations for future growth and profitability are lower than previous estimates. The Company's press release announcing the impairment charge is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Corp. today announced that it will take a non-cash, non-tax deductible income statement charge for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 for the impairment of goodwill in its Online Services Division segment, mostly related to its 2007 aQuantive acquisition.
REDMOND, Wash.  July
2
, 20
12
Under accounting guidelines, companies are required to conduct an annual goodwill impairment test for each business unit. Goodwill arises in an acquisition when the fair value paid for a business exceeds the value of the identifiable net assets. The goodwill in the Online Services Division was substantially the result of the 2007 acquisition of aQuantive. As a result of its 2012 impairment review, Microsoft has determined that a write down of its Online Services Division goodwill of approximately $6.2 billion is required.
Bing search share in the US has been increasing, revenue per search (RPS) has been growing, MSN is the number one portal in 29 markets worldwide and the company's partnership with Yahoo! has continued to expand geographically. While the Online Services Division business has been improving, the company's expectations for future growth and profitability are lower than previous estimates.
Microsoft completed its acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. on August 13, 2007, in an all-cash transaction valued at just over $6.3 billion. While the aQuantive acquisition continues to provide tools for Microsoft's online advertising efforts, the acquisition did not accelerate growth to the degree anticipated contributing to the write down.
Microsoft does not expect this accounting write-down to affect its ongoing business or financial performance.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Reports Record Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year Revenue
Enterprise demand fuels continued Microsoft growth with significant product launches ahead.
Microsoft Corp. today announced quarterly revenue of $18.06 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2012. Operating income and loss per share for the quarter were $192 million and $0.06 per share.
REDMOND, Wash.  July 19, 2012 
The financial results reflect the previously announced non-cash, non-tax-deductible income statement charge of $6.19 billion for the impairment of goodwill and the deferral of $540 million of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer. Adjusting for these items, non-GAAP fourth quarter revenue, operating income, and earnings per share were $18.60 billion, $6.93 billion, and $0.73 per share, which represented increases of 7%, 12%, and 6%, respectively, over the prior year period.
 
 
"We delivered record fourth quarter and annual revenue, and we're fast approaching the most exciting launch season in Microsoft history," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer of Microsoft. "Over the coming year, we'll release the next versions of Windows, Office, Windows Server, Windows Phone, and many other products and services that will drive our business forward and provide unprecedented opportunity to our customers and partners."
"The combination of solid revenue growth and rigorous cost discipline drove double-digit operating income growth for the quarter, adjusting for the goodwill impairment and deferred revenue," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer of Microsoft. "We are focusing our resources in strategic areas that will deliver shareholder value and long-term growth opportunities."
For Microsoft's fiscal year 2012, the company's revenue, operating income, and earnings per share were $73.72 billion, $21.76 billion, and $2.00 per share. Adjusting for the goodwill impairment charge and deferred revenue, non-GAAP fiscal year 2012 revenue, operating income, and earnings per share were $74.26 billion, $28.50 billion, and $2.78 per share, which represented increases of 6%, 5%, and 5%, respectively, over adjusted non-GAAP fiscal year 2011 figures.
 
 
The Server & Tools business revenue grew 13% for the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year. Enterprises are purchasing SQL Server and System Center to support their mission critical workloads and build their business intelligence and private cloud infrastructure. Windows Server 2012 will be available this September.
The Microsoft Business Division revenue grew 7% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the full year reflecting continued momentum in Office 2010 sales. Office is now installed on more than 1 billion PCs around the world. Earlier this week, we announced the customer preview of the new Microsoft Office.
The Windows & Windows Live Division revenue declined 13% for the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer, Windows Division non-GAAP revenue declined 1% for the fourth quarter and 1% for the full year. Windows 7 adoption continued with more than 50% of worldwide enterprise desktops now running Windows 7. The next version of Windows will release to manufacturing this August and will become generally available October 26, 2012.
The Online Services Division revenue grew 8% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the full year reflecting growth in our search business. Bing organic U.S. search market share was 15.6% for the month of June 2012, up 120 points from the prior year period.
The Entertainment and Devices Division revenue grew 20% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year primarily reflecting the addition of Skype. Xbox has now been the top-selling console in the U.S. for 18 consecutive months. During the year, Xbox launched new television and video partnerships for Xbox LIVE, and announced Xbox SmartGlass, which connects phones, PCs, and tablets with the Xbox 360 console to enable more interactive and engaging entertainment.
"Delivering a record year takes great products, solutions, services, and tremendous execution by our people," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer of Microsoft. "Our enterprise business is firing on all cylinders and we couldn't be more excited about the wave of innovation and new releases that position us well for the coming years."
Business Outlook
Microsoft reaffirms fiscal year 2013 operating expense guidance of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion.

Adjusted Financial Results and Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we have provided certain non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company's performance. For fourth quarter fiscal year 2012 revenue, operating income, and earnings per share growth, we included the impact of revenue deferred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 relating to the Windows Upgrade Offer and excluded the impact of the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. For full year fiscal year 2012 revenue, operating income, and earnings per share growth, we included the impact of revenue deferred during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2012 relating to the Windows Upgrade Offer, excluded the impact of the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, and excluded the impact of the tax settlement benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. Presenting these measures without the impact of these items gives additional insight into operational performance and helps clarify trends affecting the company's business. For comparability of reporting, management considers this information in conjunction with GAAP amounts in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

SUMMARY
Revenue this quarter was $18.1 billion, up 4% year over year, driven primarily by business demand for Microsoft's desktop and infrastructure offerings. We saw strength in our Server and Tools business with revenue growth of 13% and in our Microsoft Business Division with revenue growth of 7%. Revenue in our Entertainment and Devices Division grew 20%, primarily reflecting the inclusion of Skype. Windows & Windows Live Division revenue declined 13% primarily due to the deferral of $540 million related to the Windows Upgrade Offer.
Enterprise demand for our products and services drove strong multi-year commitments resulting in multi-year licensing revenue growth of 14% and a record unearned revenue balance of $20.1 billion, up 17% over the prior year. As businesses invest in the Microsoft platform and our roadmap, they are doing so by attaching additional seats and additional products and services to their multi-year enterprise agreements.
Cost of revenue grew 12%, primarily reflecting payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, the inclusion of Skype, and higher headcount-related expenses.
Operating expenses increased primarily due to a $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our OSD business. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge and changes in cost of revenue, other operating expenses were flat reflecting our ongoing cost management.
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 was 237% as compared to 7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. Our effective tax rate increased over the prior year due mainly to the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge in the current year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 was low due mainly to the reduction of our previously estimated effective tax rate for the year to reflect the actual full year mix of foreign and U.S. taxable income.
Operating income was $192 million for the quarter, and loss per share was $0.06.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
Windows & Windows Live Division
Windows Division revenue decreased $598 million or 13%, primarily reflecting the deferral of $540 million related to the Windows Upgrade Offer announced in the quarter. The offer provides consumers who buy qualifying Windows 7 PCs the option to purchase a downloadable upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for an estimated retail price of $14.99 during the promotion period. Qualifying purchases must be made between June 2, 2012 and January 31, 2013, and offers must be redeemed by February 28, 2013. The deferral impacted only the timing of revenue recognition and not cash flows from operations during the periods reported.
 
During the quarter, we launched the release preview of Windows 8. We have announced that Windows 8 will become generally available in October 2012.
Windows Division operating income decreased $511 million or 18% as a result of decreased revenue due to the revenue deferral and higher research and development expenses, offset in part by lower sales and marketing expenses.
Server and Tools
Server and Tools revenue increased $568 million or 13% this quarter, primarily driven by 22% growth in multi-year licensing revenue as customers continued to invest in Microsoft's private, public, and hybrid cloud solutions.
 
 
During the quarter, we launched SQL Server 2012 and System Center 2012. We also released an update to Windows Azure, which gives customers a choice of platform and infrastructure services and is designed to make it easier to build, migrate, and manage applications in the cloud.
Server and Tools operating income increased $409 million or 24%, primarily reflecting revenue growth, offset in part by higher headcount-related expenses associated with Enterprise Services.
Online Services Division
OSD revenue increased $55 million or 8% this quarter reflecting continued growth in search advertising revenue, offset in part by decreased display advertising revenue.
 
 
OSD operating loss increased $5.9 billion primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 billion, which we recorded as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. The non-cash, non-tax-deductible charge related mainly to goodwill acquired through our 2007 acquisition of aQuantive, Inc. While our search business has been improving, our expectations for future growth and profitability for OSD are lower than our previous estimates. We do not expect the impairment charge to affect OSD's ongoing business or financial performance.
Excluding the $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge, OSD operating loss decreased $266 million or 36%, due to higher revenue and lower cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses.
Microsoft Business Division
MBD revenue increased $418 million or 7% this quarter reflecting continued momentum in sales of the 2010 Microsoft Office system.
 
 
MBD operating income increased $339 million or 9%, primarily due to revenue growth, offset in part by higher research and development costs and higher cost of revenue.
On June 25, 2012, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Yammer, Inc., for $1.2 billion. The agreement, which closed on July 18, 2012, will bring enterprise social networking features to our existing communication and collaboration products.
Entertainment and Devices Division
EDD revenue increased $292 million or 20%, primarily reflecting the addition of Skype. Within the Xbox platform:
 
 
In June 2012, we announced that the next version of our Windows Phone operating system will be based on the same core as the Windows PC operating system. This will enable a wave of new mobile scenarios for consumers, developers, and IT professionals.
EDD operating income decreased $276 million, primarily reflecting higher operating expenses, offset in part by revenue growth. Cost of revenue increased primarily due to payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives and the addition of Skype. Research and development expenses increased primarily reflecting higher headcount-related expenses, including Skype.
Corporate-Level Activity
Corporate-level expenses decreased due mainly to lower legal costs and headcount-related expenses.
OPERATING EXPENSES
Cost of revenue increased $455 million or 12% primarily reflecting payments made to Nokia related to joint strategic initiatives, the inclusion of Skype, and higher headcount-related expenses primarily related to Enterprise Services.
Research and development expenses increased $201 million or 8%, primarily reflecting increased headcount-related expenses.
Sales and marketing expenses decreased $135 million or 3%, primarily reflecting decreased product advertising and decreased headcount-related expenses.
General and administrative expenses decreased $43 million or 4%, primarily due to lower legal costs, offset in part by increased headcount-related expenses.
OTHER INCOME
The components of other income were as follows:
 
 
Other income increased primarily reflecting increased net recognized gains on investments. Net recognized gains on investments increased primarily due to a gain recognized on the partial sale of our Facebook holding upon the initial public offering on May 18, 2012, offset in part by lower gains on sales of equity and fixed-income securities and higher other-than-temporary impairments.
UNEARNED REVENUE
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2012:
 
Unearned revenue by segment was as follows:
 
Windows & Windows Live Division unearned revenue at June 30, 2012 includes $540 million related to the Windows Upgrade Offer.

"I'm thrilled to have served on the board at such a pivotal time for Microsoft, including the development of Windows 8, Windows RT and Microsoft Surface, which will bring exciting new opportunities for customers and the industry as a whole," said Hastings, 51, who joined the Microsoft board in March 2007. "I've decided to reduce the number of boards I serve on, so that I can focus on Netflix and on my education work."
Hastings currently serves on the boards of Netflix, Facebook, Microsoft, Dreambox Learning, the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP), and the California Charter Schools Association (CCSA).
The Microsoft board has traditionally ranged between nine and 11 members. The board added two new members with extensive tech industry experience earlier this year, with
John W. Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and former chairman and CEO of Symantec Corp., joining in February, and Stephen J. Luczo, chairman, president and CEO of Seagate Technology PLC, joining in May.
With Hasting's decision, nine directors have been nominated for re-election to the Microsoft board: Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman; Steve Ballmer, CEO, Microsoft; Dina Dublon, former chief financial officer, JPMorgan Chase; Maria M. Klawe, president, Harvey Mudd College; Stephen J. Luczo, chairman, president and CEO, Seagate Technology; David F. Marquardt, general partner, August Capital; Charles H. Noski, former vice chairman, Bank of America Corp.; Dr. Helmut Panke, former chairman of the board of management, BMW AG; and John W. Thompson, CEO, Virtual Instruments.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 18, 2012, Microsoft Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section, and shall not be incorporated by reference into any registration statement or other document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits:
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Reports First-Quarter Results
Upcoming launches of key products and services position Microsoft for long-term profit growth.
Microsoft Corp. today announced quarterly revenue of $16.01 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2012. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $5.31 billion, $4.47 billion, and $0.53 per share.
REDMOND, Wash.  Oct. 18, 2012 
These financial results reflect the deferral of $1.36 billion of revenue and $0.13 of diluted earnings per share, due to the Windows Upgrade Offer, pre-sales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability, and the Office Offer.
 
Totals may not foot due to rounding
"The launch of Windows 8 is the beginning of a new era at Microsoft," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "Investments we've made over a number of years are now coming together to create a future of exceptional devices and services, with tremendous opportunity for our customers, developers, and partners."
The Server & Tools business reported $4.55 billion in first-quarter revenue, an 8% increase from the prior year period, driven by double-digit revenue growth in SQL Server and more than 20% growth in System Center revenue. In September, Microsoft continued to enrich its server offerings with the launch of Windows Server 2012.
The Microsoft Business Division posted $5.50 billion in first-quarter revenue, a 2% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusting for the impact of the Office Offer, Microsoft Business Division non-GAAP revenue increased 1% for the first quarter. Microsoft's productivity server offerings  including Lync, SharePoint, and Exchange  continued double-digit revenue growth.
"While enterprise revenue continued to grow and we managed our expenses, the slowdown in PC demand ahead of the Windows 8 launch resulted in a decline in operating income," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Multi-year licensing revenue grew double-digits across Windows, Server & Tools, and Microsoft Business Division products as businesses commit to our technology roadmap."
The Windows & Windows Live Division posted revenue of $3.24 billion, a 33% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusting for the impact of the Windows Upgrade Offer and pre-sales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability, Windows division non-GAAP revenue declined 9% for the first quarter. Windows 8 will become generally available October 26, 2012.
"We're incredibly excited to be approaching general availability of Windows 8 and Windows RT," said Kevin Turner, Microsoft chief operating officer. "We've already certified more than 1,000 systems for Windows 8 from our hardware partners, ranging from the smallest tablets and convertibles to touch-enabled ultrabooks and all-in-ones to the most powerful desktop computers."
The Online Services Division reported revenue of $697 million, a 9% increase from the prior year period. Online advertising revenue grew 15% driven primarily by an increase in revenue per search.
The Entertainment and Devices Division posted revenue of $1.95 billion, a decrease of 1% from the prior year period. Xbox continues to be the top-selling console in the U.S., where it now has 49% market share. Windows Phone 8 will launch this fall with an expanded array of products, prices, carriers, and markets. Skype continued its rapid growth and now has over 280 million users.
Business Outlook
Microsoft reaffirms fiscal year 2013 operating expense guidance of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion.
Webcast Details
Peter Klein, chief financial officer, Frank Brod, chief accounting officer, and Bill Koefoed, general manager of Investor Relations, will host a conference call and webcast at 2:30 p.m. PDT (5:30 p.m. EDT) today to discuss details of the company's performance for the quarter and certain forward-looking information. The session may be accessed at . The webcast will be available for replay through the close of business on Oct. 18, 2013.

Adjusted Financial Results and Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we have provided certain non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company's performance. For first quarter fiscal year 2013 revenue, operating income, and earnings per share growth, we included the impact of revenue deferred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 relating to the Windows Upgrade Offer, pre-sales of Windows 8 to OEMs prior to general availability, and the Office Offer. Presenting these measures without the impact of these items gives additional insight into operational performance and helps clarify trends affecting the company's business. For comparability of reporting, management considers this information in conjunction with GAAP amounts in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 8.01. Other Events
Microsoft Corporation is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K to reflect the retrospective adoption of an amendment to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 220, "Comprehensive Income" ("ASC 220"), with respect to the financial information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012.
As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, we adopted the amendment to ASC 220, which addressed the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements. The new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Instead, an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements and does not change existing recognition and measurement requirements in our consolidated financial statements.
Following is a presentation of comprehensive income for each annual period in the three years ended June 30, 2012:
 
The information included in this Current Report on Form 8-K is presented for information purposes only in connection with the reporting change described above and does not amend or restate our audited consolidated financial statements, which were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012. This Current Report on Form 8-K does not reflect events occurring after we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and does not modify or update the disclosures therein in any way, other than to illustrate the adoption of the new accounting standard as described above.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

8. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act) relating to the offering of the Securities, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
such issuer free writing prospectus, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of, or omission or alleged omission to state, a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 8(c), the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to not more than one separate local counsel in any jurisdiction in which the indemnified party requires representation by separate counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the
provided
however
 
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
 
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Defaulting Underwriters
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
(c) If after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but if for any other reason any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (ii) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is, and has been, acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company directly or indirectly, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed, or will assume, an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any similar obligation to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
Nature of Underwriters' Obligations
 
13. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by any Representative and may assume that such statement, request, notice or agreement has been duly authorized by such Underwriter.
Authority of Representatives
14. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the addresses set forth on hereto; and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399, Attention: Corporate Vice President and Treasurer; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth on hereto, shall be provided to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

Exhibit 99.1
Microsoft Reports Record Revenue of $21.5 Billion in Second Quarter
Strong business demand and key product launches drive record revenue.
Microsoft Corp. today announced quarterly revenue of $21.46 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2012. Operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $7.77 billion, $6.38 billion, and $0.76 per share.
REDMOND, Wash.  Jan. 24, 2013 
These financial results reflect the net deferral of revenue for the Windows Upgrade Offer, Office Upgrade Offer and Pre-sales, and the Entertainment and Devices Division Video Game Deferral, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred revenue for Windows 8 Pre-sales. The following table reconciles these financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to non-GAAP financial results. We have provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company's performance.
 
"Our big, bold ambition to reimagine Windows as well as launch Surface and Windows Phone 8 has sparked growing enthusiasm with our customers and unprecedented opportunity and creativity with our partners and developers," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "With new Windows devices, including Surface Pro, and the new Office on the horizon, we'll continue to drive excitement for the Windows ecosystem and deliver our software through devices and services people love and businesses need."
The Windows Division posted revenue of $5.88 billion, a 24% increase from the prior year period. Adjusting for the net deferral of revenue for the Windows Upgrade Offer and the recognition of the previously deferred revenue from Windows 8 Pre-sales, Windows Division non-GAAP revenue increased 11% for the second quarter. Microsoft has sold over 60 million Windows 8 licenses to date.
"We saw strong growth in our enterprise business driven by multi-year commitments to the Microsoft platform, which positions us well for long-term growth," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Multi-year licensing revenue grew double-digits across Windows, Server & Tools, and the Microsoft Business Division."
The Server & Tools business reported $5.19 billion of revenue, a 9% increase from the prior year period, driven by double-digit percentage revenue growth in SQL Server and System Center.
"We see strong momentum in our enterprise business. With the launch of SQL Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012, we continue to see healthy growth in our data platform and infrastructure businesses and win share from our competitors," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "With the coming launch of the new Office, we will provide a cloud-enabled suite of products that will deliver unparalleled productivity and flexibility."
The Microsoft Business Division posted $5.69 billion of revenue, a 10% decrease from the prior year period. Adjusting for the impact of the Office Upgrade Offer and Pre-sales, Microsoft Business Division non-GAAP revenue increased 3% for the second quarter. Revenue from Microsoft's productivity server offerings  collectively including Lync, SharePoint, and Exchange  continued double-digit percentage growth.
The Online Services Division reported revenue of $869 million, an 11% increase from the prior year period. Online advertising revenue grew 15% driven by an increase in revenue per search.
The Entertainment and Devices Division posted revenue of $3.77 billion, a decrease of 11% from the prior year period. Adjusting for the Video Game Deferral, the division's non-GAAP revenue decreased 2% for the second quarter. Xbox continues to be the top-selling console in the United States. During the quarter, Microsoft launched Windows Phone 8 with a broad array of carriers and devices.
Business Outlook
Microsoft reaffirms fiscal year 2013 operating expense guidance of $30.3 billion to $30.9 billion.
Webcast Details
Peter Klein, chief financial officer, Frank Brod, chief accounting officer, and Chris Suh, general manager of Investor Relations, will host a conference call and webcast at 2:30 p.m. PST (5:30 p.m. EST) today to discuss details of the company's performance for the quarter and certain forward-looking information. The session may be accessed at http://www.microsoft.com/investor. The webcast will be available for replay through the close of business on Jan. 24, 2014.
Adjusted Financial Results and Non-GAAP Measures
For second quarter fiscal year 2013 GAAP revenue, operating income, and earnings per share growth included the net deferral of revenue for the Windows Upgrade Offer, the Office Upgrade Offer and Pre-sales, and the Entertainment and Devices Division Video Game Deferral, and the recognition of previously deferred revenue for Windows 8 Pre-sales. These items are defined in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2012. In addition to these financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we have provided certain non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company's performance. Presenting these measures without the impact of these items gives additional insight into operational performance and helps clarify trends affecting the company's business. For comparability of reporting, management considers this information in conjunction with GAAP amounts in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Microsoft Reports Third-Quarter Results

REDMOND, Wash.  Apr. 18, 2013 
These financial results reflect the net recognition of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, Office Upgrade Offer and Pre-Sales, and the Entertainment and Devices Division Video Game Deferral, partially offset by the European Commission fine. The following table reconciles these financial results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to non-GAAP financial results. We have provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the company's performance.
 
"The bold bets we made on cloud services are paying off as people increasingly choose Microsoft services including Office 365, Windows Azure, Xbox LIVE, and Skype," said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. "While there is still work to do, we are optimistic that the bets we've made on Windows devices position us well for the long-term."
The Microsoft Business Division posted $6.32 billion of revenue, an 8% increase from the prior year period. Adjusting for the net recognition of revenue related to the Office Upgrade Offer and Pre-Sales, Microsoft Business Division non-GAAP revenue increased 5%. During the quarter, we launched the new Office, enhancing productivity and the user experience through new mobility, social, and cloud features.
The Server & Tools business reported $5.04 billion of revenue, an 11% increase from the prior year period, driven by double-digit percentage revenue growth in SQL Server and System Center.
"Our enterprise business continues to thrive," said Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft. "Enterprise customers are increasingly turning to Microsoft for their IT solutions and as a result, we continue to take share from our competitors in key areas including hybrid cloud, data platform, and virtualization."
The Windows Division posted revenue of $5.70 billion, a 23% increase from the prior year period. Adjusting for the recognition of revenue related to the Windows Upgrade Offer, Windows Division non-GAAP revenue was flat. During the quarter, we added to the Surface family of devices with Surface Pro.
The Online Services Division reported revenue of $832 million, an 18% increase from the prior year period. Online advertising revenue grew 22% driven by an increase in revenue per search.
The Entertainment and Devices Division posted revenue of $2.53 billion, an increase of 56% from the prior year period. Adjusting for the recognition of revenue related to the Video Game Deferral, the division's non-GAAP revenue increased 33% for the third quarter. Xbox LIVE now has over 46 million members worldwide, an 18% increase from the prior year period.
"Our diverse business continues to deliver solid financial results, even as we navigate the evolving device market," said Peter Klein, chief financial officer at Microsoft. "Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in long-term growth opportunities to drive our devices and services strategy forward and deliver ongoing value to shareholders."
Business Outlook
Adjusting for the European Commission fine, Microsoft is revising operating expense guidance downward and now offers a range of $30.2 billion to $30.5 billion for the full year ending June 30, 2013. Microsoft also offers preliminary fiscal year 2014 operating expense guidance of $31.6 billion to $32.2 billion, representing 4 to 6% growth from the mid-point of fiscal year 2013 adjusted guidance.
CFO Transition
The company also announced Microsoft CFO Peter Klein will leave the company at the end of the current fiscal year, after nearly four years in role and 11 years at the company. Microsoft will be naming a new CFO from its finance leadership team in the next several weeks.
"It has been a pleasure to work with Peter as CFO," Ballmer said. "He's been a key member of my leadership team and a strategic advisor to me, and I wish him the very best."
"I've had a great experience as CFO and overall in my time at Microsoft," Klein said. "We have an incredibly strong finance organization, and I'm looking forward to working with my successor on the transition through the end of the fiscal year."

(b) No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof or suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission, and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Securities Act shall have been received;

(g) Since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there shall not have been a material adverse change in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (excluding any amendment or supplement thereto), the effect of which is in the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(h) On or after the date of this Agreement there shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Irish Stock Exchange; (ii) a suspension or material limitation in trading of any securities issued by the Company; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by Federal, New York State or European authorities; (iv) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war; or (v) the occurrence of any other calamity or crisis affecting the financial markets of the United States or member states of the European Union, if the effect of any such event specified in clause (iv) or (v) in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus;
(i) On or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Time of Delivery (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating assigned to the Company's debt securities by Standard and Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and (ii) neither of these rating organizations shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of the Company's debt securities, the effect of which, in any event specified in clause (i) or (ii), in the reasonable judgment of the Representatives, makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Disclosure Package and the Prospectus; and
(j) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Representatives at the Time of Delivery a certificate of the Company signed by an officer of the Company reasonably satisfactory to the Representatives as to (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein as of the Time of Delivery, (ii) the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the Time of Delivery and (iii) the matters set forth in Sections 7(b) and 7(g) hereof.
8. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
Indemnification and Contribution
 
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act) relating to the offering of the Securities, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any such issuer free writing prospectus, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of, or omission or alleged omission to state, a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; it being understood and agreed that the only written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any amendment or supplement thereto, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment thereto is the name of such Underwriter set forth on the cover page and the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph and the ninth, tenth and twenty-second paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting", in each case, in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
 
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 8(c), the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to not more than one separate local counsel in any jurisdiction in which the indemnified party requires representation by separate counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
provided
however
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
 
relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of
Defaulting Underwriters
 
such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
 
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but if for any other reason any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other hand, (ii) in connection with the offering contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction, each Underwriter is, and has been, acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company directly or indirectly, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed, or will assume, an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) and no Underwriter has any similar obligation to the Company with respect to the offering of the Securities contemplated hereby except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.
Nature of Underwriters' Obligations
13. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by any Representative and may assume that such statement, request, notice or agreement has been duly authorized by such Underwriter.
Authority of Representatives
14. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the addresses set forth on hereto; and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399, Attention: Corporate Vice President and Treasurer; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth on hereto, shall be provided to the Company by the Representatives upon request.

8. . (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment thereto, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any "issuer free writing prospectus" (as defined in Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act) relating to the offering of the Securities, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in the Registration
Indemnification and Contribution
provided
however
 
Statement, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, the Disclosure Package, or any such issuer free writing prospectus, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in Section 8(a) hereof, but only insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of, or omission or alleged omission to state, a material fact made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; it being understood and agreed that the only written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, the Base Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto is the name of such Underwriter set forth on the cover page and the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the third paragraph and the ninth, tenth and twentieth paragraphs under the caption "Underwriting", in each case, in the Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus and the Prospectus.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such Section 8(a) or 8(b), as the case may be, for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; , , that any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is
provided
however
 
understood that, notwithstanding the preceding sentence of this Section 8(c), the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to not more than one separate local counsel in any jurisdiction in which the indemnified party requires representation by separate counsel) for all such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement effected by an indemnified party without its prior written consent, but if the settlement is made with such consent, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under Section 8(c) hereof, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters, on the other, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 8(d). The amount paid or
 
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8(d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 8(d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company, each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and any other affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of the Company.
9. . (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representatives may in their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the Representatives notify the Company that the Representatives have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in the Representatives' opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section 9 with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
Defaulting Underwriters
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the Representatives and the Company as provided in Section 9(a) hereof, the aggregate principal amount of the Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, as referred to in Section 9(b) hereof, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in Section 9(b) hereof to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
10. . The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
Survival
11. . If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof; but if for any other reason any Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the Representatives for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 6 and 8 hereof.
Termination
12. . The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the public offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and

13. . In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the Company shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly or by any Representative and may assume that such statement, request, notice or agreement has been duly authorized by such Underwriter.
Authority of Representatives
14. . All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing, and if to the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to the Representatives at the addresses set forth on hereto; and if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent by facsimile transmission or registered mail to Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington 98052-6399, Attention: Corporate Vice President and Treasurer; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by registered mail to such Underwriter at its address which, if not set forth on hereto, shall be provided to the Company by the Representatives upon request.
