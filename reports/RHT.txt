In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, Red Hat achieved revenue of $27.2 million, a sequential increase of 5% compared to $25.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, and a year-over-year increase of 39%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the company achieved net income of $1.5 million, or $0.01 per share. This compares to a net loss of $273,000, or break-even per share, in the prior quarter, and a net loss of $4.6 million, or $0.03 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The company generated $5.5 million in positive cash flows from operations during the first quarter, which represents its fourth consecutive quarter of positive cash flows from operations. The company ended the first quarter with a cash and investments balance of $300 million, a sequential increase of $7.7 million and a year-over-year increase of $13.5 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the company increased its deferred revenue balance to $24.1 million, an increase of $6.3 million, or 36% as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, and an increase of $14.8 million or 159% as compared to the same prior year quarter.

Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Continues Scale Out of Open Source Architecture with Sistina Acquisition RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--xx--Red Hat, Inc. (Nasdaq:RHAT), the world's premier open source solution provider to the enterprise, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sistina Software, a leading storage infrastructure software company. Concurrent with Red Hat's Open Source Architecture strategy, the acquisition will provide Enterprise Linux customers a path to virtualization and vendor-independent storage solutions. "With enterprise class storage management capabilities in place, Linux operating environments look more trustworthy than ever," said John Webster of the Data Mobility Group(1). Sistina is a leader in what industry data estimate a $2 billion storage infrastructure marketplace. Sistina's storage infrastructure software is the foundation for building, integrating and deploying data-sharing storage solutions across the enterprise. Solutions include: -- Sistina GFS, the industry's most advanced and mature scalable file system -- Logical Volume Manager (LVM), a major building block in Linux that enables enterprise-level disk volume management by grouping arbitrary physical disks into virtual disk volumes -- Sistina GFS for Oracle9i RAC, a solution designed to specifically reduce the complexity of implementing and maintaining an Oracle9i RAC system "The acquisition of the Sistina technology and world class development team, in close collaboration with the open source community, will greatly accelerate the availability and advancement of open source storage solutions for the enterprise," said Paul Cormier, Executive vice president of Engineering at Red Hat. Sistina's engineering team, consisting of industry experts in clustering and virtualization, will augment Red Hat's development efforts. The integrated team will work to make all of Sistina's technologies open source and available as a part of a subscription in the first half of 2004. Red Hat's acquisition of Sistina is expected to be completed in early January at a purchase price of approximately $31M to be paid through issuance of Red Hat common stock.

On December 17, 2003, Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Wild Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger Sub") and Sistina Software, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Sistina"), providing for the merger of the Merger Sub with and into Sistina with Sistina as the surviving entity. The transaction closed on December 23, 2003. At the effective time of the transaction,
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Red Hat acquired Sistina for consideration at closing valued at $31.0 million and comprised of 1,979,874 shares of Red Hat common stock, the assumption of Sistina's outstanding options and warrants and a nominal amount of cash to avoid the issuance of fractional shares. In addition, the transaction includes $12.0 million of contingent consideration based on an earnout carved into three tranches. The earnout is based on the achievement of certain bookings targets for the technologies and services previously sold by Sistina over the period beginning on December 23, 2003 and ending March 31, 2005. Shares issued under the earnout will be determined based on the average closing price of the Company's common stock during the 10 trading days prior to issuance of each tranche of such earnout shares.
 
For United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement be adopted by the Parties as a plan of reorganization.
 
The terms of the transaction are more fully described in the Stock Purchase Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and incorporated herein by this reference.
 
The terms of the Merger Agreement were determined on the basis of arms-length negotiations. Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates, nor any director or officer of the Company or any associate of any such director or officer, had any material relationship with Sistina.
 
Sistina is a storage infrastructure software company. The Company currently intends to continue to use the tangible assets of Sistina constituting equipment or other physical property substantially in the same manner in which they were used by Sistina immediately prior to the merger.

Dissenting Shares
 
(a) Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Shares, unless such Company Stockholder shall have forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation Law or properly withdrawn his, her or its demand for appraisal. If such Company Stockholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then (i) as of the occurrence of such event, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger Shares issuable in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 1.5, and (ii) promptly following the occurrence of such event, the Buyer shall deliver to such Company Stockholder a certificate representing 90% of the Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5 (which shares shall be considered Initial Shares for all purposes of this Agreement) and shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate representing the remaining 10% of the Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.5 (which shares shall be considered Escrow Shares for all purposes of this Agreement).

In lieu of any fractional Initial Shares that would have otherwise been issued, each former Company Stockholder that would have been entitled to receive a fractional Initial Share from the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary shall, upon proper surrender of such person's Certificates, receive a cash payment equal to the closing price per share of the Buyer Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market, as reported by Nasdaq, on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, multiplied by the fraction of a share that such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive.

(a) As of the Effective Time, all Options, whether vested or unvested, and the Option Plan, insofar as it relates to Options outstanding under such Plan as of the Closing, shall be assumed by the Buyer. Immediately after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Option at the Effective Time (i) such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Common Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number), plus (ii) if, during the Initial Earn-Out Period, the Buyer achieves Bookings of at least $1,500,000, such number of shares of
 
Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Initial Earn-out Share Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number), plus (iii) if, during the Second Earn-Out Period, the Buyer achieves Bookings of at least $2,000,000, such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Second Earn-out Share Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number) and plus (iv) if, during the Full Earn-Out Period, the Buyer achieves Bookings of at least $7,000,000, such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Full Earn-out Share Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number). The exercise price per share of each such assumed Option shall be equal to the exercise price of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Common Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The term, exercisability, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, and all of the other terms of the Options shall otherwise remain unchanged.

The exercise price per share of each such assumed Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price of such Warrant immediately prior to the
 
Effective Time, divided by the Common Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The term, exercisability, vesting schedule and all of the other terms of the Warrants shall otherwise remain unchanged. In the event any such Warrant is exercised prior to issuance of the Initial Earn-out Shares, the Second Earn-out Shares or the Full Earn-out Shares, as the case may be, the Earn-out Shares issuable to such Warrant holder with respect to the portion of the Warrant so exercised shall be issued to the such Warrant holder at the time of issuance of the Initial Earn-out Shares, the Second Earn-out Shares or the Full Earn-out Shares, as the case may be.

(d) The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Options and Warrants assumed in accordance with this Section 1.8. Within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act with respect to all shares of Buyer Common Stock subject to such Options that may be registered on a Form S-8 (the "Eligible Option Shares"), and shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement for so long as such Options remain outstanding.
 
(e) The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing, the consent from each holder of an Option or a Warrant to the amendment of such Option or Warrant pursuant to this Section 1.8 (unless such consent is not required under the terms of the applicable agreement, instrument or plan).

(iii) The Earn-out Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this Agreement, including the provisions of this Section 1.13(e), or (y) address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties.
 
(iv) The fees and expenses of the Earn-Out Arbitrator in connection with the resolutions of disputes pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be shared equally by the Company Stockholders on the one hand and the Buyer on the other, provided that, if the Earn-Out Arbitrator determines that one party has adopted a position(s) that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the Earn-Out Arbitrator may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of such fees and expenses to such party.
 
(f) In order to support and facilitate the attainment of Bookings, the Buyer agrees, through the term of the Full Earn-out Period, to maintain four (4) fully dedicated sales personnel (provided, however that through March 31, 2004 the Buyer shall maintain five (5)
 
fully dedicated sales personnel) and that 16 of the Buyer's other sales personnel will be trained, at least once a calendar quarter, to sell the Products and Services. All of the Buyer's sales personnel shall be compensated on the same basis for the sale of the Products and Services as such personnel are compensated for the sale of the Buyer's other products and services. Buyer agrees that the price for the sale by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any single node of the Products and Services shall be at a price of at least $1,000. All sales of Products and Services for more than a single node shall be sold with discounts off of list price that are consistent with the discounts off of list price offered by the Buyer in the sales of its other similar products and services. Buyer shall offer the Products and Services to potential partners for redistribution at substantially similar pricing discounts as it offers its other similar products to these partners. In the event Buyer is in material breach of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 1.13(f) and does not cure such breach within thirty (30) days after notice from the Indemnification Representatives, the Buyer shall issue to the Company Stockholders all of the Earn-Out Shares issuable with respect to those Earn-out Periods that have not expired as of the date of such material breach.
 
(g) Except as provided in Section 1.13(f) above, the Company agrees and acknowledges that the Buyer may make from time to time such business decisions as it deems appropriate in the conduct of the Buyer's business, including actions that may have an impact on Bookings, and the Company Stockholders will have no right to claim any lost earn-out or other damages as a result of such decisions so long as the actions were not taken by the Buyer in bad faith for the principal purpose of frustrating provisions of this Section.
 
(h) The applicable Earn-out Shares shall be issued within five (5) days after (i) the expiration of the ten (10) day period for giving an Earn-out Dispute Notice, if no Earn-out Dispute Notice is given, or (ii) the resolution of the applicable Earn-out Dispute pursuant to this Section 1.13.
 
(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional Earn-out Shares shall be issued to Company Stockholders, and such Company Stockholders shall not be entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions or other rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any fractional Earn-out Shares that would have otherwise been issued to such Company Stockholders. In lieu of any fractional Earn-out Shares that would have otherwise been issued, each Company Stockholder that would have been entitled to receive a fractional Earn-out Share shall receive a cash payment equal to the closing price per share of the Buyer Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market, as reported by Nasdaq, on the business day immediately preceding the issuance of such Earn-out Share, multiplied by the fraction of a share that such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive. In the event the Buyer is acquired prior to the expiration of the Full Earn-out Period, then after the date of any such acquisition, in lieu of receiving shares of Buyer Common Stock under this Section 1.13, the Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive as consideration, to the extent Earn-Out Shares are earned hereunder, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which the Company Stockholders would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such acquisition if such Earn-out Shares had been issued immediately prior to such acquisition, which consideration, in the case of securities, shall be subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split or similar event affecting such securities between the date of such acquisition and the issuance date.
 
1.14 . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Buyer, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to deduct and withhold Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder (including any payments to be made under the Escrow Agreement) if such withholding is required by law and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Company Stockholders and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Company Stockholder or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation shall deduct and withhold the Tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code on excess parachute payments in the event the required stockholder vote referred to in Section 4.14 of this Agreement is not successfully obtained.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' deficit and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sistina Software, Inc. and its subsidiary (a development stage enterprise) at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended and, cumulatively, for the period from August 1, 1997 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
As discussed in Note 1, the Company was acquired by Red Hat, Inc. on December 23, 2003.

Description of Business
Sistina Software, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on August 1, 1997. The Company designs, develops and supports storage management software for the Linux operating system, including the Global File System ("GFS"), the Logical Volume Manager ("LVM") and the Cluster Logical Volume Manager ("CLVM"). The Company's storage clustering technology can be used to increase system performance, availability and scalability for applications including file, web and mail serving and to simplify storage management by consolidating storage into pools which may be easily shared, resized and replicated. From its inception to December 31, 2002, the Company devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets and raising capital and was considered to be in the development stage. The Company is considered to have emerged from the development stage during the unaudited nine month period ended September 30, 2003. Because the emergence from the development stage occurred subsequent to the initial issuance of the Company's December 31, 2002 audited financial statements, these disclosures remain in these 2002 statements. These disclosures have not been updated for the 2003 nine-month period as this period is considered to be outside the development stage.
 
Acquisition of Sistina Software, Inc.
 
At December 23, 2003, the Company was acquired by Red Hat, Inc., a publicly-traded software company. The previously issued Report of Independent Auditors included an emphasis of a matter paragraph, in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards ("SAS 58"), , relating to Sistina's need to raise additional financing to support 2004's operations. This matter has been resolved with the acquisition by Red Hat, Inc.
Reporting on Audited Financial Statements
 
 
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly state the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the unaudited periods presented. These adjustments consist of normal, recurring items. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results in future periods may differ from those estimates. The unaudited results of operations for the period ended September 30, 2003, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for the entire fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. The unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes do not contain certain information included in the Company's annual financial statements and notes.
 
Consolidation Principles
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Sistina Software, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid investments in money market funds or other investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
Trade Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at fair value upon the sale of goods or services to customers. To date, the Company has not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The recorded amounts of financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value, based upon the Company's incremental borrowing rate or due to the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization.
 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Significant additions or improvements are capitalized; normal maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, currently three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the underlying lease term. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or disposed of are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is included in operations.
 
Revenue Recognition
Prior to August 2001, the Company provided the GFS and LVM source code to customers free of charge under the GNU General Public License. The Company's strategy was to generate revenues from commercial software tools and other services while striving to achieve a new standard with its product. From August 2001 to November 2001, all versions of GFS were released under a new Sistina Public License which enabled the Company to charge certain individuals or entities a licensing fee for certain commercial uses of the software. Starting in December 2001, all new versions of GFS were licensed under proprietary licenses, which enables the Company to charge all individuals or entities a licensing fee. Revenues prior to December 2001 were primarily service-related and included providing technical support and maintenance, systems installation and integration, customer training and education, and other services supporting its GFS and LVM products.
 
The Company records revenues in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, , as amended by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, as well as Technical Practice Aids issued from time to time by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Software Revenue Recognition
 
Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement has been received, the product has been delivered, the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable. When significant post-delivery obligations exist, revenues are deferred until fulfillment of all revenue recognition requirements. Revenue under multiple-element arrangements, which may include several software products, services, third-party software, hardware and customer support sold together, is allocated to each element based upon the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized as discussed below. The Company has established sufficient vendor-
 
Sistina Software, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
specific objective evidence of fair value for customer support and other professional services based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately. Accordingly, software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery under the residual method in arrangements in which the software is licensed with other elements, provided the undelivered elements of the arrangements are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
 
Revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period. Revenues from other support services are recognized as the services are performed.
 
Research and Development
Expenditures for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Software development costs related to the initial development of the Company's product and subsequent enhancements have been charged to expense as incurred. Such costs, and costs related to development of new software products, are required to be capitalized once technological feasibility and proven marketability of the product are established. To date, software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.
 
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, , and related interpretations, and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, . Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. No compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted to employees since inception. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to non-employees using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The Company has implemented the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, .

The table below illustrates the effect on net income (loss) if the fair value of options granted to employees under the Company's stock option plan had been recognized as compensation expense in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. See Note 7 for additional information regarding the plan.
 
 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Comprehensive Income
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, , a standard requiring the reporting and display of "comprehensive income" (defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from sources other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners) and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. During the cumulative period from August 1, 1997 (date of inception) to December 31, 2000, the Company did not have any changes in stockholders' equity from nonowner sources other than the respective periods' net loss. For the subsequent periods, comprehensive loss for the Company includes the period's net loss and the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments.
Reporting Comprehensive Income
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, . This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The statement amends the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, , and complies with the disclosure provisions of FASB Statement No. 123. The transition provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company has implemented the year-end disclosure provisions as of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
December 31, 2002, and the interim period disclosures as presented previously in this note under Stock-Based Compensation. The Company currently does not plan to change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. As a result, the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, . FIN No. 46 requires certain variable interest entities, or VIEs, to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN No. 46 is effective for all VIEs created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For VIEs created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN No. 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2003. The Company currently has no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, if the Company enters into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future, the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations may be adversely effected.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, . This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability. Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This statement is effective in 2004 and is expected to cause the Company to reclassify its redeemable preferred stock to a liability and all accretion or other changes in carrying value to its preferred stock to be reflected as interest expense or income.

Accrued liabilities consist of the following:
 
 
 
In September 1997, a subordinated promissory note for $75,000 was entered into with a relative of the founder and then sole director of the Company. The note provided for interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum, with principal and accrued interest due on demand, and was convertible into common stock. In October 1997, the note, along with accrued interest of $564, was retired and the note holder was issued 326,760 shares of common stock.
 
In February and March 2000, the Company entered into two subordinated promissory notes, one with a director of the Company and one with a relative of the Company's founder, for a total amount of $100,000. The notes provided for interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum, with principal and accrued interest due on demand, and were convertible into common stock. In April 2000, these notes, along with accrued interest of $855, were retired and the note holders were issued 112,061 shares of common stock.
 
In August 2001, a subordinated promissory note for $2,000,000 was entered into with the primary preferred stockholder of the Company. This note provides for interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum, with principal and interest originally due on October 31, 2001. The principal balance was originally convertible into Series B convertible redeemable preferred stock at the closing price of the Series B financing, as long as the Series B financing closed prior to October 31, 2001, and resulted in aggregate cash proceeds to the Company of at least $8,000,000. Upon maturity, because the Series B financing had not yet occurred, the note holder had the option to convert the outstanding principal balance into the Company's common stock at $1 per share or receive cash. In addition, the Company was required to issue warrants to the note holder to purchase 600,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $0.01 per share (Note 7).
 
During 2002, the $2,000,000 note, along with $346,039 of total cumulative accrued interest and $3,875,000 of additional principal, was replaced on four separate occasions with new subordinated promissory notes, with the latest promissory note for $6,221,039 issued in November 2002. The principal and interest on this latest note were originally due on December 9, 2002, and the note was collateralized by substantially all assets and intellectual property of the Company. The remaining terms of the latest note are substantially the same as the terms of the original $2,000,000 note. In addition, in connection with the issuance of additional principal during 2002, the Company was required to issue warrants to the note holder to purchase 968,750 shares of the Company's common stock at $0.01 per share (Note 7).
 
Sistina Software, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
At December 31, 2002, the principal and accrued interest balances remained outstanding. In January 2003, $600,193 of the note payable was converted to Series B convertible redeemable preferred stock, and the remaining outstanding principal balance was recognized as a gain on extinguishment of debt (Note 8).
 
In January 2003, a subordinated promissory note for $200,000 was entered into with the primary preferred stockholder of the Company. This note provided for interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum, with principal and interest due on January 31, 2003. The principal balance was converted into Series B convertible redeemable preferred stock at the closing price of the Series B financing.
 
See Note 8 for gain on debt extinguishment.
 
 
The Company has authorized several series of convertible redeemable preferred stock. The title, carrying amount, and number of shares issued and outstanding are as follows:
 
 
Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
In December 2000, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the offering of 4,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Concurrent with this authorization, the Company issued 42,882 shares of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock to a single venture capital investor at a price of $58.30 per share.
 
In February 2001, the Company issued an additional 14,738 shares of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock to various investors at a price of $58.30 per share.
 
As more fully described in Note 8, in January 2003 all shares of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock were converted to common stock.
 
Sistina Software, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The terms of the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock are as follows:
 
Voting Rights
The holders of the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock are entitled to vote, together with the holders of common stock, on all matters submitted to stockholders for a vote. The preferred stockholders are entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which each preferred share is convertible at the time of such vote.
 
Dividends
The holders of the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock are entitled to receive, when and if declared by the Board of Directors and out of funds legally available, noncumulative dividends at the rate of $5.83 per share per annum, payable in preference and priority to payment of any dividend on common stock. Through December 31, 2002, no dividends have been declared or paid by the Company.
 
Liquidation Preference
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock are entitled to a per share distribution in preference to common stockholders of $116.60 per share, plus all declared but unpaid dividends. After this distribution, the remaining assets, if any, shall be distributed to the common stockholders.
 
Conversion
Each share of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holders, into a specified number of shares of common stock based on a conversion ratio, subject to adjustment under specified terms and conditions (58.3-for-1 at December 31, 2002). Certain terms exist to protect these conversion rights in the event of further issuances of common stock or a merger or reorganization of the Company.
 
In the event of a public offering of the Company's common stock at a price of at least $233.20 per share with gross proceeds of at least $20,000,000, all shares of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the effective conversion ratio.
 
Mandatory Redemption
The Company is required to offer to redeem the outstanding shares of Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock in two equal annual installments in December 2006 and 2007. Such redemption shall be at $103.19 per share in the case of the December 2006 redemption date and $113.69 per share in the case of the December 2007 redemption date. The carrying value of the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock is being accreted to its redemption value over the period from issuance to redemption using the effective interest method. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the carrying amount includes $738,244 and $370,471, respectively, of value accreted to the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock since its issuance.

Conversion
Each share of Series B-1 convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holders, into a specified number of shares of common stock based on a conversion ratio, which is initially 1-for-1. Each share of Series B-2 convertible redeemable preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holders, into a specified number of shares of Series B-1 convertible redeemable preferred stock based on a conversion ratio, which is initially 1-for-1. Certain terms exist to protect these conversion rights in the event of further issuances of common stock or a merger or reorganization of the Company. In the event of a public offering of the Company's common stock at a price of at least $2.50 per share with gross proceeds of at least $40,000,000, all shares of Series B convertible redeemable preferred stock will automatically be converted into shares of common stock at the effective conversion ratio.

Common Stock Restriction Agreements
In March 2000, the Company issued a total of 1,647 shares of common stock under stock restriction agreements to two directors at a price of $13.48 per share. The restrictions lapse monthly over a 24-month period from issuance, and all of the unvested shares immediately vest upon a change of control, as defined. Under the stock restriction agreements, if the directors cease serving on the Company's Board of Directors or attempt to transfer or dispose of any restricted common stock, the Company has the option to repurchase any unvested shares at the original sale price per share. In October 2000, one of the directors resigned from the Board of Directors and the Company waived its right to repurchase the unvested shares.
 
In March 2002, the Company issued 4,915 shares of common stock under a stock restriction agreement to one of its executives at a price of $17.49 per share. The restriction was to lapse monthly over a 48-month period from issuance, and all of the unvested shares were to immediately vest upon a change in control, as defined. Under the stock restriction agreement, if the executive ceased employment or attempted to transfer or dispose of any restricted common stock, the Company had the option to repurchase any unvested shares at the original sale price per share. In exchange for this restricted common stock, the Company received a note receivable from the executive for $85,960, of which $68,768 was nonrecourse and $17,192 was collateralized by the personal assets of the executive. The note bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.43 percent per annum

The interest due on the note was considered part of the stock purchase price, and both the principal and interest components of the note were classified as reductions of stockholders' equity. In December 2002, the 4,915 shares of restricted common stock were cancelled, the payments received to date by the Company were returned to the executive, and the entire amount of the note and interest receivable was forgiven. The portion of the total shares deemed to be purchased with the nonrecourse note was considered a cancellation of a stock option. Stock-based compensation expense resulting from this transaction during the year ended December 31, 2002, was $17,254.
 
 
Stock Option Plan
The Company maintains the 1997 Omnibus Stock Plan (the "Plan"), which was approved by the stockholders in May 1998. The Plan provides for the issuance of both incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards and other performance-based awards to employees and others providing services to the Company, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2002, 68,611 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the Plan.
 
Through December 31, 2002, 58,446 options have been granted to employees of the Company and 8,131 options have been granted to nonemployees, all with exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of Directors. The typical vesting terms for grants to employees include 25 percent vesting one year after the grant date with the remainder of the shares vesting ratably over the next 36 months. Certain of the Company's initial grants to employees included 25 percent vesting after less than one year. Generally, the options expire ten years from the date of grant.

The minimum value of each option grant to employees is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: a risk-free interest rate equal to the U.S. Treasury "Strip" rate on the date of grant, an expected life of six years and no volatility or expected dividend yield.
 
The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the cumulative period from August 1, 1999 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002, was $4.15, $5.03 and $5.09, respectively. For the unaudited nine month period ending September 30, 2003, the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted to employees was $0.01.
 
Stock Options Issued to Nonemployees
In June 1999, the Company granted options to purchase 1,235 shares of common stock at $13.41 per share to a nonemployee in exchange for services.

Certain of these options were immediately vested and the remaining options vest within 24 months from the grant date. The Company is accounting for these options in accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-18, . The fair value of the options is being determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following assumptions: a risk-free interest rate equal to the U.S. Treasury "Strip" rate on the valuation date, an expected life equal to the contractual life of ten years, no expected dividend yield and volatility of 50 percent. Stock-based compensation expense related to these options issued to nonemployees recognized during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the cumulative period from August 1, 1997 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002, was $10,972, $39,905 and $87,538, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to these options issued to nonemployees recognized during the unaudited nine month period ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, was $1,722 and $12,034, respectively.

In September 2000, the Company granted immediately exercisable warrants to purchase 515 shares of common stock at $58.25 per share to a nonemployee in exchange for services. These warrants expire five years from the date of grant. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $30,000, the fair value of the services received, during the cumulative period from August 1, 1997 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002, because it was more reliably measurable than the fair value of the equity instruments issued.
 
In August 2001, as additional consideration for a preferred stockholder providing bridge financing to the Company, warrants to purchase 10,292 shares of common stock at $0.5830 per share were issued to the preferred stockholder. Pursuant to the agreement, the recipient of the warrants had an immediate right to purchase 8,577 shares of common stock, and the right to the remaining 1,715 vested on October 31, 2001.

As a result of these conversions, all previous stockholders and option and warrant holders were issued 499,857 shares of new common stock, which represents 4.6 percent of the total outstanding capital stock of the Company following the initial issuances of the Series B convertible redeemable preferred stock in January and February 2003.

All references in the financial statements to common stock shares issued or outstanding, prices per share and stock option and warrant data and Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock reflect the reverse split/conversions as if these had occurred at the Company's inception.
 
 
As a result of the 2003 recapitalization (Note 8) and related financings, the Company underwent a change in ownership (Note 9), as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). As a result of this transaction and pursuant to the requirements of Section 382 of the IRC, substantially all of the Company's net operating loss and credit carryforwards are no longer available to offset future taxable income. Future changes in ownership may result in additional limitations to net operating loss carryforwards.
 
At December 31, 2002, prior to the change in ownership, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $11,100,000, which expire at various dates between 2012 and 2022.
 
The primary components of the Company's deferred tax assets at December 31 are as follows:
 
 
The Company has recognized a valuation allowance for the entire tax benefit associated with the carryforwards and other deferred tax assets at December 31, 2002 and 2001, as their utilization is not considered more likely than not based on the weight of available information.

The cumulative rent expense for the period from August 1, 1997 (date of inception) to December 31, 2002, was $335,739.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 30, 2003, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended February 28, 2003 and the nine months ended November 30, 2003 combine the historical Red Hat and Sistina balance sheets and statements of operations as if the acquisition of Sistina, which occurred on December 24, 2003, had been completed on November 30, 2003 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Balance Sheet, and as of March 1, 2002 and March 1, 2003 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
We acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Sistina, which included the assumption of all stock options and stock warrants on December 23, 2003 in exchange for the issuance of 1,979,874 shares of our common stock. The total purchase price of the Sistina acquisition was approximately $31.0 million and has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. At closing, we issued 1,979,874 shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately $31.0 million to the stockholders of Sistina. In addition, the transaction includes $12.0 million of contingent consideration based on an earnout carved into three tranches. The earnout is based on the achievement of certain bookings targets for the technologies and services previously sold by Sistina over the period commencing December 23, 2003 and ending March 31, 2005. Shares issued under the earnout will be determined based on the average closing price of the Company's common stock during the 10 trading days prior to issuance of each tranche of such earnout shares. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements including the notes to these statements of Red Hat and the historical financial statements of Sistina.
 
The pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Sistina acquisition are based on the purchase method of accounting, available financial information, and certain estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Financial Statements. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Financial Statements reflects our best estimates based on preliminary information. The final purchase price allocation and the actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to various factors, including, without limitation, access to additional financial information and changes in value based on a final purchase price allocation determined by an independent valuation expert. The valuation will result in some amount, which may be significant, allocated to identifiable intangibles, which we expect to be amortized over a period between three to five years. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be achievable with respect to the combined business of Red Hat and Sistina.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 28, 2003 and as of and for the nine months ended November 30, 2003, do not purport to represent what the actual financial condition or results of operations of the combined businesses would have been if the acquisition of Sistina had occurred on the dates indicated in these pro forma combined financial statements nor does this information purport to project our results or financial position for any future periods.

RALEIGH, N.C., Jan. 6, 2004  Red Hat, Inc. (Nasdaq: RHAT) today announced the pricing of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2024, which are being issued in a private offering.
 
The debentures are being sold at 100% of their principal amount. The sale of the debentures is expected to close on January 12, 2004, subject to customary closing conditions. The initial purchaser has an option to purchase up to an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures. The debentures will be Red Hat's senior unsecured obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all of its existing and future secured debt. Red Hat expects to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including possible acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies and the expansion of its international operations.
 
The debentures will bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per annum, payable on each January 15 and July 15, beginning on July 15, 2004. The debentures will mature on January 15, 2024, unless earlier converted, redeemed by Red Hat at its option or repurchased by Red Hat at the option of the holders. Each $1,000 principal amount of the debentures will be initially convertible under certain circumstances into 39.0753 shares of Red Hat common stock. Therefore, the debentures are convertible in the aggregate into approximately 19,537,650 shares of Red Hat common stock, or approximately 23,445,180 shares of Red Hat common stock if the initial purchaser exercises its option to purchase additional debentures in full. The conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share, subject to adjustment. This represents approximately a 37% conversion premium based on the last reported bid price of $18.68 of Red Hat common stock on January 6, 2004. The debentures will be redeemable by Red Hat beginning in January 2009 and investors will have the right to require Red Hat to repurchase the debentures in January 2009, 2014 and 2019 and upon certain repurchase events.
 
The debentures have been offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The debentures and the shares of Red Hat common stock issuable upon the conversion of the debentures have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to a U.S. person absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
 
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering would be unlawful.

On January 6, 2004, Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Red Hat"), issued a press release to announce the pricing of $500 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due 2024 (the "Debentures"), to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (plus up to an additional $100 million pursuant to an option granted to the initial purchaser). Red Hat will pay a 0.50% per annum interest rate on the principal amount, payable semi-annually on each January 15 and July 15 beginning on July 15, 2004. The Debentures are convertible into shares of Red Hat common stock at an initial conversion rate of 39.0753 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures (which represents a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share) under certain conditions and subject to certain adjustments. Additional information about the Debentures is included in the press release, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
Red Hat, Inc. is filing this Current Report on Form 8-K for the purpose of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission an updated description of our capital stock as set forth below.
 
 
The following description of our capital stock summarizes the material terms and provisions of these securities. For the complete terms of our capital stock, please refer to our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated By-laws, as amended. The terms of our capital stock may also be affected by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
GENERAL
 
We are authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. As of November 30, 2003, there were:
 
 
 
 
COMMON STOCK
 
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in such election. When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, any matter to be voted upon by the stockholders at such meeting is decided by a majority of the votes of the shares present or represented and voting on the matter.
Voting.
 
Holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any, as may be declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor, after provision has been made for any preferential dividend rights of any outstanding preferred stock.
Dividends.
 
Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably our net assets available after the payment of all our debts and other liabilities, and after the satisfaction of the rights of any outstanding preferred stock.
Liquidation and dissolution.
 
Holders of the common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights, nor are they entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund. The outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The rights, powers, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subordinate to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we may designate and issue in the future.
Other rights and restrictions.
 
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "RHAT."
Listing.
The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Mellon Investor Services, LLC.
Transfer agent and registrar.
 
PREFERRED STOCK
 
Our board of directors is authorized, without further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series. Each series of preferred stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the board of directors, which may include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights.
 
Our stockholders have granted the board of directors authority to issue the preferred stock and to determine its rights and preferences in order to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subordinate to the rights of holders of any preferred stock issued in the future.
 
The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings, and other corporate purposes, could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock, and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. We have not, to date, issued any shares of such preferred stock.
 
DELAWARE LAW AND SPECIFIED CHARTER AND BY-LAW PROVISIONS
 
We are subject to the provisions of section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A "business combination" includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An "interested stockholder" is defined as a person who, at the time of determination whether a person is an interested stockholder,
 
 
 
Our charter provides for the division of the board of directors into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three-year terms. In addition, our charter provides that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote. Under our charter, unless or until filled by our stockholders, any vacancy on the board of directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, may only be filled by vote of a majority of the directors then in office. The likely effect of the classification of the board of directors and the limitations on the removal of directors and filling of vacancies is an increase in the time required for the stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors. For example, because only approximately one-third of the directors may be replaced by stockholder vote at each annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders seeking to replace a majority of the members of the board of directors will need at least two annual meetings of stockholders to effect this change.
Classification of Board of Directors.
Our charter contains provisions permitted under the General Corporation Law of Delaware relating to the liability of directors. The provisions eliminate a director's liability for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty, except (i) for a breach of a director's duty of loyalty, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) transactions from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Furthermore, our by-laws contain provisions requiring us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions do not limit or eliminate our right or the right of any of our stockholders to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach by a director or an officer of his or her duty of care.
Limitation of liability; indemnification.
 
Our charter also provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if it is properly brought before the meeting and may not be taken by written action in lieu of a meeting. Our charter and by-laws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by a majority of the board of directors, the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president. Our by-laws further provide that in order for any matter to be considered "properly brought" before a meeting, a stockholder must comply with specified procedural requirements regarding advance notice. The foregoing provisions could have the effect of delaying until the next stockholders meeting stockholder actions which are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. These provisions may also discourage another person or entity from making a tender offer for our common stock, because such person or entity, even if it acquired a majority of our outstanding voting securities, would be able to take action as a stockholder, such as electing new directors or approving a merger, only at a duly called stockholders meeting, and not by written consent.
Stockholder action; special meetings of stockholders; advance notice requirements.
 
The General Corporation Law of Delaware provides that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage. Our charter requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the shares of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote to amend or repeal any of the foregoing provisions of our charter. Our by-laws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of the board of directors except for provisions relating to the board of directors, which may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the shares of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Our by-laws may also be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the shares of our capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. The 75% stockholder vote would be in addition to any separate class vote that might in the future be required in accordance with the terms of any series of preferred stock that might be outstanding at the time any such amendments are submitted to stockholders.

The information filed pursuant to Item 12 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.2, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

RED HAT, INC. By: /s/ Mark H. Webbink -------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark H. Webbink Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary Date: March 23 , 2004
Exhibit Index Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Risk Factors 99.2 Press Release dated March 23, 2004

Exhibit 99.1 RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on the support of Linux developers not employed by us for improvements and advancement of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux technologies. We may not be able to release major product releases and upgrades of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a timely basis because the heart of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Linux kernel, is maintained by third parties. Linus Torvalds, the original developer of the Linux kernel, and a small group of engineers, many of whom are not employed by us, are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the Linux kernel. If this group of developers fails to further develop the Linux kernel or if Mr. Torvalds or prominent Linux developers who are members of this group and are currently employed by us were to join one of our competitors, no longer be employed by us or no longer work on the Linux kernel, we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves. We cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources. We could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts, which would increase our development expenses and may delay our product release and upgrade schedules. In addition, any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional Linux-based applications. If we fail to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry-leading companies, we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base. Our success depends in part on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry-leading hardware manufacturers (such as Hewlett-Packard, Dell, IBM, Fujitsu and others), distributors, software vendors (such as Oracle) and enterprise solutions providers. These relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts. We may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms. In addition, our existing strategic relationships do not, and any future strategic relationships may not, afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights. As a result, many of the companies with which we have strategic alliances pursue alternative technologies and develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing, and technical support. If third-party enterprise software application providers do not continue to make their new applications compatible with our Linux-based operating systems, our software will cease to be competitive. Our products will not be competitive unless new enterprise software applications continue to be compatible with our Linux-based operating systems. We intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on Linux-based operating systems by attracting third-party developers to the Linux platform, providing open source tools to create these applications and maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support for third-party developers. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, however, our products will not be competitive and our sales growth will be adversely affected. We may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development, which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation. We do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology. Different groups of open source software programmers compete with one another to develop new technology. Typically, the technology developed by one group will become more widely used than that developed by others. If we adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products and competing technology becomes more widely used or accepted, the market appeal of our products may be reduced and that could harm our reputation, diminish the Red Hat brand and result in decreased revenue. There are few technology barriers to entry in the open source market. One of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone can modify the existing software or develop new software that competes with existing
open source software. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. It is possible for a competitor with greater resources than ours to develop its own open source operating system solution, potentially reducing the demand for our solutions. We have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions, which may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention. We have acquired several businesses, including, most recently, Sistina Software, Inc. on December 23, 2003. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future. We have limited experience in making acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including: the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies; the maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; the impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel; the inability to maintain a relationship with clients of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services; the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; expenses related to the acquisition; potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses; and unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions. In addition, with future acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price. We could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution, or incur substantial debt. Any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue for us. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. We have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years. For example, our aggregate revenues increased from approximately $65.0 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2002 to approximately $89.1 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2003. As of November 30, 2003, we had 602 employees, up from 569 as of November 30, 2002. In addition, we continue to explore ways to extend our product and service offerings, and geographic reach. Our growth has placed and may continue to place a strain on our management systems, information systems, resources and internal controls. Our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan requires adequate information systems and resources and oversight from our senior management. We have, with our audit committee, undertaken to review and improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. We will need to continue to modify and improve these controls, systems and procedures and other internal controls and compliance procedures as we continue to grow and expand our business. As we grow, we must also continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We may not be able to hire, train, supervise and manage sufficient personnel or develop management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively. If we are unable to manage our growth and improve our controls, systems and procedures, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION We have incurred substantial net losses on a GAAP basis in the past and may not be able to maintain profitability. We have incurred net losses in seven of our previous eight fiscal years, including our most recent fiscal year ended February 28, 2003. As of November 30, 2003, we had an accumulated deficit of $281.4 million. While we have achieved profitability in the first nine months of the last fiscal year, we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability. Failure to remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations. You should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results.
Due to the unpredictability of the technology spending environment, our revenue and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue. Our expenses are, to a large extent, fixed in the short term. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to protect our projected operating results for a quarter if our revenue in that quarter falls short of our expectations. If our future operating results fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline. We may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers, which could adversely affect revenue. Historically, we focused our sales and marketing efforts on product sales to individuals. In late fiscal 2002, we began to focus the predominant portion of our sales and marketing efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base. To this end, we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers. While we have been successful to date in acquiring large enterprise customers, if we are unsuccessful in gaining additional large enterprise customers in the future or in securing subscription renewals from existing enterprise customers, it will adversely affect our future revenue. In addition, while our subscription agreements generally provide for renewals at prices that are the same as those in effect during the initial term or at then current list prices, there can be no assurance that customers will renew their subscription agreements at the end of the initial or any renewal term or that customers will not seek to condition any renewal on reduced prices. Any failure to obtain customer renewals, or reduction in prices upon renewal, could reduce future revenues. We may not be able to continue to attract capable management personnel. Over the past three years we have built our management team during a time of significant unemployment and downturn in the technology sector. This has given us the opportunity to attract highly capable management personnel. However, our ability to retain key management personnel or hire capable new management personnel as we grow may be challenged if the technology sector rebounds and/or if companies with more generous compensation packages or greater perceived growth opportunities compete for the same personnel. We depend on our key personnel. Our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Matthew J. Szulik, our Executive Vice President-Engineering, Paul Cormier, our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin B. Thompson and our Executive Vice President--Worldwide Sales, Alex Pinchev. The loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any of these individuals could seriously impede our success. Moreover, the loss of one or a group of our key employees, particularly to a competitor, and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the Red Hat brand. We may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively with Unix operating systems providers, Microsoft, other established operating systems developers, software development tools developers, and certain infrastructure service providers. In the market for operating systems, we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have. These competitors, which offer hardware-independent multi-user operating systems for Intel platforms and/or UNIX-based operating systems, include Microsoft, Novell, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Unisys. In the future, these competitors may develop and market a competing open source operating system. As we increase our services offerings, we may face competition from larger companies that currently provide service and training related to the Linux operating system as well as other operating systems, particularly UNIX-based operating systems, due to the fact that Linux-and UNIX-based operating systems share many common features. These companies, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard, may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of consulting and training on a more cost-effective basis than we can. We may not be able to compete successfully with current or potential competitors. We may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations continue to expand. As we expand our international operations, we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas. For example: o we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally-dispersed business; o fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results; o we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws;
o we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights; o export controls and times of crisis could prevent us from shipping our products into and out of certain markets; o changes in import/export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries; and o economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets. Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTY We could be prevented from selling or developing our software if the GNU General Public License and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable. The Linux kernel and the Red Hat Linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the GNU General Public License and similar open source licenses. These licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied, modified and distributed. The GNU General Public license is a subject of litigation in the case of The SCO Group, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., pending in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. It is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them. Any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable, or that Linux-based operating systems, or significant portions of them, may not be liberally copied, modified or distributed, would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our products. Our subscription-based contract model may encounter customer resistance. The subscription agreement for Red Hat Enterprise Linux requires customers to agree to a subscription for our systems management services for each machine on which they deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux. At the same time, the subscription agreement places no restriction on the customer's right to redistribute Red Hat Enterprise Linux. While we believe this practice fully complies with the requirements of the GNU General Public License, and while we have reviewed this practice with the Free Software Foundation, the organization that maintains and provides interpretations of the GNU General Public license, we may still encounter customer resistance to this distribution model. To the extent we are unsuccessful in promoting or defending this distribution model, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We have agreed to protect our customers if our products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights. We have committed to all of our customers with valid, registered Red Hat Enterprise subscriptions that if any portion of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux product is found to infringe any third party intellectual property rights we will, at our expense and option: (i) obtain the right for the customer to continue to use the product consistent with their subscription agreement with us; (ii) modify the product so that it is non-infringing; or (iii) replace the infringing component with a non-infringing component. Although we cannot predict whether we will need to satisfy this commitment, and although our subscription agreements typically state that our liability thereunder shall not exceed the amount a customer paid to us during the previous 12 months, satisfying the commitment could be costly and time consuming and could materially and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, our insurance policies may not adequately cover our exposure to this type of claim. We are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of distinct software components, many of which are developed by numerous independent parties, and an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business. We are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of distinct software components, many of which are developed by numerous independent parties. Claims for infringement of intellectual property rights may be filed and may seek damages and injunctive relief. In particular, third parties may assert claims for infringement or claims based on trade secret theories. The risk of infringement claims is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control. It is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications. Claims of infringement could require us to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, reengineer our products, or discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis.
SCO Group, Inc., or SCO, has publicly alleged that certain Linux kernels contain unauthorized UNIX code or derivative works. On August 4, 2003, we filed a complaint against SCO in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that we are not infringing any of SCO's intellectual property rights. SCO moved to dismiss the complaint and, to date, has not asserted a claim of infringement against us. Uncertainty concerning SCO's allegations, regardless of their merit, could adversely affect sales of our products. If SCO were to prevail in this or other actions related to their claims regarding Linux, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Defending patent infringement, copyright infringement and/or trade secret claims, even claims without significant merit, can be expensive. An adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business. Our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct, delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation. Despite testing by ourselves and our customers, errors have been and may continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control. If errors are discovered, we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all. Errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of Linux-based operating systems and other open source software products. In addition, failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us. Although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims, it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. In addition, our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim. These claims, even if unsuccessful, could be costly and time consuming to defend. Our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights. Our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks. The protective steps we have taken in the past have been, and may in the future continue to be, inadequate to deter misappropriation of our trademark rights. Although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our trademark rights in a timely manner. We have registered some of our trademarks in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia and have other trademark applications pending in each of those regions. Effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services. Failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the Red Hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively. Furthermore, defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.

Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Previews Key First Quarter Results in Advance of Earnings Call on Thursday; Company Previews Earnings and Subscription Volumes RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 15, 2004--Red Hat, Inc.

Full GAAP operating income for the first quarter will be in the range of $4.7 million. Excluding stock-based compensation of approximately $1.6 million, operating income for the first quarter will be in the range of $6.3 million, or approximately 15% of revenues.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.
 
On July 13, 2004, Red Hat, Inc. issued a press release announcing its intention to restate its audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2004, February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, and its unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2004. The full text of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
PRO FORMA
FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
Red Hat Announces Plan to Change Method of Revenue Recognition for Subscription Agreements and to Restate Financial Statements to Reflect Change
 
RALEIGH, NCJuly 13, 2004  Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ: RHAT) today announced that it has corrected the manner in which it recognizes revenues for certain of its subscription agreements and, as a result, will restate its audited financial statements for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2004, February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, and its unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2004.
 
The decision results from recent discussions between the Company and the Company's independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, following the normal rotation of audit partners required by the accounting profession's rotation rules. As a result of these discussions, the Company determined it would be appropriate to stop recognizing revenue for subscription agreements on a monthly basis - a method it has consistently applied for the last five years - and start recognizing revenue on a daily basis over the particular contract term.
 
The restatement is due entirely to the correction in the Company's method of recognizing revenue for subscription agreements. The effect of using the new method is to defer a portion of the revenue that had been previously recognized in the month of commencement of a subscription to the month in which the subscription ends.
 
This correction in method has no effect on the amount of revenues that the Company will ultimately recognize from the subscriptions to the Company's Red Hat Enterprise Linux product that the Company has sold over the last 24 months, nor does it affect the sequential quarterly growth in the number of subscriptions sold over the last two fiscal years or the increase in operating cash flows that has resulted from the increase in the number of new subscriptions sold over this period.
 
While the new accounting method is not expected to materially affect annual revenues and will not affect operating cash flows or the number of new subscriptions for any quarterly period, it is expected to result in significant percentage differences in certain items such as quarterly operating profit and net income. Attached is a summary of the estimated range of effects of the accounting change on the Company's annual and quarterly historical results.
 
"The restatement is not expected to reflect any material difference in the meaningful historical trends of our business, nor will it adversely affect our business outlook, which remains strong," said Matthew Szulik, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Red Hat. "We remain committed to meeting high standards in providing timely, accurate and transparent financial reporting, and our planned restatement reflects this commitment. The restatement will also assure that future comparisons to past periods are made on a consistent basis."
 
The Company recognized revenues, prior to the correction, using a method that resulted in revenue recognition as if the subscription commenced on the first day of the month in which the subscription was sold. For example, the Company would have recognized one-twelfth of the revenue of a twelve-month subscription in the calendar month during which the subscription commenced, and the remaining subscription revenue over the next eleven calendar months.
On June 16, 2004, the Company's independent auditors informed the Company that it should consider recognizing revenue from a subscription over the term of the subscription (for example, the number of days in the subscription period), which ultimately resulted in the Company deciding to change to this method. The resulting change in method will now mean that the Company will begin to recognize revenue on the date of commencement of a subscription and ratably over the remaining term of the subscription. The effect of the Company's decision is to defer a portion of the subscription revenues that would have been recognized in the month of the commencement of the subscription to the last month of the subscription term.
 
Red Hat is currently not aware of any other adjustments that will be required to its historical financial statements in addition to those reflected in the estimates in the attached summary. It is possible, however, that other items may be identified in the process of restating the Company's financial statements. In addition, the Company is in the process of responding to prior comments and questions from the SEC regarding its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the Company does not anticipate that the review by the Staff will result in any material changes to previously reported financial results, the Company cannot provide assurances that such changes will not be required.
 
The Company will be filing a Form 12b-25 extending the deadline for the filing of its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2004, and currently anticipates filing its Form 10-Q for that fiscal quarter on or before July 19, 2004. As soon as practicable, the Company will amend its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004.

Any involuntary termination shall be considered a result of a Change of Control if (a) it occurs within twelve months of the transaction resulting in the Change of Control and (b) it is not for cause.

The notice of exercise, accompanied by such payment, shall be delivered to the Company at its principal business office or such other office as the Committee may from time to time direct, and shall be in such form, containing such further provisions consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee may from time to time prescribe. In no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance. Except under certain circumstances contemplated by Section 11 or as may be set forth in an Award Agreement with respect to death or disability of a Participant, Options will not be exercisable before the expiration of one year from the date the Option is granted.
5.5.
Exercise of Options
 
.    In its sole discretion, the Committee may provide, at the time of grant, that the Shares to be issued upon an Option's exercise shall be in the form of Restricted Stock or other similar securities, or may reserve the right so to provide after the time of grant.
5.6.
Form of Settlement
 
6. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
.    The Committee may provide Stock Appreciation Rights alone or in tandem with other Awards (including Options), in each case upon such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee may establish. The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
6.1.
Grant and Exercise
 
(a) Stock Appreciation Rights granted without regard to any Option or other Award (a "Freestanding Stock Appreciation Right") shall generally have the same terms and conditions as Options, including (i) an exercise price not less than Fair Market Value on the date of grant (except in the case of Substitute Awards or in connection with an adjustment provided in Section 12.2) (ii) a term not greater than ten years, and (iii) a vesting schedule not less than one year from the date of grant, except under certain circumstances contemplated by Section 11 or as may be set forth in an Award Agreement with respect to death or disability
 
of a Participant. Upon the exercise of a Freestanding Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right on the date of grant.
 
(b) Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any Option granted under the Plan (a "Tandem Stock Appreciation Right"). Any Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be granted at the same time as the related Option is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration of such Option. Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the related Option exercise price. Any Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only when the related Option would be exercisable and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the related Option exceeds the option price at which Shares can be acquired pursuant to the Option. Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon and to the extent of the termination or exercise of the related Option; provided that, unless the Committee otherwise determines at or after the time of grant, a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to less than the full number of Shares covered by a related Option shall not terminate until the number of Shares then exercisable under such Option equals the number of Shares to which the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right applies. Any Option related to a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall no longer be exercisable to the extent the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised.
 
(c) The Committee may impose such terms and conditions on Stock Appreciation Rights granted in conjunction with any Award (other than an Option) as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
(d) The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether payment upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, shall be made in cash, in whole Shares or other property, or any combination thereof. If payment will be made in Shares, the number of Shares shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise. If the Committee elects to make full payment in Shares, no fractional Shares shall be issued and cash payments shall be made in lieu of fractional Shares. The Committee shall have sole discretion as to the timing of any payment made in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, upon exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights. Payment may be made in a lump sum, in annual installments or may be otherwise deferred; and the Committee shall have sole discretion to determine whether any deferred payments may bear amounts equivalent to interest or cash dividends.
 
(e) Other than pursuant to Section 12.2, the Committee shall not be permitted to (i) lower the exercise price per Share of a Stock Appreciation Right after it is granted, (ii) cancel a Stock Appreciation Right when the exercise price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for another Award (other than in connection with Substitute Awards), and (iii) take any other action with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right that may be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, without shareholder approval.
 
7. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS
 
.    Awards of Restricted Stock and of Restricted Stock Units may be granted hereunder to Participants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan (a "Restricted Stock Award" or "Restricted Stock Unit Award", respectively). A Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to restrictions imposed by the Committee covering a period of time specified by the Committee (the "Restriction Period"). The provisions of Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. The Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether any consideration (other than services) is to be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the issuance of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
7.1.
Grants
 
.    The terms of any Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award granted under the Plan shall be set forth in a written Award Agreement which shall contain provisions determined by the Committee and not inconsistent with the Plan.
7.2.
Award Agreements
 
    Beginning on the date of grant of the Restricted Stock Award and subject to execution of the Award Agreement, the Participant shall become a shareholder of the Company with respect to all Shares subject to the Award Agreement and shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote such Shares and the right to receive distributions made with respect to such Shares. A Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not possess voting rights with respect to such Award. Any Shares or any other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend, Dividend Equivalent or otherwise with respect to any Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award as to which the restrictions have not yet lapsed shall be subject to the same restrictions as such Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award.
7.3.
Rights of Holders of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.
 
    Except in limited situations as determined by the Committee (including termination of employment, a Change in Control referred to in Section 11, grants to new hires to replace forfeited compensation, grants representing payment of earned Performance Awards or other incentive compensation, or grants to Directors), Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards subject solely to future service requirements shall have a Restriction Period of not less than three years from date of grant (but permitting pro-rata vesting over such time).

8. OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS
 
.    Other Awards of Shares and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, Shares or other property ("Other Stock-Based Awards") may be granted hereunder to Participants, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan, and such Other Stock-Based Awards shall also be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan. Other Stock-Based Awards shall be paid only in Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees and Directors to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be made, the number of Shares to be granted pursuant to such Awards, and all other conditions of the Awards. The provisions of Other Stock-Based Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Except for certain limited situations (including termination of employment, a Change in Control referred to in Section 11, grants to new hires to replace forfeited compensation, grants representing payment of earned Performance Awards or other incentive compensation, or grants to Directors), Other Stock-Based Awards subject solely to future service requirements shall have a Restriction Period of not less than three years from date of grant (but permitting pro-rata vesting over such time).

Stock and Administration
 
.    Shares (including securities convertible into Shares) subject to Awards granted under this Section 8 may be issued for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law.

8.2.
Terms and Conditions
 
9. PERFORMANCE AWARDS
 
.    Performance Awards may be issued hereunder to Participants, for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan. The performance criteria to be achieved during any Performance Period and the length of the Performance Period shall be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award; provided, however, that a Performance Period shall not be shorter than 12 months nor longer than five years. Except as provided in Section 11 or as may be provided in an Award Agreement, Performance Awards will be distributed only after the end of the relevant Performance Period. Performance Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole
9.1.
Terms of Performance Awards
 
discretion of the Committee at the time of payment. The performance goals to be achieved for each Performance Period shall be conclusively determined by the Committee and may be based upon the criteria set forth in Section 10.1. The amount of the Award to be distributed shall be conclusively determined by the Committee. Performance Awards may be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the Performance Period or, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, on a deferred basis.
 
10. CODE SECTION 162(m) PROVISIONS
 
.    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if the Committee determines at the time a Restricted Stock Award, a Restricted Stock Unit Award, a Performance Award or an Other Stock-Based Award is granted to a Participant who is, or is likely to be, as of the end of the tax year in which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee, then the Committee may provide that this Section 10.1 is applicable to the Award and that the lapsing of restrictions thereon and the distribution of cash, Shares or other property pursuant thereto, as applicable, shall accordingly be subject to the achievement of one or more objective performance goals established by the Committee, which shall be based on the attainment of specified levels of one or any combination of the following: revenue growth; earnings before taxes; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; operating income; pre- or after-tax income; cash flow; cash flow per share; net earnings; earnings per share; return on equity; return on invested capital; return on assets; economic value added (or an equivalent metric); share price performance; total shareholder return; improvement in or attainment of expense levels; improvement in or attainment of working capital levels; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; market share; gross profits; and/or comparisons with various stock market indices of the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the Participant is primarily employed. Such performance goals also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of an Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company, or based upon the relative performance of other companies or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies. The Committee may also exclude the impact of an event or occurrence which the Committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including (a) restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges, (b) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable control of the Company's management, or (c) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles. Such performance goals shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of, Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.
10.1.
Covered Employees and Performance Criteria
 
.    Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan (other than Sections 11 and 12.2), with respect to any Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, Performance Award or Other Stock-Based Award that is subject to this Section 10, the Committee may adjust downwards, but not upwards, the amount payable pursuant to such Award, and the Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable performance goals, except in the case of the death or disability of the Participant.
10.2.
Adjustments
 
.    The Committee shall have the power to impose such other restrictions on Awards subject to this Section 10 as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto.
10.3.
Restrictions
 
    Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12.2, no Participant may be granted (i) Options, Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights, or Option/Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights during any 12-month period with respect to more than two million (2,000,000) Shares or (ii) Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance Awards and/or Other Stock-Based Awards that are denominated in Shares in any 12-month period with respect to more than one million (1,000,000) Shares (the "Limitations"). In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value payable to any Participant in any 12-month period with respect to Performance Awards that are valued with reference to property other than Shares is $10,000,000. If an Award is cancelled, the cancelled Award shall continue to be counted toward the
10.4.
Limitations on Grants to Individual Participant.
 
applicable Limitations. The per-Participant limit described in this Section 10.4 shall be construed and applied consistently with Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.
 
11. CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS
 
.    The terms of any Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award that, upon a "Change in Control" of the Company (as that term may be defined therein), (a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control shall become exercisable in full or part (b) restrictions and deferral limitations on Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards lapse and the Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards become free of all restrictions and limitations and become vested, and (c) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Stock-Based Awards or any other Awards shall lapse, and such Other Stock-Based Awards or such other Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested in full or part and transferable to the full extent of the original grant, subject in each case to any terms and conditions contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award, including but not limited to a condition that such treatment will apply only if the Participant remains employed on the effective date of the Change in Control or has incurred an involuntary termination of employment without cause on account of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, within a period of up to 3 months prior to the effective date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, each Option and Stock Appreciation Right outstanding shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the Participant, and such Participant shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such Share immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control over the exercise price per share of such Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including the stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine.
11.1.
Impact of Change in Control on Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards
 
.    In the event of a Change in Control, the successor company may assume or substitute for an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award. For the purposes of this Section 11.2, an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award shall be considered assumed or substituted for if following the Change in Control the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the transaction constituting a Change in Control by holders of Shares for each Share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the transaction constituting a Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor company, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award, for each Share subject thereto, will be solely common stock of the successor company substantially equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in the transaction constituting a Change in Control. The determination of such substantial equality of value of consideration shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and its determination shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in an Award Agreement, in the event of an involuntary termination of a Participant's employment without cause in such successor company within the period of up to 24 months following such Change in Control, each Award held by such Participant at the time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1 above.
11.2.
Assumption of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards Upon Change in Control
 
    The terms of any Performance Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Performance Award that, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as that term may be defined therein),
11.3.
Impact of Change in Control on Performance Awards.
 
(a) a pro rata portion of Performance Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable based on the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the date of the Change in Control and based on performance to such date, or if performance to such date is not determinable, based on target performance, and
 
(b) the remaining portion of Performance Awards shall be assumed, converted or replaced with restricted stock in the successor company's shares (if Performance Shares) or restricted deferred compensation (if Performance Units) based on the portion of the Performance Period not yet completed and based on target performance. Such assumed, converted or replaced portion of the Performance Award shall be restricted for the remainder of the Performance Period or vesting period, as applicable. If the successor company does not assume, convert or replace the remaining portion of the Performance Award as described in this Section 11.3(b), the full award shall be considered earned and payable upon consummation of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Award Agreement for a Performance Award may provide that in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's employment with the Company or any Affiliate without cause on account of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, within a period of up to 3 months prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and/or in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's employment without cause in such successor company within the period of up to 24 months following such Change in Control, the vesting of the restricted stock or restricted deferred compensation, as applicable, held by such Participant at the time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated.
 
12. GENERALLY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS
 
.    The Board may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for shareholder approval imposed by applicable law, including the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or any rule or regulation of any stock exchange or quotation system on which Shares are listed or quoted; provided that the Board may not amend the Plan in any manner that would result in noncompliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; and further provided that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, amend the Plan to (a) increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 12.2), (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) amend any provision of Section 5.3, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any Option specified by Section 5.4, or (f) amend any provision of Section 10.4. In addition, no amendments to, or termination of, the Plan shall in any way materially impair the rights of a Participant under any Award previously granted without such Participant's consent.
12.1.
Amendment and Modification of the Plan
 
.    In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution (whether in cash, shares or other property), stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar transaction or other change in corporate structure affecting the Shares or the value thereof, such adjustments and other substitutions shall be made to the Plan and to Awards as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equitable or appropriate, including such adjustments in the aggregate number, class and kind of securities that may be delivered under the Plan and, in the aggregate or to any one Participant, in the number, class, kind and option or exercise price of securities subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan (including, if the Committee deems appropriate, the substitution of similar options to purchase the shares of, or other awards denominated in the shares of, another company) as the Committee may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.
12.2.
Adjustments
 
.    Except as provided below, and except as otherwise authorized by the Committee in an Award Agreement, no Award and no Shares subject to Awards described in Section 8 that have
12.3.
Transferability of Awards
 
not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and such Award may be exercised during the life of the Participant only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its discretion, permit the transfer of an Award to an individual or entity other than the Company (each transferee thereof, a "Permitted Assignee").
 
.    The Committee shall determine and set forth in each Award Agreement whether any Awards granted in such Award Agreement will continue to be exercisable, and the terms of such exercise, on and after the date that a Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Company or any Affiliate (including as a Director), whether by reason of death, disability, voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or services, or otherwise. The date of termination of a Participant's employment or services will be determined by the Committee, which determination will be final.
12.4.
Termination of Employment
 
; .    The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures pursuant to which the payment of any Award may be deferred. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award (including any deferred Award) may, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to cash, stock or other property dividends on Shares ("Dividend Equivalents") with respect to the number of Shares covered by the Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested.
12.5.
Deferral
Dividend Equivalents
 
13. MISCELLANEOUS
 
.    The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant (or a Permitted Assignee thereof) (any such person, a "Payee") net of any applicable Federal, State and local taxes required to be paid or withheld as a result of (a) the grant of any Award, (b) the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (c) the delivery of Shares or cash, (d) the lapse of any restrictions in connection with any Award or (e) any other event occurring pursuant to the Plan. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such Payee such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Payee to pay such withholding taxes. If the Payee shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Payee or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligation for the payment of such taxes by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), or by directing the Company to retain Shares (up to the employee's minimum required tax withholding rate) otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award.
13.1.
Tax Withholding
 
.    Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any Employee or Director the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate the employment or service of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any such Employee or Director at any time for any reason. Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of termination of an employment or other relationship. No Employee or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan.
13.2.
Right of Discharge Reserved; Claims to Awards
 
.    The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall not, with respect to such Award, be deemed to have become a Participant, or to have any rights with respect to such Award, until
13.3.
Prospective Recipient
 
and unless such recipient shall have executed an agreement or other instrument evidencing the Award and delivered a copy thereof to the Company, and otherwise complied with the then applicable terms and conditions.
 
.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all outstanding Awards granted to any Participant shall be canceled if the Participant, without the consent of the Company, while employed by the Company or any Affiliate or after termination of such employment or service, establishes a relationship with a competitor of the Company.
13.4.
Cancellation of Award
 
.    All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under the Plan or make any other distributions or the benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
13.5.
Stop Transfer Orders
 
.    All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or any Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
13.6.
Nature of Payments
 
.    Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
13.7.
Other Plans
 
.    If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
13.8.
Severability
 
.    All references in the Plan to "" are intended to refer to the Section or Sections, as the case may be, of the Plan. As used in the Plan, the words "" and "," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "."

without limitation
 
    The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver the Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, however, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.
13.10.
Unfunded Status of the Plan.
 
.    The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware and construed accordingly.
13.11.
Governing Law
 
.    The Plan shall be effective on the date of the approval of the Plan by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at a duly constituted meeting of the shareholders of the Company. The Plan shall be null and void and of no effect if the foregoing condition is not fulfilled and in such event each Award shall, notwithstanding any of the preceding provisions of the Plan, be null and void and of no effect. Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time to time on or prior to the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan, on which date the Plan will expire except as to Awards then outstanding under the Plan. Such outstanding Awards shall remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired.
13.12.
Effective Date of Plan; Termination of Plan
 
.

RALEIGH, NC, Sept. 30 2004 - Red Hat, Inc. (Nasdaq: RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced that it has entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with America Online, Inc. to acquire certain assets of Netscape Security Solutions.
 
The products to be acquired are derived from the Netscape Enterprise Suite and include Netscape Directory Server and Netscape Certificate Management System. Red Hat plans to start marketing these products as part of its Open Source Architecture over the next 6 to 12 months. Customers will then benefit from enhanced security, manageability and office productivity as these technologies are optimized for devices and applications across the Open Source Architecture.
 
"Red Hat is committed to building a secure computing environment in the enterprise," said Paul Cormier, Executive Vice President of Engineering at Red Hat. "Directory Server and Certificate Management System will enable the integration of the desktop with a network-wide set of computing services that up until now had only been available from a small set of proprietary vendors."
 
Netscape Directory Server is an LDAP server that provides greater manageability by centralizing application settings, user profiles, group data, policies and access control information into a network-based registry. Directory Server simplifies user management by significantly reducing data redundancy. Security is also improved by enabling administrators to store policies and access control information in the directory for a single authentication source. AOL currently has directory server deployed to manage information throughout its organization.
 
Netscape Certificate Management System provides a security framework designed to authenticate the identity of users and ensure privacy of communications. Unlike passwords, certificates cannot be easily stolen thus they provide a more reliable method of verifying user identity and preventing identity theft. Customers utilizing the Certificate Management System include federal government agencies and AOL.
"We believe the acquisition of these Netscape assets has tremendous long-term strategic value for the open source industry and Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscribers," said Matthew Szulik, Chairman and CEO at Red Hat. "Directory Server and Certificate Management System have already been widely deployed in the enterprise and are mature pieces of infrastructure software. The technologies will provide a secure switchboard with certificates for all traffic in the open source architecture."
 
Red Hat's acquisition of the Netscape Security Solutions assets is expected to be completed in Red Hat's third fiscal quarter of 2004. The acquisition is subject to customary conditions to closing but is not subject to any further Board or stockholder approvals of any of the parties. For more information on the Directory Server and Certificate Management System visit or call 866-2-REDHAT.

If the facts pertaining to a Loss arise out of the claim of any third party, or if there is any claim against a third party available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, the Indemnity Obligor may, by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days following its receipt of the notice of such claim, elect to assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the employment of counsel or accountants at its cost and expense; provided, however, that the Indemnity Obligor may assume the defense or prosecution thereof only if (i) it provides evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that it will have the financial resources to defend the claim and satisfy its indemnification obligations; (ii) it obtains counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; (iii) the third party claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief; (iv) it conducts the defense of the claim actively and diligently; and (v) it keeps the Indemnified Party informed of all material developments and events relating thereto Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Obligor shall have no obligation to defend any claim of any third party alleging that any Current Customer Deliverable infringes any Intellectual Property of a third party to the extent the Plaintiff or Counterclaim-Plaintiff does not specifically allege in writing that the Current Customer Deliverables infringe such Intellectual Property (even if the Indemnity Obligor has previously elected to assume the defense of such claim, provided that if the Indemnity Obligor elects to discontinue its defense of any such claim pursuant to this sentence, the Indemnity Obligor must provide prompt notice to the Indemnified Parties of its election to discontinue the defense of such claim). The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel employed by the Indemnity Obligor in any such action and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the Indemnified Party's own expense. Whether or not the Indemnity Obligor chooses so to defend or prosecute such claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and shall attend such conferences, discovery proceedings and trials as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. The Indemnity Obligor shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be liable or obligated for any such settlement, adjustment or compromise of any such claim effected without its prior written consent.

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
Reference is made to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement by and among Netscape Communications Corporation, America Online, Inc. and Red Hat, Inc. dated as of September 29, 2004 (the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used in this letter shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agreement unless otherwise defined in this letter.
 
In connection with the Closing under the Agreement, this letter will confirm our mutual agreements and understandings regarding the following matters:
 
1. Pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Agreement, the parties agree that December 7, 2004 shall be the Closing Date. Further, the parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by December 6, 2004, each of the Deliverables to which it is a party or for which it is responsible under the Agreement to our counsel to be held in escrow pending the Closing Date except for the Carve-Out Financial Statements.
 
2. By letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") dated November 12, 2004 (the "SEC Letter"), we have been informed that the SEC will not object to presentation in our reports filed with the SEC of certain substitute financial statements in lieu of the Carve-Out Financial Statements as defined in Section 3.5 of the Agreement, which substitute financial statements consist of (i) the audited statement of net assets sold and statement of revenues and direct expenses as of and for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2003 (the "2003 Audited Financial Statements"); and (ii) the unaudited statement of net assets sold as of September 30, 2004 and statements of revenues and direct expenses for the 9-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004, all of which substitute financial statements shall include footnotes and shall otherwise be in accordance with the SEC Letter.
 
3. The parties agree that on the Closing Date Sellers shall deliver to Buyer: (i) the unaudited statement of net assets sold and statement of revenues and direct expenses as of and for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2003; and (ii) the unaudited statement of net assets sold as of September 30, 2004 and statements of revenues and direct expenses for the 9-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004, all of which financial statements shall include footnotes, except that such financial statements will not have been audited. For clarification, the financial statements described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed the "Carve-Out Financial Statements" for purposes of the Agreement.
 
4. For clarification, in lieu of the representations and warranties provided in Section 3.5(b) of the Agreement, each of you, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to us that, when delivered to us at Closing as provided in Section 8.17 of the Agreement, the Carve-Out Financial Statements will be: (i) true, correct and complete; (ii) in accordance with the books and records of Sellers; (iii) present fairly the net assets sold of the Security Solutions unit as of December 31, 2003 and as of September 30, 2004, and the revenues and direct expenses for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2003 and 9-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004; and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis ("GAAP") and the requirements of Regulation S-X, except that the Carve-Out Financial Statements will not have been audited.
 
5. Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer the 2003 Audited Financial Statements, which must be the same in all material respects in form and substance as the statements provided pursuant to paragraph 3(i) above, along with the audit opinion of Sellers' principal outside accounting firm, by the date which is 60 days following the Closing Date (the actual date of delivery being the "Delivery Date"). When delivered, the representations and warranties of each Seller contained in paragraph 4 above shall be true, correct and complete on and as of the Delivery Date as though made on and as of the Delivery Date with respect to the 2003 Audited Financial Statements to the same extent made with respect to the Carve-Out Financial Statements, except that such 2003 Audited Financial Statements will have been audited.
 
6. In order to secure the performance of the Sellers in the delivery of the 2003 Audited Financial Statements on the Delivery Date, Buyer shall hold-back from the Purchase Price due and payable at Closing (exclusive of the Escrow Amount) an amount equal to $2,050,000 (the "Hold-Back Escrow Amount"). At Closing, Buyer shall pay the Hold-Back Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds to First-Citizens Bank and Trust Company (the "Escrow Agent"), who shall hold such amount in escrow until the Delivery Date. In the event the Sellers fail to deliver or cause to be delivered the 2003 Audited Financial Statements: (x) by the date which is 45 days following the Closing Date (the "45 Day Deadline"), Sellers shall forfeit all rights in and to $1,000,000 of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount and the Escrow Agent shall distribute $1,000,000 of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount to Buyer by wire transfer within three business days following the 45 Day Deadline, and (y) by the date which is 60 days following the Closing Date (the "60 Day Deadline"), Sellers shall forfeit all rights in and to the remaining $1,050,000 of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount and the Escrow Agent shall distribute the remaining $1,050,000 of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount to Buyer by wire transfer within three business days following the 60 Day Deadline. In the event the Sellers deliver or cause to be
 
delivered the 2003 Audited Financial Statements, Sellers shall be entitled to any amount of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount not distributed to Buyer in accordance with the preceding sentence and the Escrow Agent shall pay all or such portion of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount to Sellers by wire transfer within three business days following the Delivery Date. In order to implement the provisions of this paragraph 6, the parties agree to execute and deliver an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached to the Agreement, with such reasonable and conforming changes as the parties may mutually agree, at Closing.
 
7. In order to secure the performance of the Buyer to reimburse certain fees and costs of Sellers as provided in Section 5.5 of the Agreement, Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to $250,000 (the "Reimbursement Escrow Amount") at Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds with the Escrow Agent, who shall hold such amount in escrow until the Delivery Date. Upon receipt by Buyer of itemized bills with detailed entries evidencing actual fees and costs paid by Sellers to be reimbursed as provided in Section 5.5 of the Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall distribute such portions of the Reimbursement Escrow Amount to Buyer as necessary to reimburse such fees and costs of Sellers by wire transfer within three business days following the date of receipt of such evidence of fees and costs by Buyer. Any portion of the Reimbursement Escrow Amount not distributed to Sellers pursuant to this paragraph 7 by the date which is 30 days following the 60 Day Deadline shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent in full to Buyer by wire transfer within three business days following the date which is 30 days following the 60 Day Deadline. In order to implement the provisions of this paragraph 7, the parties agree to execute and deliver an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached to the Agreement, with such reasonable and conforming changes as the parties may mutually agree, at Closing.
 
8. In lieu of the provisions of Section 8.17 of the Agreement, the parties substitute the following: "Buyer shall have received the Carve-Out Financial Statements."
 
9. For the avoidance of doubt, this letter shall be deemed a "Seller Agreement" for purposes of the Agreement, and as such shall be subject to your indemnification obligations set forth in Article XI of the Agreement; provided that Buyer's sole remedy for the failure of the Sellers to deliver the 2003 Audited Financial Statements in accordance with paragraph 5 of this letter shall be receipt of all of or a portion of the Hold-Back Escrow Amount in accordance with paragraph 6 of this letter. For clarification and subject to the proviso in the preceding sentence, the Hold-Back Escrow Amount (or any portion thereof) shall be exclusive of, and not be included in, any payments due from Sellers to Buyer Indemnitees under the indemnification provisions of the Agreement.
 
Except as expressly amended and modified herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
 
If the foregoing represents your understanding of the agreement between us in these matters, please execute this letter in the appropriate place below.

On December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved standard forms of award agreements (the "Award Agreements") to be used for future grants under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan").
 
The Board of Directors approved the following forms of Award Agreement for future grants to the Company's board of directors: (i) Director Deferred Stock Unit Agreement (Vested) ("Vested DSU"), (ii) Director Deferred Stock Unit Agreement (With Vesting) ("DSU With Vesting"), and (iii) Non-qualified Stock Option Agreement for Directors ("Director NQSO").
 
Pursuant to the Vested DSU and DSU With Vesting, recipients of an award will have the right to receive, at the Company's election, either shares of Company common stock or a cash payment on a specified date in the future or, if earlier, upon the recipient's death, disability, cessation of service with the Company or a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the extent that the award is vested. DSUs With Vesting vest over a period of years of service or earlier if there is a Change of Control (as defined in the applicable Award Agreement). Except in the event of a Change of Control, if the recipient's service to the Company ceases for any reason, the units that were not vested on the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited.
 
Pursuant to the Director NQSO, recipients of an award will receive an option to purchase a certain number of shares of Company's common stock at a specified price, which stock option will vest over a period of years or, if earlier, or upon a change of control (as defined in the Director NQSO). The specified term of the Director NQSO is five (5) years from the date of grant, however, if the recipient's service to the Company as a director ceases for any reason other than a Change of Control, any portion of the option that is not vested on the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited.
 
The Board of Directors approved the following forms of Award Agreement for future grants to executive officers: (i) Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement for Directors ("Executive NQSO"), and (ii) Restricted Stock Agreement ("RSA").
 
Pursuant to the Executive NQSO, recipients of an award will receive an option to purchase a certain number of shares of Company's common stock at a specified price, which stock option will vest over a period of years. Vesting may be accelerated if the recipient's service to the Company is terminated by the Company without "Good Cause" (as defined in the Executive NQSO) or by the Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Executive NQSO) within 12 months following a Change of Control (as defined in the Executive NQSO). The specified term of the Executive NQSO is five (5) years from the date of grant, however, if the recipient's service to the Company ceases for any reason other than a Change of Control, any portion of the option that is not vested on the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited.
 
Pursuant to the RSA, recipients of an award are granted shares of Company common stock that are subject to vesting over a specified period of years ("Restricted Stock"). Vesting may be accelerated if the recipient's service to the Company is terminated by the Company without
 
"Good Cause" (as defined in the RSA) or by the Executive for "Good Reason" (as defined in the RSA) within 12 months following a Change of Control (as defined in the RSA). Pursuant to the RSA, if the recipient's service to the Company ceases for any reason other than a Change of Control, any portion of the Restricted Stock that is not vested on the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited.
 
Additionally, in conjunction with the issuance of future equity awards under the Plan pursuant to one or more of the Award Agreements, the Company and its executive officers may enter into an agreement for the Amendment of previously granted equity awards (the "Amendment to Equity Awards"). The Amendment to Equity Awards provides that the Change in Control provision contained in the newly issued Award Agreements will replace any change of control provision that is applicable to such executive's previous equity awards.
 
The foregoing description of the Award Agreements and Amendment to Equity Awards does not purport to be a complete summary. Review the Award Agreements and Amendment to Equity Awards, copies of which are attached as exhibits to this current report on Form 8-K, in their entirety for a complete description of the terms and conditions of such agreements.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 6, 2004, the Registrant filed a Form 8-K describing its acquisition of certain assets of Netscape Security Solutions (the "NSS Unit") from Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online, Inc. (together, the "Sellers"). The Registrant hereby amends such Form 8-K to provide certain financial statements with respect to the NSS Unit and consolidated pro forma financial information with respect to the acquisition of the NSS Unit.
 
 
(a) Financial Statements of Business Acquired
 
Historically, the Sellers operated the NSS Unit as a group of departments and did not separately manage the NSS Unit's operations or maintain separate balance sheet or income statement accounts for the NSS Unit. In addition, Sellers never prepared stand-alone financial statements for the NSS Unit, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), since it did not have a separate legal status or existence. As a result of these and other factors, financial statements for the NSS Unit, in accordance with GAAP, are not readily available and impracticable to provide. Accordingly, permission was sought from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in lieu of providing full GAAP financial statements for the business acquired, to provide the following financial statements: An audited statement of net assets sold as of December 31, 2003, unaudited statement of net assets sold as of September 30, 2004, audited combined statements of revenues and direct expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 and unaudited combined statements of revenues and direct expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2004, and the notes related thereto.
 
The financial statements noted above of the NSS Unit are filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.
 
(b) Pro Forma Financial Information
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 30, 2004, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended February 28, 2004 and the nine months ended November 30, 2004, and the notes related thereto are filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this report.

99.2 Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 30, 2004 and Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended February 28, 2004 and the nine months ended November 30, 2004, and the notes related thereto.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Current Report on Form 8-K to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 23.1
 
 
We consent to the incorporation by reference in Registration Statements on Form S-8 (Nos. 333-112557, 333-71912, 333-59306, 333-55968, 333-45980, 333-45042, 333-37884, 333-96163 and 333-88159) and in the Registration Statements on Form S-3 (Nos. 333-12507, 333-106856, 333-113312 and 333-115389) of Red Hat, Inc. of our report dated January 11, 2005, with respect to the Combined Statement of Net Assets Sold of Netscape Security Solutions, a business unit of Netscape Communications Corporation, as of December 31, 2003 and the related Combined Statement of Revenues and Direct Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003, included in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A of Red Hat, Inc.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
We have audited the accompanying Combined Statement of Net Assets Sold of Netscape Security Solutions (NSS), a business unit of Netscape Communications Corporation, as of December 31, 2003 and the related Combined Statement of Revenues and Direct Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003. These statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Combined Statement of Net Assets Sold and the Combined Statement of Revenues and Direct Expenses are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Combined Statement of Net Assets Sold and the Combined Statement of Revenues and Direct Expenses. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Combined Statement of Net Assets Sold and the Combined Statement of Revenues and Direct Expenses. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
As described in Note 1, the statements referred to above have been prepared in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement between Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online, Inc., (collectively "Sellers") and Red Hat, Inc. ("Buyer") dated as of September 29, 2004 (the Asset Purchase Agreement) for the sale of certain assets to the Buyer, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of NSS's assets and liabilities and the result of its operations. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
In our opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets sold of NSS at December 31, 2003, and the revenues and direct expenses for the year then ended, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement described in Note 1 and Note 2, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS SOLD AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT EXPENSES
 
1. Business and Asset Purchase Agreement
 
Netscape Security Solutions ("NSS" or the "Business") is a business unit of Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape"), a wholly owned subsidiary of America Online, Inc. ("AOL"). AOL is a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc. NSS develops, markets, and supports a suite of enterprise security solutions, which consists of applications targeted primarily at the security requirements of government and large enterprises. The solutions allow users to share information, manage networks, and securely facilitate electronic commerce. NSS' technology is based on industry-standard protocols that can be deployed across a variety of operating systems, platforms, and databases and interconnected with traditional client/server applications.
 
On September 29, 2004, Red Hat, Inc. (the "Purchaser"), and AOL and Netscape entered into a definitive asset purchase and sale agreement for the Purchaser to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of NSS (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"). The assets to be acquired include Netscape Directory Server, a Light Directory Access Protocol server product that provides greater manageability by centralizing application settings, user profiles, group data, policies and access control information into a network-based registry, and Netscape Certificate Management System, a security framework designed to authenticate the identity of users and ensure privacy of communications. The Purchaser is also acquiring the NSS calendar and messaging assets.
 
2. Basis of Presentation
 
Historically, NSS operated as a group of departments within AOL's Netscape subsidiary and had no separate legal status. Furthermore, financial statements have not previously been prepared for NSS. Accordingly, the combined statements of net assets sold and the combined statements of revenues and direct expenses have been prepared pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement and derived from the historical records of AOL, including allocations of certain expenses. As a result, these statements may not be indicative of the financial position or operating results of NSS had the Business been operated as a separate, stand-alone entity. Management of AOL believes the methodologies used to allocate revenues and expenses to NSS are reasonable and represent appropriate methods of determining the revenues and expenses of NSS.
 
Combined Statements of Net Assets Sold
 
The assets and liabilities in the accompanying combined statements of net assets sold include only those assets to be sold and liabilities to be transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
Combined Statements of Revenues and Direct Expenses
 
The combined statements of revenues and direct expenses include revenues and expenses directly attributable to NSS and allocations of certain expenses attributable to the operations of NSS but incurred by AOL.
 
Directly attributable expenses of NSS include certain payroll and related expenses, consultant costs, and amortization of software development costs that are specifically identifiable with NSS. Other allocated costs are attributable to the operations of NSS, such as divisional management and finance administration costs. These costs have been allocated to NSS using reasonable methodologies, including percentage of relative revenues.
 
 
(Information as of September 30, 2004 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 is unaudited.)
NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS SOLD AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT EXPENSES
 
Indirectly attributable costs, such as business unit management, product support management, professional services management, sales and marketing management, certain consulting costs, software development engineering costs and maintenance, facilities, employee benefits and other payroll costs and information technology and support services, have been allocated to NSS using reasonable methodologies, including relative employee headcount.
 
The expenses incurred by AOL that are not specifically identifiable with NSS, but that are attributable to the operations of the Business and have been allocated to NSS using the methods described above, are reflected in the following table for the year ended December 31, 2003 and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively:
 
 
Certain other expenses and income, such as AOL corporate overhead, interest income, interest expense, and income taxes, are not included in the accompanying combined statements of revenues and direct expenses, as they are not directly associated with the operations of NSS. Corporate overhead expenses include costs incurred for administrative support such as expenses for legal, treasury, tax and executive management functions. The accompanying combined statements of net assets sold and revenues and direct expenses are not necessarily indicative of the future financial position or results of the operations of NSS due to the change in ownership, and the exclusion of certain assets, liabilities and operating expenses, as described herein.
 
Cash Flows
 
During the year ended December 31, 2003 and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, NSS' financing requirements were provided by AOL, and cash generated by NSS was transferred to AOL. As NSS has historically been managed as part of the operations of AOL and has not been operated as a stand-alone entity, it is not practical to prepare historical cash flow information regarding NSS' operating, investing, and financing cash flows. As such, the statements of cash flows were not prepared for NSS.

NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS SOLD AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT EXPENSES
 
3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Use of Estimates
 
Preparation of these combined financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the combined statements of net assets sold and the amounts of revenues and direct expenses reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Also, as discussed in Note 2, the combined statements of revenues and direct expenses include allocations and estimates that are not necessarily indicative of the revenues, costs and expenses that would have resulted if NSS had been operated as a stand-alone entity.
 
Interim Financial Information
 
The combined financial statements and related notes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003 and as of and for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004 are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all necessary adjustments for the fair presentation of statements of revenues and direct expenses and the statement of net assets sold for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
The Business derives revenues from license fees for software products and fees for services related to the software products, including maintenance and certain professional services.
 
The Business recognizes revenues in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, (SOP 97-2), as amended by SOP 98-9, which provides specific revenue recognition guidance and stipulates that the total arrangement fee from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair values of such elements. Under this guidance, the determination of the fair value of the elements is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor. In certain circumstances, revenues are allocated using the residual value method. Under this method, the revenues allocated to the delivered element are determined by subtracting the fair values of the undelivered elements, as indicated by vendor-specific objective evidence, from the total arrangement fee.
Software Revenue Recognition
 
Revenues from software arrangements are recognized by NSS only when a contract or agreement has been executed with a customer, the software and an authorization code has been delivered to the customer, the fee is fixed and determinable, and management believes collectibility of the fee is probable. Revenues attributable to software licenses in arrangements with extended payment terms are recognized when the payments from the customer become due.
 
License and maintenance revenues also consist of maintenance fees (post-contract customer support, or PCS) which are recognized ratably over the term of the PCS. NSS provides its customers with access to its technical support organization, unspecified product updates/enhancements on a when and if available basis, and general security information. The updates are considered minor enhancements to the software that are not separately marketable or considered a competitive feature or major upgrade.
 
 
(Information as of September 30, 2004 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 is unaudited.)
NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS SOLD AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT EXPENSES
 
Service revenues include other professional support services, such as training and consulting, which are available under service agreements and billed for separately. These services are generally provided under time and materials contracts and revenue is recognized as the services are performed and when accepted by the customer.
 
Cost of Licenses and Services
 
Cost of licenses and services is comprised of various internally driven allocations (see Note 2) as well as costs directly attributable to the products and services rendered. License costs are comprised of direct employee costs and an allocation of product support costs. Services and maintenance costs are comprised of employee costs and consultant costs. Amortization of software is comprised of current period amortization of acquired and capitalized software development costs.
 
Research and Development Costs
 
Research and development costs include both internally allocated (see Note 2) and external software development engineering costs incurred to develop new products or significant extensions of existing products, prior to the establishment of technological feasibility. Such costs include activities such as concept development, engineering, product design, prototype creation, commercialization, testing and packaging development work. All such costs are expensed as incurred and were $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 and were $1.1 million and $0.6 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2004, respectively.
 
Software Development Costs
 
Costs related to the development of certain software products are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, . This guidance requires capitalization to begin when technological feasibility has been established and ends when the software product is available for general release to customers. Software development costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are considered research and development costs and are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over two years.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed
 
Income Taxes
 
No provision or benefit for income taxes has been provided in the accompanying financial statements due to the fact that NSS was not operated as a stand-alone unit and no allocation of AOL's income tax provision/benefit has been made to NSS.
 
Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, no tax-related assets or liabilities will be acquired or assumed by the Purchaser and, accordingly, no tax-related assets or liabilities are reflected in the accompanying combined statements of net assets sold.
 
New Accounting Pronouncements
 
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. ("FIN") 45,
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
 
 
(Information as of September 30, 2004 and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 is unaudited.)
NOTES TO COMBINED STATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS SOLD AND COMBINED STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT EXPENSES
 
FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, relating to the guarantor's accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For guarantees that fall within the scope of FIN 45, the Interpretation requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance. The disclosure provisions of the Interpretation are effective for the financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after December 15, 2002. However, the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of a guarantor's year-end. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have an impact on the combined statements of net assets sold and revenues and direct expenses of NSS.
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.
Accounting for Contingencies
 
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, . This Statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, . SFAS No. 149 did not have an impact on the combined statements of net assets sold and revenues and direct expenses of NSS.
Amendment of Statement No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, . This statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on the combined statements of net assets sold and revenues and direct expenses of NSS.
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity
 
In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 (revised), ("FIN 46R"). FIN 46R replaces FIN 46, which was issued in January 2003. The objective of FIN 46R is to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities ("VIEs"). FIN 46R changes certain consolidation requirements by requiring a VIE, as defined, to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. For any VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January 1, 2004, the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest of the VIE initially would be measured at their carrying amounts, and any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest would be recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change. FIN 46R also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. Companies are required to apply FIN 46R to VIEs generally as of March 31, 2004 and to special-purpose entities as of December 31, 2003. FIN 46R did not have an impact on the combined statements of net assets sold and revenues and direct expenses of NSS.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 30, 2004, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended February 2004 and the nine months ended November 30, 2004 combine the historical Red Hat and Netscape Security Solutions ("the NSS Unit") balance sheets and statement of operations as if the acquisition of the NSS Unit, which occurred on December 7, 2004, had been completed on November 30, 2004 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet, and as of March 1, 2003 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations.
 
We completed the purchase of the Netscape Security Solutions unit from Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.5 million in cash. An additional $2.5 is payable by Red Hat contingent on certain future customer orders being placed on or before April 30, 2005. The assets acquired are derived from the Netscape Enterprise Suite and include Netscape Directory Server and Netscape Certificate Management System. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with Red Hat's and Netscape's historical consolidated financial statements including the notes to these statements.
 
The pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the acquisition are based on the purchase method of accounting, available financial information, and certain estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements. The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best estimates based on preliminary information. The final purchase price allocation and the actual financial position and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to various factors, including, without limitation, access to additional financial information and changes in value based on a final purchase price allocation. The valuation resulted in $14.2 million allocated to identifiable intangibles, which will be amortized over an average useful life associated with these assets of between three to five years. The pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies or cost savings that may be achievable with respect to the combined business of Red Hat and the NSS Unit nor do they reflect integration costs that may have been unforeseen at the date of purchase.
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended February 29, 2004 and as of and for the nine months ended November 30, 2004, do not purport to represent what the actual financial condition or results of operations of the combined business would have been if the acquisition of the NSS Unit had occurred on the dates indicated in these pro forma combined financial statements nor does this information purport to project our results or financial position for any future periods.
 
 
 
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 30, 2004, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended February 2004 and the nine months ended November 30, 2004 combine the historical Red Hat and Netscape Security Solutions ("the NSS Unit") balance sheets and statement of operations as if the acquisition of the NSS Unit, which occurred on December 7, 2004, had been completed on November 30, 2004 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet, and as of March 1, 2003 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations. The NSS Unit does not have the same fiscal year end as Red Hat. Therefore, we have combined their results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the nine months ended September 30, 2004 with our historical annual and interim financial statements. The balance sheet for the NSS Unit as of September 30, 2004 has been combined with Red Hat's interim balance sheet as of November 30, 2004.
 
We completed the purchase of the Netscape Security Solutions unit from Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online, Inc. for a purchase price of $20.5 million in cash. An additional $2.5 is payable by Red Hat contingent on certain future customer orders being placed on or before April 30, 2005. The assets acquired are derived from the Netscape Enterprise Suite and include Netscape Directory Server and Netscape Certificate Management System.

A number of leading industry analysts believe that Linux will continue to be the fastest growing operating system over the next 3-5 years and we remain confident in our ability to compete." Charlie Peters also stated "We were very pleased with the company's revenue and bookings performance during the quarter. Heading into fiscal 2006, we feel optimistic about our business opportunity based on the strength of the market and our competitive position, and the growing visibility of our recurring revenue model. Finally, our confidence in the future cash flow capabilities of the company is evidenced by the expansion of our share repurchase program, which was separately announced today."

Exhibit 99.2 Red Hat Announces Expansion of Stock Repurchase Program and Authorizes Debenture Repurchase Program RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 31, 2005--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the expansion of its previously announced common stock repurchase program. Under the expanded program, the Company is authorized to repurchase in aggregate up to $250 million of the Company's common stock. Based on the previously announced common stock repurchase program, Red Hat has already repurchased approximately $100 million of the expanded $250 million authorization. The Company also announced that its Board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company's 0.5% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2024. Repurchases of common stock and Convertible Debentures may be effected from time to time, either on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as appropriate and applicable. "We believe it is in the best interest of our shareholders for the Company to engage in this repurchase program. In addition, the repurchase program will help to offset dilution associated with our employee stock plans and our Convertible Debentures," said Charles Peters, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. The timing and the amount of any repurchased common stock and any Convertible Debentures will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased common stock will be available for use in connection with its stock plans and for other corporate purposes. All Convertible Debentures will be retired and canceled. The repurchase program will be funded using the Company's working capital. As of February 28, 2005, the Company had cash and investments in debt securities of approximately $929 million. Red Hat had approximately 177 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 28, 2005. About Red Hat, Inc.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On June 27, 2005 the Board of Directors of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") adopted a Senior Management Change in Control Severance Policy (the "Policy"), under which severance benefits will be provided to eligible executives of the Company in the event their employment terminates under certain conditions within one year following a Change of Control (as defined in the Policy). Under the Policy, if an executive who reports to the CEO (each, a "Covered Executive") is terminated within one year after a Change of Control by the Company other than for Good Cause, or by the Covered Executive for Good Reason, the Covered Executive would become entitled to certain benefits. The term "Good Cause" is defined as conduct involving one or more of the following: the conviction of the Covered Executive of, or plea of nolo contendere by the Covered Executive to, a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; the indictment of the Covered Executive for a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude under the federal securities laws; the willful misconduct or gross negligence by the Covered Executive resulting in material harm to the Company; fraud, embezzlement, theft or dishonesty by the Covered Executive against the Company or any subsidiary, or willful violation by the Covered Executive of a policy or procedure of the Company, resulting in any case in material harm to the Company; or the Covered Executive's material breach of any term of any agreement with the Company, including, without limitation, any violation of confidentiality and/or non-competition agreements. "Good Reason" means reduction by the Company or its successor of more than 10% in the Covered Executive's rate of annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to such Change in Control; a reduction by the Company or its successor of more than 10% of the Covered Executive's individual annual target or bonus opportunity, except under circumstances where the Company or its successor implement changes to the bonus structure of similarly situated executives, including but not limited to changes to the bonus structure designed to integrate the Company's personnel with other personnel of the surviving corporation; a significant and substantial reduction by the Company or its successor of the Covered Executive's responsibilities and authority, as compared with the Covered Executive's responsibilities and authority in effect immediately preceding the Change in Control; or any requirement of the Company that the Covered Executive be based anywhere more than fifty (50) miles from the Covered Executive's primary office location at the time of the Change in Control.
 
The severance benefits that would be provided to Covered Executives who are eligible at the time of a Change of Control include: a lump-sum severance payment equal to two times the sum of (i) the Covered Executive's current annual base salary and (ii) an amount equal to the average of the annual bonuses earned by the Covered Executive during the two previous fiscal years. In addition, the Covered Executive's participation would be continued in the Company's welfare benefits plans as in effect on the date of termination until the earlier of (1) twenty-four months following termination or (2) the date the Covered Executive becomes eligible for comparable benefits from another employer. The Covered Executive would also receive a pro rata incentive bonus under the Company's annual bonus plan. If the payments to the Covered Executives would be subject to the excise tax on "excess parachute payments" imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code or additional tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company would reimburse the Covered Executive for the amount of such excise tax (and the income and excise taxes on such reimbursement), subject to certain limitations.
 
The foregoing summary of certain material provisions of the Policy does not purport to be a complete summary. For a complete description, see the Policy, which is an Exhibit hereto.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits

Purpose
 
The purpose of this Senior Management Change in Control Severance Policy (the "Policy") is to diminish the distraction of Covered Executives (as defined below) in the event of a threatened or pending Change in Control (as defined below) and to provide financial assistance to any Covered Executive whose employment with Red Hat, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (the "Company") is terminated under certain circumstances following such a Change in Control.

(b) For purposes of this Policy, a Covered Executive shall be any employee of the Company who at the occurrence of the Change in Control (i) is a direct report to the Company's Chief Executive Officer (or, if it is so determined by the Board of Directors of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Board"), any employee of the Company at the occurrence of the Change in Control who was within the one-year period prior to the Change in Control such a direct report) and (ii) who is not covered under any individual employment agreement (other than a stock option or restricted stock agreement) that provides special cash benefits following such a Change in Control.
 
(c) For purposes of this Policy, Good Cause means conduct involving one or more of the following:

(ii) a reduction by the Company or its successor of more than 10% of the Covered Executive's individual annual target or bonus opportunity, except under circumstances where the Company or its successor implement changes to the bonus structure of similarly situated executives, including but not limited to changes to the bonus structure designed to integrate the Company's personnel with other personnel of the Surviving Corporation (as defined below);
 
(iii) a significant and substantial reduction by the Company or its successor of the Covered Executive's responsibilities and authority, as compared with the Covered Executive's responsibilities and authority in effect immediately preceding the Change in Control; or
 
(iv) any requirement of the Company that the Covered Executive be based anywhere more than fifty (50) miles from the Covered Executive's primary office location at the time of the Change in Control.
 
3.
Change in Control
 
For purposes of this Policy, a Change in Control means the occurrence of any one of the following events:
 
(a) individuals who, on the date of adoption of this Policy by the Board, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date of adoption of this Policy by the Board whose election or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Directors then on the Board (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named as a nominee for director, without written objection to such nomination) shall be an Incumbent Director; provided, however, that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the Company as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to directors or as a result of any other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies by or on behalf of any person other than the Board shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director;
 
(b) any "person" (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act and as used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes a "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities eligible to vote for the election of the Board (the "Company Voting Securities");
 
provided, however, that the event described in this paragraph (b) shall not be deemed to be a Change in Control by virtue of any of the following acquisitions: (A) by the Company or any subsidiary, (B) by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any subsidiary, (C) by any underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, (D) pursuant to a Non-Qualifying Transaction, as defined in paragraph (c), or (E) by any person of Voting Securities from the Company, if a majority of the Incumbent Board approves in advance the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 35% or more of Company Voting Securities by such person;
 
(c) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries that requires the approval of the Company's stockholders, whether for such transaction or the issuance of securities in the transaction (a "Business Combination"), unless immediately following such Business Combination: (A) more than 40% of the total voting power of (x) the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (the "Surviving Corporation"), or (y) if applicable, the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of 100% of the voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Surviving Corporation (the "Parent Corporation"), is represented by Company Voting Securities that were outstanding immediately prior to such Business Combination (or, if applicable, is represented by shares into which such Company Voting Securities were converted pursuant to such Business Combination), and such voting power among the holders thereof is in substantially the same proportion as the voting power of such Company Voting Securities among the holders thereof immediately prior to the Business Combination, (B) no person (other than any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent Corporation), is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 35% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation) and (C) at least half of the members of the board of directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation) following the consummation of the Business Combination were Incumbent Directors at the time of the Board's approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Combination (any Business Combination which satisfies all of the criteria specified in (A), (B) and (C) above shall be deemed to be a "Non-Qualifying Transaction");
 
(d) the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; or
 
(e) the occurrence of any other event that the Board determines by a duly approved resolution constitutes a Change in Control.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 35% of the Company Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Company Voting Securities by the Company which reduces the number of Company Voting Securities outstanding; provided, that if after such acquisition by the Company such person becomes the beneficial owner of additional Company Voting Securities that increases the percentage of outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by such person, a Change in Control of the Company shall then occur.
 
4.
Computation of Severance Benefit
 
If a Covered Executive's employment by the Company shall be terminated by the Company without Good Cause during the 12-month period following a Change in Control or the Covered Executive voluntarily resigns from the Company for Good Reason during the 12-month period following a Change in Control, the Company shall pay the Covered Executive a lump sum cash payment within thirty (30) days after such termination equal to two times the sum of (i) the Covered Executive's current annual base salary plus (ii) an amount equal to the average of the annual bonuses earned by the Covered Executive during the two previous fiscal years. In addition, the Company shall provide for continuation of the Covered Executive's and his or her eligible dependents' coverage under the Company's welfare benefit plans (group life insurance, and comprehensive health, major medical, dental, disability plans) as in effect on the date of termination (or, in connection with the Company's change in benefit plans applicable to employees generally, any coverage substituted for coverage in which the Covered Executive was enrolled on the date of termination) until the earlier of (a) 24 months following the Covered Executive's date of termination or (b) the date the Covered Executive or his or her eligible dependents become eligible for comparable benefits from another employer. The Covered Executive must continue to contribute the employee share of premiums, as from time to time applicable to employees of the Company generally, in order to continue such coverage. In addition, the Covered Executive shall receive a pro-rata incentive bonus (if any) to which he or she would have been entitled in accordance with the Company's annual bonus plan calculated through the Covered Executive's termination, but based on the targets achieved prior to the Covered Executive's date of termination. To the extent such targets do not lend themselves to an interim fiscal year calculation, such pro-rata payment shall be deemed to be no less than the annual target incentive payment, pro-rated for partial fiscal year employment.
 
5.
Additional Payment
 
(a) In the event that the Covered Executive shall become entitled to payments and/or benefits provided by this Policy or any other amounts in the nature of compensation (whether pursuant to the terms of this Policy or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, with any person whose actions result in a change of ownership or effective control covered by Section 280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or with any person affiliated with the Company or such person) as a result of such change in ownership or effective control (collectively the "Company Payments"), and such Company Payments will be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (and any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed by any taxing authority) the Company shall pay to the Covered Executive at the time specified in paragraph (d) below an additional amount (the "Gross-up Payment") such that the net amount retained by the Covered Executive, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Company Payments and any U.S. federal, state, and for local income or payroll tax upon the Gross-up Payment provided for by this paragraph 5(a), but before deduction for any U.S. federal, state, and local income or payroll tax on the Company Payments, shall be equal to the Company Payments.
Gross-Up Payment.
 
(b) For purposes of determining whether any of the Company Payments and Gross-up Payments (collectively the "Total Payments") will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) the Total Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "parachute payments" in excess of the "base amount" (as defined under Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless and except to the extent that, in the opinion of the Company's independent certified public accountants appointed prior to any change in ownership (as defined under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) or tax counsel selected by such accountants (the "Accountants") such Total Payments (in whole or in part) either do not constitute "parachute payments," represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the "base amount" or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, and (ii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Accountants in accordance with the principles of Section 280G of the Code.
Determination of Excise Tax Payments.
 
(c) For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-up Payment, the Covered Executive shall be deemed to pay U.S. federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of U.S. federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Covered Executive's residence for the calendar year in which the Company Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in U.S. federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes if paid in such year. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined by the Accountants to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, the Covered Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the prior Gross-up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and U.S. federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by the Covered Executive if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax or a U.S. federal, state and local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any portion of the Gross-up Payment to be refunded to the Company has been paid to any U.S. federal, state and local tax authority, repayment thereof (and related amounts) shall not be required until actual refund or credit of such portion has been made to the Covered Executive, and interest payable to the Company shall not exceed the interest received or credited to the Covered Executive by such tax authority for the period it held such portion. The Covered Executive and the Company shall mutually agree upon the course of action to be pursued (and the method of allocating the expense thereof) if the Covered Executive's claim for refund or credit is denied.
Adjustment of Gross-Up Payments.
 
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountant or the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalties payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.
 
(d) The Gross-up Payment or portion thereof provided for in paragraph (c) shall be paid not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following an event occurring which subjects the Covered Executive to the Excise Tax; provided, however, that if the amount of such Gross-up Payment or portion thereof cannot be finally determined on or before such day, the Company shall pay to the Covered Executive on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by the Accountant, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payments (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code), subject to further payments pursuant to paragraph (c), as soon as the amount thereof can reasonably be determined, but in no event later than the ninetieth (90th) day after the occurrence of the event subjecting the Covered Executive to the Excise Tax. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to the Covered Executive, payable on the fifth (5th) day after demand by the Company (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).
Payment Date.
 
(e) In the event of any controversy with the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) with regard to the Excise Tax, the Covered Executive shall permit the Company to control issues related to the Excise Tax (at its expense), provided that such issues do not potentially materially adversely affect the Covered Executive, but the Covered Executive shall control any other issues. In the event the issues are interrelated, the Covered Executive and the Company shall in good faith cooperate so as not to jeopardize resolution of either issue, but if the parties cannot agree the Covered Executive shall make the final determination with regard to the issues. In the event of any conference with any taxing authority as to the Excise Tax or associated income taxes, the Covered Executive shall permit the representative of the Company to accompany the Covered Executive, and the Covered Executive and the Covered Executive's representative shall cooperate with the Company and its representative.
IRS Controversy.
 
(f) The Company shall be responsible for all charges of the Accountant.
Accountant Charges.
 
(g) The Company and the Covered Executive shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any verbal communications, with any taxing authority regarding the Excise Tax covered by this section.
Copies of Communications.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated June 30, 2005

Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Reports Fiscal First Quarter Results RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 30, 2005--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT): -- Revenue Up 46% From Prior Year -- Record Cash Flow From Operations Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended May 31, 2005. Total revenue for the quarter was $60.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 46% and a sequential increase of 6%. Enterprise subscription revenue was $48.7 million, an increase of 63% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company reported net income of $12.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share, up from $11.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the prior quarter. The company reported $36.6 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter, a 20% increase from the prior quarter and the highest level in the company's history. After repurchasing $5.1 million of common stock and $10.0 million face value of debt during the quarter, cash and investments totaled $951.5 million at the end of May 2005. These transactions were completed in conjunction with the expanded repurchase program approved by the company's board of directors in March of this year. At quarter end, the company's total deferred revenue balance was $157.9 million, an increase of $20.6 million from the prior quarter and $70.1 million from the year ago period. "Our results for the first quarter represent a solid start to the fiscal year," stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. "We continue to experience strong customer demand. This quarter's record-level billings speak to the continued momentum we are experiencing globally for our open source solutions." "From an operational standpoint," Peters said, "the process improvements we implemented last quarter began to pay off earlier than we expected in terms of shorter cash collection cycles and improved cash flow from operations. Thus, despite some negative impact from recent movements in foreign currency, we remain confident in the long-term cash flow capabilities of the company. Our first quarter performance was a step forward in our stated goal of significantly growing our cash flow run rate over the course of the fiscal year." Other highlights from the quarter included: -- DSO improved by 7 days, from 64 days in the prior quarter to 57 days in the first quarter. -- Channel partner bookings increased to 60% of orders versus 56% last quarter and is approaching the company's previously stated long-term goal of 70%. -- The company released Red Hat Directory Server, providing the identity management market its first enterprise class open source solution. Dion Cornett, Red Hat's Vice President of Investor Relations, stated, "We are very pleased with the momentum we continue to see in our business and the open source market place. We remain committed to our customers, partners, employees and the open source community as a whole. And as this quarter's string of new records indicates, our partners and customers remain committed to Red Hat." About Red Hat, Inc.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On November 8, 2005, Red Hat entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the "Agreement") to become one of the five initial members of Open Invention Network LLC (the "LLC"), a newly formed limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 31, 2005. The LLC was formed for the purpose of protecting and promoting Linux and other related open source software. The four other initial members of the LLC are International Business Machines Corporation, Novell, Inc., Philips Electronics North America Corporation and Sony Corporation of America.
 
Within seven days of the execution of the Agreement, Red Hat is required to make an irrevocable initial cash contribution of $20 million to the LLC in exchange for its membership interest. The initial cash capital contributions of the members are expected to be used to pay the expenses of the LLC and to acquire additional patent rights. If authorized by the board of the LLC, the members, including Red Hat, are required to make subsequent capital contributions to fund patent-acquisition as well as the expenses of the LLC. Those contributions are subject to a maximum obligation for each member, which amount, for Red Hat, is not currently expected to be material to Red Hat's financial condition. Red Hat and the other members may agree to provide additional capital contributions from time to time. If new members are admitted to the LLC, such members will make, at the time of their admission, capital contributions in amounts determined by the board of the LLC. The Agreement limits the ability of members to resign from the LLC and sets out the situations in which a member can be removed. In certain events of resignation or removal, the withdrawing member will only be entitled to nominal consideration in exchange for its membership interest.
 
The LLC is a stand-alone entity that will operate independently of its members. Subject to member approval of specified matters, the LLC will be managed under the direction of its board of directors. Each member of the LLC will be entitled to appoint one director to the board and will have the ability to remove or replace such director. Each director on the board will be entitled to one vote. All actions of the board will require at least the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board. The board selects the officers of the LLC, who will have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the LLC.
 
The LLC will license its patent rights on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis to any party who enters into a licensing agreement with the LLC. In exchange for the benefits of being a member or a licensee of the LLC, each member and each licensee will grant a license to the LLC and to each other licensee with respect to all its relevant patent rights pertaining to Linux and other open source software. These grants by members and licensees to the LLC and all other members and licensees will be royalty-free.
 
The LLC will identify and, subject to board approval, acquire patent rights that are useful in protecting Linux and related software, or of potential value to the furtherance of Linux and related software. The LLC may take actions it deems appropriate to protect Linux and other open source software. The LLC may also take appropriate, good faith counter-measures within the scope of its mandate, such as declaratory judgment actions, reexamination actions, interferences or similar legal or administrative actions initiated anywhere in the world.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") and Matthew J. Szulik, Chairman, President and CEO of Red Hat (the "Optionee") are parties to a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement and a Restricted Stock Award Agreement, each dated December 17, 2003 (collectively, the "December 17, 2003 Agreements"), pursuant to which the Optionee received stock options under Red Hat's 1999 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Stock Options"). Effective December 30, 2005, Red Hat and Optionee amended the December 17, 2003 Agreements by entering into (a) an Amendment to Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement and (b) an Amendment to a Restricted Stock Award Agreement (collectively, the "Amendments").
 
The Amendments are intended to conform the December 17, 2003 Agreements to the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A") and to qualify the Stock Options for exemptions from unfavorable tax effects imposed by Section 409A. The Amendments contemplate that, in 2005, the Optionee voluntarily make irrevocable advance elections to exercise the portions of the Stock Options that were not vested on December 31, 2004 (the "Vesting Options") on a specified date in the future that is prior to the previously scheduled expiration date of the Stock Options (the "Election Date").
 
Pursuant to the Amendments, the Vesting Options must be exercised either on the Election Date or, if earlier, upon the expiration of a period of time elected by the Optionee after the Optionee's death, termination of employment or disability or a change of control of Red Hat, but not later than the previously scheduled expiration of date of the Stock Options.
 
In addition, the Amendments change the definition of "Change in Control" to conform to the definition contained in the Internal Revenue Code Service interpretations issued with respect to Section 409A and implement other technical changes in conformity with Section 409A.
 
The foregoing descriptions are qualified by the terms of the Amendments, filed herewith.

WHEREAS, the Company and the Optionee desire to amend the Agreement in certain respects; and
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Agreement is amended as set forth below, effective as of December 30, 2005, only with respect to the option shares that were not vested shares as of December 31, 2004. The Agreement shall be applied without regard to this Amendment with respect to the option shares that were vested shares as of December 31, 2004.
 
1. Section 5 is amended in its entirety to read as follows:

For purposes hereof, "disability" shall mean "permanent and total disability" as defined in Section 22(c)(3) of the Code.
(b)

(b) If the exercise date is on or after the Optionee's death in the name of the Optionee's estate, personal representative or beneficiary to whom this option has been transferred pursuant to Section 10.
 
4. A new Appendix 1 is added to read as follows:
 
 
"Change of Control" means and shall be deemed to have occurred as of the date of the first to occur of the following events:
 
(a) Any Person or Group acquires stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such Person or Group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company. However, if any Person or Group is considered to own more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same Person or Group is not considered to cause a Change of Control. An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any Person or Group as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this subsection. This paragraph (a) applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company (or issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction;
 
(b) Any Person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such Person or Group) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 35% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company. However, if any Person or Group is considered to own 35% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same Person or Group is not considered to cause a Change of Control;
 
(c) A majority of members of the Company's Board is replaced during any 12-month period by Directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Company's Board prior to the date of the appointment or election; or
 
(d) Any Person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such Person or Group) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 40% of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the assets of the Company, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without regard to any liabilities associated with such assets. However, no Change of Control shall be deemed to occur under this paragraph (d) as a result of a transfer to:
 
(i) A shareholder of the Company (immediately before the asset transfer) in exchange for or with respect to its stock;
 
(ii) An entity, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company;
 
(iii) A Person or Group that owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the total value or voting power of all the outstanding stock of the Company; or
 
(iv) An entity, at least 50% of the total value or voting power of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in clause (iii) above.
 
For these purposes, the term "Person" shall mean an individual, Company, association, joint stock company, business trust or other similar organization, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization or government or agency, instrumentality or political subdivision thereof. The term "Group" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule13d-5 of the Securities Exchange Commission, modified to the extent necessary
 
to comply with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(g)(5)(v)(B), or any successor thereto in effect at the time a determination of whether a Change of Control has occurred is being made.
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Optionee have caused this Amendment to be executed effective as of the date set forth above.

WHEREAS, the Company and the Employee desire to amend the Agreement in certain respects; and
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the Agreement is amended as set forth below, effective as of December 30, 2005, only with respect to the shares subject to the Agreement that were not vested (i.e., were restricted shares) as of December 31, 2004.

An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any Person or Group as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this subsection. This paragraph (a) applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company (or issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the transaction;
 
(b) Any Person or Group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such Person or Group) ownership of stock of the Company possessing 35% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company. However, if any Person or Group is considered to own 35% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same Person or Group is not considered to cause a Change of Control;

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 7, 2006, Red Hat Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Red Hat"), JBoss, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("JBoss"), DaVinci-Matterhorn, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Hat ("DaVinci-Matterhorn"), Matterhorn-DaVinci, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Hat ("Matterhorn-DaVinci"), and Sacha Labourey, in his capacity as the JBoss stockholders' representative, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the Merger Agreement, Red Hat will acquire JBoss through a merger of DaVinci-Matterhorn with and into JBoss (the "Merger").
The base consideration to be paid by Red Hat at the closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement for all of the outstanding equity of JBoss is approximately $350 million. In addition, Red Hat will be obligated to pay an additional approximately $70 million pursuant to the Merger Agreement during the two years after the closing upon the achievement of certain performance milestones related to the JBoss products and services. The consideration to be paid by Red Hat in connection with the Merger will consist of approximately 40% in cash and approximately 60% in shares of Red Hat common stock. The number of shares to be issued by Red Hat will be calculated based on the average closing price for such shares over a 20-trading day period preceding the closing. The amount of consideration to be paid is subject to adjustment based on the net working capital of JBoss on the closing date. Red Hat will, following the closing date, register for resale the shares issued in the Merger, subject to customary conditions.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing, $43 million of the cash consideration to be paid at the closing will be deposited into an escrow fund to secure certain indemnification obligations of the holders of capital stock, warrants and vested options of JBoss and to satisfy certain obligations of such holders to adjust the base consideration. The balance of the escrow fund in excess of any amounts held for unresolved claims will be distributed the holders of capital stock, warrants and vested options of JBoss at various times over the 18-month period after the closing.
The closing of the transaction is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals. The stockholders of JBoss approved the Merger on April 7, 2006.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information contained in Item 1.01 above with respect to the issuance by Red Hat of shares in the Merger and upon the exercise of options assumed in the Merger is incorporated herein by reference. The share consideration to be paid by Red Hat is expected to be issued in reliance on an exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, set forth in Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On June 2, 2006, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 7, 2006, among Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Red Hat"), JBoss, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("JBoss"), DaVinci-Matterhorn, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Hat ("DaVinci-Matterhorn"), Matterhorn-DaVinci, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Hat ("Matterhorn-DaVinci"), and Sacha Labourey, in his capacity as the JBoss stockholders' representative (the "Merger Agreement"), Red Hat acquired JBoss through a merger of DaVinci-Matterhorn with and into JBoss, with JBoss continuing as the surviving corporation of such merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Hat (the "Merger"). JBoss delivers, and provides support for, open source software.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing, Red Hat paid approximately $120 million in cash and issued approximately 6.7 million shares of Red Hat common stock, $.0001 par value per share ("Red Hat Common Stock"), to be distributed to the holders of JBoss capital stock and the holders of vested options and warrants to purchase JBoss capital stock. Of the total cash to be paid to the holders of JBoss capital stock and vested options and warrants, $43 million was deposited into an escrow fund to secure certain indemnification obligations of such persons and to be used to satisfy any post-closing net working capital adjustment. The balance of the escrow fund in excess of any amounts held for unresolved claims will be distributed the holders of capital stock, warrants and vested options of JBoss at various times over the 18-month period after the closing. In addition to the amounts paid at closing, Red Hat is obligated to pay to the holders of JBoss capital stock and the holders of vested options and warrants to purchase JBoss capital stock up to an additional approximately $27 million in cash and approximately 1.4 million shares of Red Hat Common Stock upon the achievement of certain performance milestones during 2006 and 2007 related to the JBoss products and services. Red Hat agreed to register for resale the shares of Red Hat Common Stock issued in the Merger, subject to customary conditions.
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Red Hat assumed JBoss' Second Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Option and Incentive Plan and all outstanding JBoss stock options that were unvested as of the effective time of the Merger. In connection with such assumption, appropriate adjustments described in the Merger Agreement were made to the number of shares of Red Hat Common Stock subject to each unvested option and the exercise price for such shares. An aggregate of approximately 0.7 million shares of Red Hat Common Stock are subject to such options.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information contained in Item 2.01 above with respect to the issuance by Red Hat of shares in the Merger and upon the exercise of options assumed in the Merger is incorporated herein by reference.

The indemnified party may participate in any such defense or settlement, but Parent shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof; , , that (x) if Parent fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend in good faith the action or proceeding within ten (10) Business Days after receiving notice from such indemnified party that the indemnified party believes it has failed to do so; or (y) if such indemnified party who is a defendant in any action or proceeding which is also brought against Parent shall have reasonably concluded, based on the advice of counsel, that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such indemnified party which are not available to Parent; or (z) if representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in any such case, the indemnified party shall have the right to assume or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with no more than one firm of counsel for all indemnified parties in each jurisdiction) and Parent shall be liable for any reasonable expenses therefor. Parent shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim, and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(m) If the indemnification provided for in Section 4.15(l) is unavailable to an indemnified party with respect to any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities referred to therein or is insufficient to hold the indemnified party harmless as contemplated therein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the indemnified party, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other factors, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
 
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. Parent and the Participating Holders agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 4.15(m) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that fails to take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. No Participating Holder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds to such Participating Holder from the sale of such Participating Holder's Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of any damages which such Participating Holder has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
(n) Parent covenants that, for so long as Parent has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it will file any reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- -------------- 99.1 Press release dated June 28, 2006

Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Reports Strong Fiscal First Quarter Operating Results RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 28, 2006--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT): -- Quarterly subscription revenue of $71.5 million up 45% from prior year -- Quarterly cash flow from operations of $52.4 million up 43% from prior year Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2007 year. Total revenue for the quarter was $84.0 million, an increase of 38% from the year ago quarter and 7% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue was $71.5 million, up 45% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. The company reported operating income of $12.6 million for the quarter, including $7.6 million of non-cash stock compensation expense related to the implementation of FAS123R. FAS123R, which requires the expensing of non-cash stock option grants and other equity awards, was not applicable in prior quarters. GAAP net income for the quarter was $13.8 million, or $0.07 per share, at an estimated annual effective GAAP tax rate of 37% of pre-tax income. However, the company continues to anticipate an actual cash tax rate of approximately 5% of pre-tax income for the foreseeable future. At quarter end, the company's total deferred revenue balance was $254.7 million, an increase of 61% on a year-over-year basis and 14% sequentially. Other highlights from the quarter included: -- Quarterly gross margin improved to 84% from 79% in the year ago period. -- Total cash and investments as of May 31, 2006 were $1.1 billion. -- On June 2, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of JBoss, Inc. -- Red Hat held its second annual partner and customer Summit in Nashville, TN. "The first fiscal quarter marks a great start to an exciting year for Red Hat," stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "In particular, we continued to deliver rapid top-line growth and market share gains. While profitability comparisons to prior periods' results are skewed as a result of the implementation of FAS123R and a higher non-cash tax rate, the company's core operations continue to improve in efficiency as evidenced by our growing cash flow. Furthermore, the actual cash that we have to invest back into the business to drive growth is not affected by the accounting treatment." Peters added, "The international expansion and acquisitions closed since our last earnings report provide for new opportunities in key international geographies such as India and South America and improve our ability to capitalize on growing open source adoption beyond the operating system. Equally important, we are confident that we have the proper team in place to execute successfully on these initiatives." About Red Hat, Inc.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 26, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved and adopted the Company's 2007 Executive Variable Compensation Plan (the "EVC Plan") and established the financial performance objectives that will be used to determine the amount of the cash bonus awards for the Company's executive officers for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2007 under the EVC Plan. On the same date, the Committee approved the base salaries of each of the Company's executive officers to be effective as of July 1, 2006. In addition, the Committee set the fiscal year 2007 target bonus amounts that may be paid to the Company's executive officers, excluding Matthew Szulik, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. The base salaries and target bonus amounts, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 10.1 hereto.
The EVC Plan
The EVC Plan is designed to reward key management employees whose efforts impact the Company's performance. Participation in the EVC Plan is subject to certain eligibility restrictions. Under the EVC Plan, performance is measured during the Company's fiscal year (the "Performance Period"). Financial performance objectives for participants are approved by the Committee. Generally, 100% of a participant's bonus award under the EVC Plan is based upon those financial performance objectives. However, subject to the discretionary approval of the Committee, up to 25% of a bonus award may be based upon individual performance objectives that may include subjective factors for individual participants.
The attainment of financial performance objectives are measured based upon actual financial results versus the financial targets established under the EVC Plan. Target bonus awards may range from 10% to 100% of each participant's base salary at the beginning or the conclusion of the Performance Period, as determined by the Committee. Actual bonus awards under the EVC Plan are expressed as a percentage of a participant's target bonus award. The maximum award under the EVC Plan is limited to 200% of a participant's target bonus award.
All awards under the EVC Plan must be approved by the Committee. The Committee may, under certain circumstances involving the occurrence of unanticipated economic or market conditions that render the established financial performance objectives unattainable, permit the payment of not more than 50% of the target bonus award for participants in its discretion. In addition, the Committee, in its discretion also may modify pre-established financial performance objectives for the Performance Period or may make a bonus payment under the EVC Plan that is higher or lower than the amount calculated on the basis of the financial and any applicable individual performance objectives of the award. Payments under the EVC Plan are subject to proration for participants not employed by the Company for the full Performance Period and participants are not eligible to receive an award under the EVC Plan if they are terminated by reason other than retirement or economic reduction in workforce.
Financial Performance Objectives
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives under the EVC Plan for each of the Company's executive officers are (a) a specified dollar amount of net revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flows from operations, and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin for the fiscal year.

JBoss, Inc. (the "Company" or "JBoss") was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January, 2004. The Company is pioneering a second generation open source business model that the Company refers to as Professional Open Source.
The JBoss business model is currently based on a suite of middleware software products produced through open source communities and JBoss employees around the world, made available without charge to users, and enhanced by the use with the JBoss Network and JBoss Professional Services.
In 2005, JBoss introduced the JBoss Enterprise Middleware System ("JEMS") and the JBoss Network in order to meet the more broad-based desires of enterprise customers. JEMS is an architecture developed via open source technologies, and designed for "plug and play" with other leading technologies to bring greater flexibility and technology choice to the end user.
The Company derives its revenue by providing free access to its software products and charging for maintenance and technical support for its users. The Company also provides professional services and training. However, the Company is still devoting extensive efforts toward product research and development and accordingly is subject to a number of risks common to rapidly growing, technology-based companies, including a limited operating history, dependence on key individuals, competition from established companies, the development of commercially viable products, the uncertainty of future profitability and the continued availability of capital resources necessary to fund product development.
The Company was acquired by Red Hat, Inc. on June 2, 2006 (Note 13).
 
The accompanying financial statements reflect the application of certain accounting policies as described below and elsewhere in these notes to financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates relate to the valuation of accounts receivables, carrying value of the Company's intangible assets, and accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97-2, ("SOP 97-2"), as amended by Statement of Position No. 98-9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. The Company establishes persuasive evidence of an arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on either a signed contract with the end customer or, in the case of individual training seats, through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of the Company's training agreement terms.
Software Revenue Recognition
Modification of SOP 97-2,
Subscription Revenue
Subscription revenue is comprised of direct and indirect sales of JBoss support offerings for the JBoss suite of software products. Support offerings include maintenance and technical support for users. Accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement for the purchase of a subscription, the subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed. The deferred revenue amount is recognized ratably over the life of the subscription. JBoss subscriptions are generally offered from one- to three-year base subscription periods; the majority of the Company's subscriptions have one-year terms.
Subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements (e.g., support, training, consulting and other services). The Company allocates revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence of its fair value when the Company can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least the elements that are undelivered. The fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is established by either (i) providing the customer with the ability during the term of the support arrangement to renew at a specified rate or price or (ii) selling the services on a stand-alone basis.
Services Revenue
Services revenue includes revenues derived from the sale of consulting and training services. Consulting services consist of daily arrangements, and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Revenue for customer training is recognized on the dates the services are delivered.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments in money market type mutual funds and highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
The Company has restricted cash consisting of a certificate of deposit, supporting a letter of credit, of $108,000 at December 31, 2005 in connection with its facility lease maturing in 2010.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued expenses, approximate their fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of notes payable approximates their fair value.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 105, requires disclosure of any significant off-balance-sheet risks and credit risk concentrations. The Company has no financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions of a high credit rating which invest predominantly in US Government instruments, investment-grade corporate bonds and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks which are members of the FDIC. The Company has cash deposited outside the United States of America of approximately $900,000 to fund international operations. The concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is minimized by the Company's assessment of the creditworthiness of its customers. At December 31, 2005, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2005, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.
Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk,
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Company's existing accounts receivable balances. The Company determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience, and reviews this allowance quarterly. Past due balances over 90 days are reviewed individually for collectibility.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of net income or loss.
 
The Company accounts for operating lease incentive payments received from the lessor in accordance with SFAS No. 13, ("SFAS 13"). Under SFAS 13, leasehold improvements made by lessee that are funded by landlord incentives or allowances under an operating lease should be recorded by the lessee as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term. The Company records landlord incentives received as deferred rent incentive and amortizes those amounts as deductions to lease expense over the lease term.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment and other long-lived assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. An impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. The Company did not recognize any expense in 2005 related to impairment of long-lived assets.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Research and Development Software Development Costs
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company's products are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the product is available for general release to customers. No software development costs were capitalized during 2005, since costs incurred subsequent to establishment of technological feasibility were not material.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, and related interpretations for options granted to employees and directors. SFAS No. 123, established the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based compensation. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only requirements for options granted to employees and directors under SFAS No. 123, which requires disclosure of the pro forma effects on earnings as if SFAS No. 123 had been adopted, as well as certain other information.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2005
 
The Company recorded deferred compensation of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2005, to reflect the difference between the aggregate market value of the underlying shares of stock and the exercise price of all stock options granted with an exercise price below the fair value of the Company's common stock at the date of the grant. Deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options and restricted stock. The Company recognized $523,000 in noncash stock-based compensation expense related to amortization of deferred compensation during the year ended December 31, 2005.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes personnel costs associated with training, maintenance, professional services and amortization of technology-related intangible assets.
Advertising Costs
The Company charges the cost of advertising to expense as incurred, and includes those costs in selling and marketing expenses in the statement of operations. Such costs were immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Deferred Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of realization of these deferred tax assets. No provision for income taxes was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to the recurring losses incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency has been determined to be the functional currency for the Company's foreign operations.
Foreign exchange gains and losses, which result from the process of remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the appropriate functional currency, are included in other income in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. The translation of foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income, which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Net foreign exchange losses, included in other income, was $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Comprehensive Income
SFAS No. 130, requires a full set of general purpose financial statements to be expanded to include the reporting of "comprehensive income." Comprehensive income is comprised of two components, net income and other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the only items qualifying as other comprehensive income were unrealized gain on investments and foreign currency translation.

Depreciation expense totaled $481,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
 
Other assets are primarily identifiable finite-life intangible assets which consist primarily of purchased technologies, trademarks, and copyrights, which are amortized over their estimated useful life. Useful lives range from three to five years for purchased technologies to ten years for trademarks, copyrights and patents.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company amortized $500,000 of the intangible assets. Estimated future amortization is $1,229,000, $1,104,000, $784,000 and $113,000 for fiscal years ending December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.
 
In September 2005, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with a lender that provided an $8 million loan commitment to the Company. On September 30, 2005, the Company issued a promissory note in the amount of $4 million under the loan and security agreement. The note provided for an interest rate of prime plus 3.5%, which amounted to 10.25% at December 31, 2005.
Amounts outstanding under the loan agreements as of December 31, 2005 are due as follows:
 
The Note carries certain nonfinancial covenants including periodic financial reporting. The Company was in compliance with the nonfinancial covenants at December 31, 2005.

In connection with issuance of the Note, the Company issued warrants to purchase 160,000 shares of the Company's Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock ("Series A preferred stock") at $2.50 per share, subject to certain antidilutive adjustments. The purchase rights represented by the warrants are exercisable at the option of the holder. The warrants are convertible into shares of Series A preferred stock any time during the term of the warrants. The warrants have been valued at $178,000 using an option valuation model, assuming a weighted-average risk free rate of return of 4.07%, an expected life of three years, 75% volatility and no dividends. The Company recorded the fair value of the warrants to additional paid-in capital and the corresponding deferred financing costs in other assets. For the year ended December 31, 2005, $15,000 of the deferred financing cost was amortized as interest expense.
 
Accrued liabilities consist of the following:
 
 
In February 2004, the Company issued 9,974,533 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock ("Series A preferred stock") at a price of $1.0025532 per share for gross proceeds of $10,000,000.
The following are the rights and preferences of Series A preferred stock:
Voting
The holders of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to vote, together with the holders of common stock, on all matters submitted to stockholders for a vote. Each preferred stockholder is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which each preferred share is convertible at the time of such vote.
Dividends
The holders of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of $0.0501277 per share per annum, payable in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on common stock whether or not earned or declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends or other distributions shall be made with respect to the common stock, until all declared dividends on the Series A preferred stock have been paid. Through December 31, 2005, no dividends have been declared or paid by the Company.
Liquidation Preference
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company, the holders of the then outstanding Series A preferred stock shall receive for each share an amount equal to the sum of $1.0025532 per share of Series A preferred stock, respectively, plus any accrued dividends whether or not declared, payable in preference and priority to any payments made to the holders of the then outstanding common stock.

Conversion
Each share of preferred stock, at the option of the holder, is convertible into a number of fully paid shares of common stock as determined by dividing the respective preferred stock issue price by the conversion price in effect at the time. The initial conversion price of Series A preferred stock is $1.0025532, and is subject to adjustment in accordance with antidilution provisions contained in the Company's Articles of Incorporation. Conversion is automatic immediately upon the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering in which the public offering price equals or exceeds $3.0076596 per share (adjusted to reflect subsequent stock dividends, stock splits or recapitalization) and the aggregate proceeds raised exceed $25,000,000. At December 31, 2005, 9,974,533 shares of the Company's common stock have been reserved for conversion.
Redemption
The holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series A preferred stock may, by written request delivered after February 19, 2009, require the Company to redeem the preferred stock by paying in cash a sum equal to 100% of the original purchase price of the preferred stock plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. Payments may be made in three annual installments commencing 60 days after the Company has received the redemption request.
If the Company does not have sufficient funds legally available to redeem all shares of Series A preferred stock to be redeemed at the redemption date, then the Company shall redeem such shares ratably to the extent possible and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as sufficient funds are legally available.
 
At December 31, 2005, the Company has authorized 69,676,553 shares of which 59,702,020 shares are designated as common stock and 9,974,533 are designated as preferred stock. The preferred stock is designated as 9,974,533 shares of Series A preferred stock, all of which are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2005 (Note 7).
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to the prior rights of the holders of the Series A preferred stock.
In addition, at December 31, 2005, the Company has outstanding shares of common stock which are subject to stock restriction agreements (the "Restriction Agreements"). Pursuant to the Restriction Agreements, the Company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares of common stock in the event of termination of employment. The restrictions lapse beginning in February 2005 through February 2007. At December 31, 2005, 918,751 shares remain subject to restrictions under these agreements and are recorded in accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.

In 2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "Plan") under which 8,977,300 shares of the Company's common stock were reserved for issuance to employees, directors and consultants. In September 2005, the Company amended the Plan to reserve 10,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock for issuance. Options granted under the Plan may be incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Stock purchase rights may also be granted under the Plan. Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees. The Board of Directors determines the period over which options become exercisable; however, except in the case of options granted to officers and directors, options shall become exercisable at a rate of not less than 25% per year over four years from the date the options are granted. The exercise price of incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options shall be set at the Board's discretion.

Reconciliation between expected income taxes computed at the federal rate and the provision for income taxes is as follows at December 31, 2005:
 
The worldwide loss of $10.96 million is comprised of $8.79 million and $2.17 million federal and foreign losses from operations, respectively. The components of deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2005 are as follows:
 
The Company has federal and state NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2005 of approximately $13.6 million. The NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024. There is also a capital loss carryforward of $27,000 at December 31, 2005 that will expire in 2010.
Due to historical losses, the Company has not recorded any tax benefit provisions in its income statement since the future realization of such losses is uncertain. In 2005, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of ultimate realization. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary

differences are deductible. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and the implementation of tax planning strategies.
The Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested under APB 23. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made thereon.
 
During 2004, the Company established a defined contribution savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who meet minimum age and service requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Through December 31, 2005 there were no contributions made to the plan by the Company.
 
The Company leases its office space and certain office equipment under noncancelable operating leases. Total rent expense under these operating leases was $575,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases at December 31, 2005 are as follows:
 
Guarantor Agreements
Under the Company's by-laws, the Company must indemnify its officers and directors against all liabilities incurred or threatened by reason of serving in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these, indemnification agreements in unlimited; however, the Company has a Director and Officer insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the Company's insurance policy coverage, it believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal.

On April 7, 2006, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the Merger Agreement, the Company will be acquired by Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The base consideration to be paid by Red Hat at the closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement for all the outstanding equity of JBoss is approximately $350 million. Red Hat is also obligated to pay up to an additional $70 million pursuant to the Merger Agreement at specified times during the two years after the closing depending upon achievement of certain performance milestones related to sales of JBoss products and services during calendar years 2006 and 2007. The consideration to be paid by Red Hat in connection with the merger will consist of approximately 40% in cash and approximately 60% in shares of Red Hat common stock. The number of shares to be issued by Red Hat will be calculated based on the average closing price for such shares over a 20-trading day period preceding the closing. The amount of consideration to be paid is subject to adjustment based on the net working capital of JBoss on the closing date. The closing of the transaction is conditioned upon customary closing conditions, including the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals. The stockholders of JBoss approved the merger on April 7, 2006.
The acquisition of JBoss by Red Hat closed on June 2, 2006.

Unaudited Interim Financial Information
The unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2006 and the unaudited statements of operations and statements of cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005 have been prepared by JBoss pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for interim financial reporting. These consolidated statements are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and accruals) necessary to present fairly the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of operations, and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2006 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2006. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted in accordance with the SEC's rules and regulations for interim reporting.
Share-Based Compensation
Prior to January 1, 2006, JBoss accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of the JBoss' stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of the stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' deficit. The deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
For the three months ended March 31, 2006, share-based compensation expense is considered immaterial.
 

Exhibit 99.3
The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of February 28, 2006 and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations for the year ended February 28, 2006 combine the historical Red Hat, Inc. and JBoss, Inc. consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of operations as if Red Hat's acquisition of JBoss, which occurred on June 2, 2006, had been completed on February 28, 2006 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet and March 1, 2005 for purposes of the presentation of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been developed based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements of Red Hat contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006 and the audited consolidated financial statements of JBoss for the year ended December 31, 2005, which are included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K to which this exhibit relates. These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are prepared using the purchase method of accounting with Red Hat treated as the acquirer.
As of the date of the Current Report on Form 8-K to which this exhibit relates, Red Hat has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to arrive at the required estimates of the fair market value of the JBoss assets acquired and the JBoss liabilities assumed and the related allocations of purchase price, nor has Red Hat identified all adjustments necessary, if any, to conform JBoss's accounting policies to Red Hat's accounting policies. However, as indicated in Note (a) to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Red Hat has made certain adjustments to the December 31, 2005 historical book values of the assets and liabilities of JBoss to reflect certain preliminary estimates of the fair values necessary to prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. Any excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements once Red Hat has determined the final purchase price for JBoss and has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any necessary conforming accounting changes for JBoss. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material changes.
The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of Red Hat would have been had the JBoss merger occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include cost savings, if any, that may be realized from operating efficiencies or restructuring costs, if any, that may be incurred in connection with Red Hat's acquisition of JBoss.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Red Hat has not completed an assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities of JBoss and the related business integration plans. The table below represents a preliminary allocation of the total consideration to Red Hat's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on management's preliminary estimate of their respective fair values as of the date of the merger.
 
Upon completion of the fair value assessment, Red Hat anticipates that the ultimate purchase price and purchase price allocation may differ from the preliminary assessment outlined above. Any changes to the initial estimates of fair value of the assets and liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill.
Red Hat is also obligated to pay up to approximately $70 million at specified times during the two years after the closing upon the achievement of certain performance milestones related to sales of JBoss products and services during calendar years 2006 and 2007. Any additional payments will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
2006 Performance Compensation Plan
On June 1, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat" or the "Company") approved, subject to stockholder approval, the 2006 Performance Compensation Plan (the "Performance Plan"). On August 17, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the Performance Plan by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The summary of the Performance Plan below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Performance Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The purpose of the Performance Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders and assist the Company in attracting and retaining executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who, because of the extent of their responsibilities can make significant contributions to the Company's success by their ability, industry, loyalty and services, by providing incentives and financial rewards to such executive officers. If certain requirements are satisfied, bonuses awarded under the Performance Plan to covered employees will qualify as deductible "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Purpose.
Participants in the Performance Plan ("Participants") are the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who are chosen solely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"). The Company may also pay discretionary bonuses, or other types of compensation, outside of the Performance Plan.
Eligibility.
All awards will be paid in cash or, to the extent provided in such plan, share awards under a stockholder-approved stock plan of the Company. Payment to each Participant will be made no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year of the Company in which the applicable performance period ends. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of an award that would otherwise be delivered to a Participant under the Performance Plan.
Awards.
No Participant in the Performance Plan may be granted performance awards that are denominated in shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company ("Common Stock") in any 12-month period with respect to more than 1,000,000 shares. In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value payable to any Participant in the Performance Plan in any 12-month period with respect to performance awards that are valued in cash or property other than shares is $10,000,000.
Maximum Award.
The Performance Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall be responsible for the general administration and interpretation of the Performance Plan and for carrying out its provisions. The Compensation Committee has the authority to select persons to receive awards from among the eligible employees and set the terms and conditions of each award consistent with the terms of the Performance Plan. The Compensation Committee may establish rules and policies for administration of the Performance Plan and adopt one or more forms of agreement to evidence awards made under the Performance Plan. The Compensation Committee interprets the Performance Plan and any agreement used under the Performance Plan, and all determinations of the Compensation Committee that are not inconsistent with the Performance Plan will be final and binding on all persons.
Administration.
Under the Performance Plan, Participants will be eligible to receive awards based upon the attainment and certification of certain performance goals established by the Compensation Committee over the applicable performance period. The performance goals that may be selected by the Compensation Committee include one or more of the following: revenue growth, net revenues, gross margins, net margins, operating income, pre-tax income, after-tax income, net income, net earnings, earning per share (basic and diluted), earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, return on invested capital, return on equity, return on assets, economic value added (or an equivalent metric), cash flow from operations, cash flow per share, changes in deferred revenues, share price performance, total shareholder return, improvement in or attainment of expense levels, improvement in or attainment of working capital levels, attainment of strategic and operational initiatives, market share, gross profits, comparisons with various stock market indices, and/or implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with respect to research, development, products or projects. Performance goals may vary by Participant and award and also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of a subsidiary, division or business unit of the Company for or within which the Participant is primarily employed, or based upon the relative performance of other companies, or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies.
Determination of Awards.
The Compensation Committee may provide that attainment of a performance goal shall be measured by adjusting the evaluation of performance as follows: to eliminate the effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and other unusual or non-recurring items, as well as the cumulative effect of accounting changes, in each case as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or identified in the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussion and analysis or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate any award that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the Performance Plan.
All awards made pursuant to the Performance Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company, or a subsidiary, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to awards under the Performance Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or a subsidiary except as may be determined by the Compensation Committee or by the Board.
Nature of Payments.
Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan
On June 1, 2006 the Board approved, subject to stockholder approval, an Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Amended Plan"). On August 17, 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the Amended Plan by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The summary of the Amended Plan below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
The purpose of the Amended Plan is to allow the Company's employees, consultants, advisors and non-employee members of the Board who are selected to receive awards under the Amended Plan the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company.
Purpose.
. A total of 13,000,000 shares of Common Stock, plus any shares previously authorized and available for issuance under the Acquired Plans (as defined in the Amended Plan) and that may become available for issuance under the Acquired Plans, is reserved for issuance under the Amended Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events, including in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, or other similar change in the Common Stock or capital structure of the Company. The Amended Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Code, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards described below. Awards under the Amended Plan may be either performance-based and designed to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code, or discretionary. Subject to the Amended Plan limits, the Compensation Committee has the discretionary authority to determine the size of an award and whether it is intended to be performance-based.
Awards
. Optionees receive the right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock at a specified exercise price and subject to the terms and conditions as are specified in the option grant. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Amended Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant, and no stock option will be exercisable more than seven years after the date it is granted, except in the event of the optionee's death or disability. The Compensation Committee will determine at the time of grant when each stock option becomes exercisable, with certain minimums. Payment of the exercise price of a stock option may be in cash, Common Stock owned by the participant, withholding of shares otherwise issuable with the consent of the Compensation Committee, other consideration permitted by the Compensation Committee or by a combination of the foregoing.
Stock Options
. Restricted stock awards entitle recipients to acquire shares of Common Stock, subject to forfeiture of all or part of such shares by the recipient in the event that the conditions specified in the applicable award are not satisfied prior to the end of the applicable restriction period established in such award. Restricted stock unit awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of Common Stock to be delivered in the future subject to such terms and conditions on the delivery of the shares as the Compensation Committee may determine. Any awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units which vest on the basis of a participant's continuous active service with Red Hat or a related entity will not provide for vesting which, subject to certain exceptions, is any more rapid than one third of the award vesting after one year and the remainder of the award vesting pro rata over the following two years. Any awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units which provide for vesting upon the attainment of performance goals shall provide for a performance period of at least 12 months.
Restricted Stock
. A stock appreciation right ("SAR") is an award entitling the holder on exercise to receive, at the election of the Company, either cash or Common Stock in an amount determined in whole or in part by reference to the appreciation in the fair market value of a share of Common Stock from the date of grant until the date of exercise. SARs may be granted without regard to any option or other award under the Amended Plan or in conjunction with all or part of any option granted under the Amended Plan.
Stock Appreciation Rights
. Under the Amended Plan, the Compensation Committee has the right to grant other awards of Common Stock or awards otherwise based upon Common Stock or other property, including without limitation performance awards that may be paid in cash, Common Stock, other property or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee at the time of payment.
Other Stock-Based Awards
 
. In the event of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar event affecting the Common Stock, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, in addition to any provisions contained in the terms of a grant, adjust the number and kind of shares granted under the Amended Plan, the number and kind of shares subject to awards and the exercise price of outstanding stock options.
Adjustments
. Except as authorized by the Compensation Committee or the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, no awards and no shares of Common Stock that have not been issued or to which any applicable restriction has not lapsed may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or a qualified domestic relations order. The Compensation Committee may provide in certain types of award for transfer to or for the benefit of the participant's immediate family member, a family trust or any other entity established for the benefit of the participant or his or her immediate family member.
Transferability
. If provided in an award agreement, stock options and other awards granted to employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants under the Amended Plan may become exercisable upon the occurrence of a change in control as defined in the Amended Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, terms and conditions as may be set forth in an award agreement or determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion may supercede the Amended Plan.
Change in Control
. The Compensation Committee shall determine the period of time for which any Awards under the Amended Plan will continue to be exercisable and the terms of exercise upon termination of a participant's employment or service with the Company or its affiliate.
Termination of Employment
. The Amended Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee or such other committee appointed by the Board. The Compensation Committee will select the employees of the Company and other persons who shall receive awards, determine the number of shares covered thereby, and establish the terms, conditions and other provisions of the grants. The Compensation Committee may interpret the Amended Plan and establish, amend and rescind any rules relating to the Amended Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more directors or officers the right under an award agreement to grant, cancel or suspend awards to employees who are not directors or officers of the Company.
Administration
. The Board may at any time terminate, amend or suspend the Amended Plan as it deems advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by applicable law, including the rules and regulations of NASDAQ (or any stock exchange or quotation system on which the Company's shares are then listed or quoted). In addition, no action may be taken by the Board (except those described earlier under the heading "Adjustments") without the approval of the stockholders if the amendment would (a) increase the number of shares that may be the subject of awards under the Amended Plan, (b) expand the types of awards available under the Amended Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Amended Plan, (d) amend the provision of the Plan that prohibits re-pricing of options, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any option beyond seven years or (f) amend any provision establishing limitations on grants to individual participants.

Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
The Company or an Affiliate shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant, net of any applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid or withheld. The Company or an Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages, Awards or other amounts otherwise payable to such Participant such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Participant to pay such withholding taxes.

Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of

existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of the termination of employment of any Participant. No Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.

Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or an Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
5.5.
Nature of Payments.
 
Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
5.6.
Other Plans.
 
If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
5.7.
Severability.
 
As used in the Plan, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
5.8.
Construction.
 
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation and deferred compensation if permitted by the Committee. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
5.9.
Unfunded Status of the Plan.
 
The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to principles of conflict of laws that might result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and shall be construed accordingly.
5.10.
Governing Law.
 
. The Plan shall be effective on the date of the approval of the Plan by the holders of the then outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally and voting at a duly constituted meeting of the stockholders of the Company. The Plan shall be null and void and of no effect if the foregoing condition is not fulfilled.

Any Option shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5 and to such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable. An Option may be either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. In the absence of designation as an Incentive Stock Option, an Option will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
 
5.2. Incentive Stock Options. An Option that the Board intends to be an Incentive Stock Option shall only be granted to employees of the Company, any of the Company's present or future parent or subsidiary corporations as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, and any other entities the employees of which are eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under the Code, and shall be subject to and shall be construed consistently with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Option (or any part thereof) that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option is not an Incentive Stock Option or for any action taken by the Board or Committee.
 
5.3. Award Agreements. All Options granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall be evidenced by a written Award Agreement in such form and containing such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan. Granting of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall impose no obligation on the recipient to exercise such Option. Any individual who is granted an Option pursuant to this Section 5 may hold more than one Option granted pursuant to the Plan at the same time.
 
5.4. Option Price. Other than in connection with Substitute Awards, the option price per each Share purchasable under any Option granted pursuant to this Section 5 shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Share on the date of grant of such Option. Other than pursuant to Section 12.2, the Committee shall not be permitted to (a) lower the option price per Share of an Option after it is granted, (b) cancel an Option when the option price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for another Award (other than in connection with Substitute Awards), or (c) take any other action with respect to an Option that may be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, without shareholder approval.
 
5.5. Option Period. The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided that no Option shall, except in the event of death or disability, be exercisable after (i) with respect to Options granted prior to the Amendment Effective Date, the expiration of ten years from the date the Option is granted or (ii) with respect to Options granted on and after the Amendment Effective Date, the expiration of seven years from the date the Option is granted.
 
5.6. Minimum Vesting Period. Except with respect to Substitute Awards and grants to Directors or in other limited situations as determined by the Committee (including termination of employment, a Change in Control referred to in Section 11, grants to new hires to replace forfeited compensation, grants representing payment of earned Performance Awards or other incentive compensation), Options subject solely to future service requirements shall have a vesting period of not less than one year from date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options granted under the Plan in lieu of earned, but unpaid, cash compensation shall not be subject to this Section 5.6.
 
5.7. Exercise of Options. Vested Options granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the Participant (or by the Participant's executors, administrators, guardian or legal representative, as may be provided in an Award
 
Agreement) as to all or part of the Shares covered thereby, by the giving of written, telephonic, or electronic notice of exercise to the Company or its designated agent pursuant to rules and procedures established by the Committee for this purpose, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment of the full purchase price for the Shares being purchased. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, full payment of such purchase price shall be made at the time of exercise and shall be made (a) in cash or cash equivalents (including certified check or bank check or wire transfer of immediately available funds), (b) by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period specified by the Committee for the purposes of avoiding accounting charges against the Company's earnings, as applicable), (c) with the consent of the Committee, by delivery of other consideration (including, where permitted by law and the Committee, other Awards) having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the total purchase price, (d) with the consent of the Committee, by withholding Shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Option, (e) through any other method specified in an Award Agreement; (f) as provided by the Committee, cashless exercises as permitted under the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T, subject to applicable securities law restrictions, or (g) any combination of any of the foregoing. The notice of exercise, accompanied by such payment, shall be delivered to the Company at its principal business office or such other office as the Committee may from time to time direct, and shall be in such form, containing such further provisions consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee may from time to time prescribe. In no event may any Option granted hereunder be exercised for a fraction of a Share. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance. Except under certain circumstances contemplated by Section 11 or as may be set forth in an Award Agreement with respect to death or disability of a Participant, Options will not be exercisable before the expiration of one year from the date the Option is granted.
 
5.8. Form of Settlement. In its sole discretion, the Committee may provide, at the time of grant, that the Shares to be issued upon an Option's exercise shall be in the form of Restricted Stock or other similar securities, or may reserve the right so to provide after the time of grant.
 
6. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
6.1. Grant and Exercise. The Committee may provide Stock Appreciation Rights alone or in tandem with other Awards (including Options), in each case upon such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Committee may establish. The provisions of Stock Appreciation Rights need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
(a) Stock Appreciation Rights granted without regard to any Option or other Award (a "Freestanding Stock Appreciation Right") shall generally have the same terms and conditions as Options, including (i) an exercise price not less than Fair Market Value on the date of grant (except in the case of Substitute Awards or in connection with an adjustment provided in Section 12.2) (ii) a term not greater than seven years, and (iii) a vesting schedule not less than one year from the date of grant, except for Substitute Awards or under certain circumstances contemplated by Section 11 or as may be set forth in an Award Agreement with respect to death or disability of a Participant. Upon the exercise of a Freestanding Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the right on the date of grant.
 
(b) Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any Option granted under the Plan (a "Tandem Stock Appreciation Right"). Any Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be granted at the same time as the related Option is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration of such Option if there would be no adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code. Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, the holder shall have the right to receive (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise or such other amount as the Committee shall so determine at any time during a specified period before the date of exercise over (ii) the related Option exercise price. Any Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised only when the related
 
Option would be exercisable and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the related Option exceeds the option price at which Shares can be acquired pursuant to the Option. Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon and to the extent of the termination or exercise of the related Option; provided that, unless the Committee otherwise determines at or after the time of grant, a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to less than the full number of Shares covered by a related Option shall not terminate until the number of Shares then exercisable under such Option equals the number of Shares to which the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right applies. Any Option related to a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall no longer be exercisable to the extent the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised.
 
(c) The Committee may impose such terms and conditions on Stock Appreciation Rights granted in conjunction with any Award (other than an Option) as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
(d) The Committee shall determine in its sole discretion whether payment upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, shall be made in cash, in whole Shares or other property, or any combination thereof. If payment will be made in Shares, the number of Shares shall be determined based on the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise. If the Committee elects to make full payment in Shares, no fractional Shares shall be issued and cash payments shall be made in lieu of fractional Shares. The Committee shall have sole discretion as to the timing of any payment made in cash or Shares, or a combination thereof, upon exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights. Payment may be made in a lump sum, in annual installments or may be otherwise deferred; and the Committee shall have sole discretion to determine whether any deferred payments may bear amounts equivalent to interest or cash dividends.
 
(e) Other than pursuant to Section 12.2, the Committee shall not be permitted to (i) lower the exercise price per Share of a Stock Appreciation Right after it is granted, (ii) cancel a Stock Appreciation Right when the exercise price per Share exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for another Award (other than in connection with Substitute Awards), and (iii) take any other action with respect to a Stock Appreciation Right that may be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, without shareholder approval.
 
7. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS
 
7.1. Grants. Awards of Restricted Stock and of Restricted Stock Units may be granted hereunder to Participants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan (a "Restricted Stock Award" or "Restricted Stock Unit Award", respectively). A Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be subject to restrictions imposed by the Committee covering a period of time specified by the Committee (the "Restriction Period"). The provisions of Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. The Committee has absolute discretion to determine whether any consideration (other than services) is to be received by the Company or any Affiliate as a condition precedent to the issuance of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.

Beginning on the date of grant of the Restricted Stock Award and subject to execution of the Award Agreement, the Participant shall become a shareholder of the Company with respect to all Shares subject to the Award Agreement and shall have all of the rights of a shareholder, including the right to vote such Shares and the right to receive distributions made with respect to such Shares. A Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Unit Award shall not possess voting rights with respect to such Award. Any Shares or any other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend, Dividend Equivalent or otherwise with respect to any Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award as to which the restrictions have not yet lapsed shall be subject to the same restrictions as such Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award.
 
7.4. Minimum Vesting Period. Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards subject solely to future service requirements shall have a Restriction Period of not less than three years from date of grant (but permitting vesting of up to one-third of the Award after one year with the remainder vesting on a pro-rata basis over the remainder of the Restriction Period). Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards that are: (a) granted after the Amendment Effective Date, and (b) subject in whole or in part to performance based vesting requirements, shall have a Restriction Period of not less than one year. The Committee may, in its discretion either at the time of grant or at some later date, waive the minimum vesting periods imposed collectively by this Section 7.4 and Section 8.2 below with respect to an aggregate of 5% of the total shares authorized for issuance under this Plan in certain limited circumstances determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Substitute Awards, as well as Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted under the Plan in lieu of previously earned, but unpaid, cash compensation, shall not be subject to this Section 7.4.

8.1. Stock and Administration. Other Awards of Shares and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, Shares or other property ("Other Stock-Based Awards") may be granted hereunder to Participants, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan, and such Other Stock-Based Awards shall also be available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards granted under the Plan. Other Stock-Based Awards shall be paid only in Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees and Directors to whom and the time or times at which such Other Stock-Based Awards shall be made, the number of Shares to be granted pursuant to such Awards, and all other conditions of the Awards. The provisions of Other Stock-Based Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient.
 
8.2. Minimum Vesting Period. Other Stock-Based Awards subject solely to future service requirements shall have a Restriction Period of not less than three years from date of grant (but permitting vesting of up to one-third of the Award after one year with the remainder vesting on a pro-rata basis over the remainder of the Restriction Period). Other Stock-Based Awards that are: (a) granted after the Amendment Effective Date, and (b) subject in whole or in part to performance based vesting requirements, shall have a Restriction Period of not less than one year. Other Stock-Based Awards representing solely the right to receive shares of Common Stock at some future date specified by the Committee (the "Deferral Period") shall have a Deferral Period of not less than three years from the date of grant. The Committee may, in its discretion either at the time of grant or at some later date, waive the minimum vesting periods imposed collectively by this Section 8.2 and Section 7.4 above with respect to an aggregate of 5% of the total shares authorized for issuance under this Plan in certain limited circumstances determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Other Stock-Based Awards granted under the Plan in lieu of previously earned, but unpaid, cash compensation shall not be subject to this Section 8.2.
 
8.3. Terms and Conditions. Shares (including securities convertible into Shares) subject to Awards granted under this Section 8 may be issued for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law. Shares (including securities convertible into Shares) purchased pursuant to a purchase right awarded under this Section 8 shall be purchased for such consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
9. PERFORMANCE AWARDS
 
Terms of Performance Awards. Performance Awards may be issued hereunder to Participants, for no consideration or for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan. The performance criteria to be achieved during any performance period and the length of the performance period shall be determined by the Committee upon the grant of each Performance Award; provided, however, that a performance period shall not be shorter than 12
 
months nor longer than five years. Except as provided in Section 11 or as may be provided in an Award Agreement, Performance Awards will be distributed only after the end of the relevant performance period. Performance Awards may be paid in cash, Shares, other property, or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment. The performance goals to be achieved for each performance period shall be conclusively determined by the Committee and may be based upon the criteria set forth in Section 10. The amount of the Award to be distributed shall be conclusively determined by the Committee. Performance Awards may be paid in a lump sum or in installments following the close of the performance period or, in accordance with procedures established by the Committee, on a deferred basis. Performance Awards (other than Options, Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights or Option/Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights) designed to satisfy all requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code shall be subject to this Plan and the Company's 2006 Performance Compensation Plan (or any successor plan thereto).
 
10. CODE SECTION 162(m) PROVISIONS
 
Limits. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12.2, no Participant may be granted (i) Options, Freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights, or Option/Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights during any 12-month period with respect to more than two million (2,000,000) Shares or (ii) Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance Awards and/or Other Stock-Based Awards that are denominated in Shares in any 12-month period with respect to more than one million (1,000,000) Shares (the "Limitations"). In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value payable to any Participant in any 12-month period with respect to Performance Awards that are valued with reference to property other than Shares is $10,000,000. If an Award is cancelled, the cancelled Award shall continue to be counted toward the applicable Limitations. The per-Participant limit described in this Section 10 shall be construed and applied consistently with Section 162(m) of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, and the regulations thereunder.
 
11. CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS
 
11.1. Impact of Change in Control on Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, The terms of any Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Award that, upon a "Change in Control" of the Company (as that term may be defined therein), (a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the date of the Change in Control shall become exercisable in full or part, (b) restrictions and deferral limitations on Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards lapse and the Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards become free of all restrictions and limitations and become vested, and (c) the restrictions and deferral limitations and other conditions applicable to any Other Stock-Based Awards or any other Awards shall lapse, and such Other Stock-Based Awards or such other Awards shall become free of all restrictions, limitations or conditions and become fully vested in full or part and transferable to the full extent of the original grant, subject in each case to any terms and conditions contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award, including but not limited to a condition that such treatment will apply only if the Participant remains employed on the effective date of the Change in Control or has incurred an involuntary termination of employment without cause on account of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, within a period of up to 3 months prior to the effective date of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, each Option and Stock Appreciation Right outstanding shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the Participant, and such Participant shall receive, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such Share immediately prior to the occurrence of such Change in Control over the exercise price per share of such Option and/or Stock Appreciation Right; such amount to be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of stock or property (including the stock or property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its discretion, shall determine.
 
11.2. Assumption of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, and Other Stock-Based Awards Upon Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, the successor company may assume or substitute for an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award. For the purposes of this Section 11.2, an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award shall be considered assumed or substituted for if following the Change in Control the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash or other securities or property) received in the transaction constituting a Change in Control by holders of Shares for each Share held on the effective date of such transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the transaction constituting a Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor company, the Committee may, with the consent of the successor company, provide that the consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of an Option, Stock Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock Award, Restricted Stock Unit Award, or Other Stock-Based Award, for each Share subject thereto, will be solely common stock of the successor company substantially equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in the transaction constituting a Change in Control. The determination of such substantial equality of value of consideration shall be made by the Committee in its sole discretion and its determination shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in an Award Agreement, in the event of an involuntary termination of a Participant's employment without cause in such successor company within the period of up to 24 months following such Change in Control, each Award held by such Participant at the time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated as described in Sections 11.1 above.
 
11.3. Impact of Change in Control on Performance Awards. The terms of any Performance Award may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing the Performance Award that, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as that term may be defined therein),
 
(a) a pro rata portion of Performance Awards shall be considered to be earned and payable based on the portion of the Performance Period completed as of the date of the Change in Control and based on performance to such date, or if performance to such date is not determinable, based on target performance, and
 
(b) the remaining portion of Performance Awards shall be assumed, converted or replaced with restricted stock in the successor company's shares (if the Award is valued by reference to a designated number of Shares) or restricted deferred compensation (for other Awards) based on the portion of the performance period not yet completed and based on target performance. Such assumed, converted or replaced portion of the Performance Award shall be restricted for the remainder of the performance period or vesting period, as applicable. If the successor company does not assume, convert or replace the remaining portion of the Performance Award as described in this Section 11.3(b), the full award shall be considered earned and payable upon consummation of the Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Award Agreement for a Performance Award may provide that in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's employment with the Company or any Affiliate without cause on account of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, within a period of up to 3 months prior to the effective date of the Change in Control and/or in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's employment without cause in such successor company within the period of up to 24 months following such Change in Control, the vesting of the restricted stock or restricted deferred compensation, as applicable, held by such Participant at the time of the Change in Control shall be accelerated.
 
12. GENERALLY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS
 
12.1. Amendment and Modification of the Plan. The Board may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for shareholder approval imposed by
 
applicable law, including the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or any rule or regulation of any stock exchange or quotation system on which Shares are listed or quoted; provided that the Board may not amend the Plan in any manner that would result in noncompliance with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; and further provided that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's shareholders, amend the Plan to (a) increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Awards under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 12.2), (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) effect an amendment for which shareholder approval is required under Section 422 of the Code, (e) amend any provision of Sections 5.4, 6.1(a)(i) or 6.1(e), (f) increase the maximum permissible term of any Option specified by Section 5.5, or (g) amend any provision of Section 10. In addition, no amendments to, or termination of, the Plan shall in any way materially impair the rights of a Participant under any Award previously granted without such Participant's consent.
 
12.2. Adjustments. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution (whether in cash, shares or other property), stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off or similar transaction or other change in corporate structure affecting the Shares or the value thereof, such adjustments and other substitutions shall be made to the Plan and to Awards as the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems equitable or appropriate, including such adjustments in the aggregate number, class and kind of securities that may be delivered under the Plan and, in the aggregate or to any one Participant, in the number, class, kind and option or exercise price of securities subject to outstanding Awards granted under the Plan (including, if the Committee deems appropriate, the substitution of similar options to purchase the shares of, or other awards denominated in the shares of, another company) as the Committee may determine to be appropriate in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the number of Shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.
 
12.3. Transferability of Awards. Awards shall not, without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and voting at a duly constituted meeting of the shareholders of the Company, be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the person to whom they are granted, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, other than in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, and, during the life of the Participant, shall be exercisable only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative; provided, however, that the Committee may permit or provide in an Award, other than an Incentive Stock Option for the transfer of the Award by the Participant to or for the benefit of any immediate family member, family trust or other entity established for the benefit of the Participant and/or an immediate family member thereof if, with respect to such proposed transferee, the Company would be eligible to use a Form S-8 for the registration of the sale of the Shares subject to such Award under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to recognize any such transfer until such time as the Participant and such permitted transferee shall, as a condition to such transfer, deliver to the Company a written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Company confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Award. References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, shall include references to authorized transferees.
 
12.4. Termination of Employment. The Committee shall determine and set forth in each Award Agreement whether any Awards granted in such Award Agreement will continue to be exercisable, and the terms of such exercise, on and after the date that a Participant ceases to be employed by or to provide services to the Company or any Affiliate (including as a Director), whether by reason of death, disability, voluntary or involuntary termination of employment or services, or otherwise. The date of termination of a Participant's employment or services will be determined by the Committee, which determination will be final.
 
12.5. Deferral; Dividend Equivalents. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures pursuant to which the payment of any Award may be deferred. Subject to the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award (including any deferred Award) may, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, cash, stock or other property dividends, or cash payments in amounts equivalent to cash, stock or other property dividends on Shares ("Dividend Equivalents") with respect
 
to the number of Shares covered by the Award, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and the Committee may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested.
 
12.6. Past Performance. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may issue fully vested Awards in lieu of previously earned, but unpaid, cash compensation.
 
13. MISCELLANEOUS
 
13.1. Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant (any such person, a "Payee") net of any applicable Federal, State and local taxes required to be paid or withheld as a result of (a) the grant of any Award, (b) the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (c) the delivery of Shares or cash, (d) the lapse of any restrictions in connection with any Award or (e) any other event occurring pursuant to the Plan. The Company or any Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages or other amounts otherwise payable to such Payee such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Payee to pay such withholding taxes. If the Payee shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or its Affiliates shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Payee or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations. The Committee shall be authorized to establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligation for the payment of such taxes by tendering previously acquired Shares (either actually or by attestation, valued at their then Fair Market Value) that have been owned for a period of at least six months (or such other period to avoid accounting charges against the Company's earnings), or by directing the Company to retain Shares (up to the employee's minimum required tax withholding rate) otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award.
 
13.2. Right of Discharge Reserved; Claims to Awards. Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of an Award hereunder shall confer upon any Employee or Director the right to continue in the employment or service of the Company or any Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or any Affiliate may have to terminate the employment or service of (or to demote or to exclude from future Awards under the Plan) any such Employee or Director at any time for any reason. Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from an Award granted in the event of termination of an employment or other relationship. No Employee or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Participants under the Plan.
 
13.3. Prospective Recipient. The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall not, with respect to such Award, be deemed to have become a Participant, or to have any rights with respect to such Award, until and unless such recipient shall have executed an agreement or other instrument evidencing the Award and delivered a copy thereof to the Company, and otherwise complied with the then applicable terms and conditions.
 
13.4. Cancellation of Award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, all outstanding Awards granted to any Participant shall be canceled if the Participant, without the consent of the Company, while employed by the Company or any Affiliate or after termination of such employment or service, establishes a relationship with a competitor of the Company.
 
13.5. Stop Transfer Orders. All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed, and any applicable federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no liability to deliver any Shares under
 
the Plan or make any other distributions or the benefits under the Plan unless such delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange or similar entity.
 
13.6. Nature of Payments. All Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or any Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Awards under the Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or any Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
 
13.7. Other Plans. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
 
13.8. Severability. If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
 
13.9. Construction. All references in the Plan to "Section or Sections" are intended to refer to the Section or Sections, as the case may be, of the Plan. As used in the Plan, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
 
13.10. Unfunded Status of the Plan. The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. In its sole discretion, the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or other arrangements to meet the obligations created under the Plan to deliver the Shares or payments in lieu of or with respect to Awards hereunder; provided, however, that the existence of such trusts or other arrangements is consistent with the unfunded status of the Plan.
 
13.11. Governing Law. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the laws of the United States, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.
 
13.12. Effective Date of Plan; Termination of Plan. The Plan became effective on September 21, 2004, the date that the Plan was first approved by the shareholders of the Company. Awards may be granted under the Plan at any time and from time to time on or prior to September 21, 2014, on which date the Plan will expire except as to Awards then outstanding under the Plan. Such outstanding Awards shall remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired.
 
13.13. Foreign Employees. Awards may be granted to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Employees employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law or tax policy. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company's obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside their home country. The Committee may approve such supplements to or amendments, restatements or alternative versions of this Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes, without thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose, and the Secretary or other appropriate officer of the Company may certify any such document as having been approved and adopted in the same manner as this Plan.
 
13.14. Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. This Plan is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Award shall be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including regulations or other guidance issued with respect thereto, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Any provision of this Plan that would cause the grant of an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A of the Code shall be amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code on a timely basis, which may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance with regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee.
 
13.15. Captions. The captions in the Plan are for convenience of reference only, and are not intended to narrow, limit or affect the substance or interpretation of the provisions contained herein.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On September 26, 2006, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2006. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006 and August 31, 2005. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on: o the impact of share-based compensation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R") versus share-based compensation under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25"); and o the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of APB 25, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP share-based expense of $8.3 million and $15.9 million for the three and six months ended August 31, 2006, respectively versus non-GAAP, or what would have been reported had we continued reporting share-based compensation under the provisions of APB 25, of $0.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively. During the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $6.5 million and $14.6 million respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 37%. We currently have approximately $450 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in adjusted income tax expense for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006 of $1.2 million and $2.7 million respectively. Likewise, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $1.9 million and $3.2 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2005 was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in adjusted income tax expenses of $0.9 million and $1.6 million for those respective periods.
Management believes that the adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance. The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated September 26, 2006

Exhibit 99.1 Red Hat Reports Fiscal 2007 Second Quarter Results -- 52% revenue growth -- 6th consecutive quarter adding more than 10,000 new customers -- 18th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in total revenue RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 26, 2006--Red Hat, Inc. (NASDAQ:RHAT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions to the enterprise, today announced financial results for its fiscal 2007 second quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $99.7 million, an increase of 52% from the year-ago quarter and 19% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue was $84.9 million, up 56% year-over-year and 19% sequentially. JBoss-related revenue of $7 million was at the top of management's previously provided guidance. Net income for the quarter was $11.0 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared with $16.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the second quarter of the last fiscal year. Due to differences in the accounting treatment for taxes and stock compensation expense between fiscal 2006 and 2007, net income is not directly comparable between these periods. After adjusting for these accounting differences, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $23.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $17.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter of the last fiscal year. At quarter end, the company's total deferred revenue balance was $284.1 million, an increase of $29.4 million, or 12% when compared to the end of the last fiscal quarter. Other highlights from the quarter included: -- Quarterly gross margin improved to 84% from 82% in the year-ago period. -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux OEM revenue grew 90% year-over-year. -- Total cash and investments as of August 31, 2006 were $1.0 billion. "The second quarter was one of intense focus on integrating our recent acquisitions in Argentina, Brazil, India and, of course, JBoss," stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "We are pleased with the pace and progress of our integration work and believe that results in subsequent quarters will benefit from the investments in employee time and expense made in Q2. Revenue grew nicely and we expect the recent introduction of the Red Hat Application Stack will help continue that trend. We expect operating results and cash flow will improve in the second half of fiscal 2007 since much of the heavy integration work is behind us already." "Our better than expected revenue and earnings per share speak to the ongoing demand for open source solutions that we continue to see worldwide," stated Dion Cornett, Vice President of Investor Relations. "Moreover, the particular strength we saw in hardware OEM revenue growth stands in stark contrast to the reported weakness experienced by server suppliers this past quarter. We feel this difference highlights the value Red Hat is able to provide that extends beyond mere box counts." Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. About Red Hat, Inc.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On December 21, 2006, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2006. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006 and November 30, 2005. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a reconciliation of GAAP cash flow from operating activities to non-GAAP adjusted cash flow from operating activities based on: o the impact of share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R") versus share-based compensation expense under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25"); o the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate; and o the impact of cash flow characterization of excess tax benefits from share-based arrangements under SFAS 123R. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of APB 25, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP share-based compensation expense of $8.5 million and $24.4 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2006, respectively versus non-GAAP, or what would have been reported had we continued reporting share-based compensation expense under the provisions of APB 25, of $0.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively. During the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $8.6 million and $23.2 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 37%. We currently have approximately $411 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP
presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006 of $1.6 million and $4.3 million respectively. Likewise, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $0.7 million and $3.9 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2005 was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.2 million and $2.8 million for those respective periods. Our adoption of SFAS 123R also impacts the comparability of our current year cash flows from operating activities with our prior year cash flows from operating activities. SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award's original grant date fair value, the "excess tax benefits", be presented as a source of cash flows from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R, under the provisions of APB 25 we would have presented these excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards as a source of cash flows from operating activities. In the three and nine months ended November 30, 2006, we recognized $2.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of cash tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the share-based award's original grant date fair value. For improved year-over-year comparability purposes only, we have added these excess cash tax benefits to GAAP cash flows from operating activities resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $62.0 million and $161.2 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2006. Management believes that the adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance. The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Indemnification Agreements
On February 22, 2007, Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") entered into indemnification agreements with each member of its Board of Directors and its executive officers. The Company currently expects that it will enter into indemnification agreements in substantially the same form with any future directors and executive officers.
In general, the indemnification agreements provide that the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, indemnify the indemnitee against expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement that may be incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of threatened, pending or completed proceedings to which the indemnitee becomes subject in connection with his or her service as director or officer of the Company or in connection with other services performed by him or her at the request of the Company (such as service as a director of a subsidiary of the Company).
The indemnification agreements provide for indemnification rights regarding both third-party claims and proceedings brought by or in the right of the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by the indemnitee under certain circumstances. The indemnification agreements are not exclusive of any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which the indemnitee may be entitled, including any rights arising under the charter or bylaws of the Company, a separate agreement with the Company, or applicable law.
The foregoing summary of the indemnification agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Form of Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
(e) Amendments to Certain Agreements and Change in Control Severance Policy for Executive Officers
On February 22, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors approved revisions to (i) the form of Restricted Stock Agreement (the "RSA Form") that the Company expects to use for future grants of restricted stock to executive officers under the Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), (ii) the form of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement for Executive Employees (the "SOA Form") that the Company expects to use for future grants of non-qualified stock options to executive officers under the Plan, (iii) a form of amendment (the "Amendment") that the Company expects to use to amend or supersede, as the case may be, existing agreements between the Company and its executive officers relating to restricted stock and stock option awards (the "Existing Award Agreements") and (iv) the Company's Senior Management Change in Control Severance Policy (the "Policy"), under which severance benefits will be provided to eligible executive officers of the Company in the event their employment terminates under certain conditions within one year following a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Policy). The revisions to the RSA Form, the SOA Form, the Existing Award Agreements and the Policy are intended to conform the change in control provisions therein with revised change in control provisions summarized below.
 
Under the revised change in control provisions, if an executive officer's restricted stock or stock option grants are assumed or converted in connection with a "Change in Control," and if the executive officer's business relationship with the Company or its successor is terminated within one year after the Change in Control without "Good Cause" by the Company or its successor or with "Good Reason" by the executive officer, then unvested restricted stock and stock option grants would vest. If an executive officer's restricted stock is not assumed or converted in connection with a Change in Control, then the restricted stock would be treated as vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. If an executive officer's stock option grants are not assumed or converted in connection with a Change in Control, then the executive would receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount based in part on the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option grant on the day preceding the Change in Control.
For purposes of the revised change in control provisions, the definitions of certain defined terms are summarized below.
"Change in Control" means (i) subject to certain exceptions, incumbent directors ceasing to constitute a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, a person or entity acquiring beneficial ownership of 35% or more of the Company's voting securities, (iii) the consummation of a business combination such as a merger that meets certain requirements, (iv) stockholder approval of a plan to liquidate the Company or the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or (v) the occurrence of any other event that the Company's Board of Directors determines constitutes a Change in Control.
"Good Cause" means (i) the conviction of the executive officer of, or plea of by the executive officer to, a felony, (ii) willful misconduct by the executive officer resulting in material harm to the Company, (iii) fraud, embezzlement, theft or dishonesty by the executive officer against the Company or any subsidiary or repeated and continuing failure to substantially perform the executive officer's duties with the Company after written notice of such failure to perform, resulting in any case in material harm to the Company or (iv) the executive officer's material breach of any term of confidentiality and/or non-competition agreements with the Company.
nolo contendere
"Good Reason" means (i) a reduction by the Company or its successor of more than 10% in the executive officer's rate of annual base salary or annual target bonus opportunity, (ii) a significant and substantial reduction of the executive officer's responsibilities and authority, (iii) a material adverse change in the executive officer's reporting relationship or (iv) any requirement that the executive officer be based anywhere more than fifty (50) miles from the executive officer's primary office location at the time of the Change in Control.
The foregoing description of the revised change in control provisions, as well as the summary of the Amendment and the revisions to the RSA Form, the SOA Form and the Policy, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the provisions of (i) the Form of Restricted Stock Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein, (ii) the Form of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement for Executive Employees filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and incorporated by reference herein, (iii) the Form of Amendment to Equity Awards filed as Exhibit 10.4 hereto and incorporated by reference herein and (iv) the terms of the Senior Management Change in Control Severance Policy filed as Exhibit 10.5 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
This Agreement is made as of the day of 200    , by and between Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation), and (the "Indemnitee"), a director or officer of the Corporation.
    
            
                    
WHEREAS, it is essential to the Corporation to retain and attract as directors and officers the most capable persons available, and
WHEREAS, the substantial increase in corporate litigation subjects directors and officers to expensive litigation risks at the same time that the availability of directors' and officers' liability insurance has been severely limited, and
WHEREAS, it is now and has always been the express policy of the Corporation to indemnify its directors and officers, and
WHEREAS, the Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and
WHEREAS, the Corporation desires the Indemnitee to serve, or continue to serve, as a director or officer of the Corporation.
NOW THEREFORE, the Corporation and the Indemnitee do hereby agree as follows:
1. . The Indemnitee agrees to serve or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation for so long as the Indemnitee is duly elected or appointed or until such time as the Indemnitee tenders a resignation in writing.

(d) The term "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any one of the following:
(i) individuals who, on the date of this Agreement, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Directors") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, provided that any person becoming a director subsequent to the date of this Agreement whose election or nomination for election was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Directors then on the Board (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Corporation in which such person is named as a nominee for director, without written objection to such nomination) shall be an Incumbent Director; provided, however, that no individual initially elected or nominated as a director of the Corporation as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to directors or as a result of any other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies by or on behalf of any person other than the Board shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director;
(ii) any "person" (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and as used in Sections 13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes a "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities eligible to vote for the election of the Board (the "Corporation Voting Securities"); provided, however, that the event described in this paragraph (ii) shall not be deemed to be a Change in Control by virtue of any of the following acquisitions: (A) by the Corporation or any subsidiary, (B) by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Corporation or any subsidiary, (C) by any underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, (D) pursuant to a Non-Qualifying Transaction, as defined in paragraph (iii), or (E) by any person of Voting Securities from the Corporation, if a majority of the Incumbent Board approves in advance the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of Corporation Voting Securities by such person;
(iii) the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries that requires the approval of the Corporation's stockholders, whether for such transaction or the issuance of securities in the transaction (a "Business Combination"), unless immediately following such Business Combination: (A) more than 50% of the total voting power of (x) the corporation resulting from such Business Combination (the "Surviving Corporation"), or (y) if applicable, the ultimate parent corporation that directly or indirectly has beneficial ownership of 100% of the voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Surviving Corporation (the "Parent Corporation"), is represented by Corporation Voting Securities that were outstanding immediately prior to such Business Combination (or, if applicable, is represented by shares into which such Corporation Voting Securities were converted pursuant to such Business Combination), and such voting power among the holders thereof is in substantially
 
the same proportion as the voting power of such Corporation Voting Securities among the holders thereof immediately prior to the Business Combination, (B) no person (other than any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent Corporation), is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 25% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding voting securities eligible to elect directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation) and (C) at least half of the members of the board of directors of the Parent Corporation (or, if there is no Parent Corporation, the Surviving Corporation) following the consummation of the Business Combination were Incumbent Directors at the time of the Board's approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Combination (any Business Combination which satisfies all of the criteria specified in (A), (B) and (C) above shall be deemed to be a "Non-Qualifying Transaction");
(iv) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Corporation or the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets; or
(v) the occurrence of any other event that the Board determines by a duly approved resolution constitutes a Change in Control.
(e) The term "Special Independent Counsel" shall mean a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither currently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Corporation or the Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party or (ii) any other party to the Proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Special Independent Counsel" shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Corporation or the Indemnitee in an action to determine the Indemnitee's rights under this Agreement.
(f) References to "other enterprise" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise tax assessed with respect to any employee benefit plan; references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Agreement.
3. . Subject to Sections 6, 7 and 9, the Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding as to which the Indemnitee is, was or is threatened to be made a party (or is otherwise involved) by reason of the Indemnitee's Corporate Status, to the fullest extent permitted by law (as such may be amended from time to time). In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof:
Indemnity of Indemnitee
 
(a) . The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(a) if the Indemnitee was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding (other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor or a Proceeding referred to in Section 6 below) by reason of the Indemnitee's Corporate Status or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in connection therewith, against all Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Indemnification in Third-Party Proceedings
(b) . The Corporation shall indemnify the Indemnitee in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(b) if the Indemnitee was or is a party to or threatened to be made a party to or otherwise involved in any Proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the Indemnitee's Corporate Status or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in connection therewith, against all Expenses and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, except that, if applicable law so provides, no indemnification shall be made under this Section 3(b) in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such Expenses as the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Indemnification in Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
4. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any Proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein (other than a Proceeding referred to in Section 6), the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, if any Proceeding or any claim, issue or matter therein is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to the Indemnitee, (ii) an adjudication that the Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a plea of guilty or by the Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and (v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that the Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, the Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been wholly successful with respect thereto.
Indemnification of Expenses of Successful Party
nolo
contendere
5. . To the extent that the Indemnitee is, by reason of the Indemnitee's Corporate Status, a witness in any Proceeding to which the Indemnitee is not a party, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection therewith.
Indemnification for Expenses of a Witness
 
6. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary to this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 10, the Corporation shall not indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the Indemnitee unless (a) the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or (b) the Proceeding was commenced following a Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Corporation shall not indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent the Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, the Indemnitee shall promptly refund such indemnification payments to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.
Exceptions to Right of Indemnification
7. . As a condition precedent to the Indemnitee's right to be indemnified, the Indemnitee must notify the Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any Proceeding for which indemnity will or could be sought. With respect to any Proceeding of which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to the Indemnitee of its election so to assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding, other than as provided below in this Section 7. The Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such Proceeding, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to the Indemnitee shall have reasonably determined that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between the Corporation and the Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such Proceeding or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding, in each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for the Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement, and provided that Indemnitee's counsel shall cooperate reasonably with the Corporation's counsel to minimize the cost of defending claims against the Corporation and the Indemnitee. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for the Indemnitee shall have reasonably made the determination provided for in clause (ii) above. The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any Proceeding in any manner that would impose any penalty or limitation on the Indemnitee without the Indemnitee's written consent. Neither the Corporation nor the Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or delay their consent to any proposed settlement.
Notification and Defense of Claim
8. . Subject to the provisions of Section 9, in the event that the Corporation does not assume the defense pursuant to Section 7 of any Proceeding of
Advancement of Expenses
 
which the Corporation receives notice under this Agreement, any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in defending such Proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding; , , that the payment of such Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Agreement. Such undertaking shall be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the Indemnitee to make repayment. Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this Section 8 shall be unsecured and interest-free.
provided
however
9. .
Procedures
(a) In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of Expenses pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request, including in such request such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Any such indemnification or advancement of Expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within (i) in the case of indemnification under Sections 4, 5 or 9(d) or advancement of Expenses under Section 8, 30 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, or (ii) in the case of all other indemnification, 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of the Indemnitee, unless with respect to requests under this clause (ii) the Corporation determines within the applicable 30 or 60-day period referred to above that the Indemnitee did not meet the standard of conduct set forth in Section 3(a) above. Such determination, and any determination that advanced Expenses must be repaid to the Corporation, shall be made as follows:
(x) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, by Special Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, a copy of which shall be delivered to the Indemnitee (unless the Indemnitee shall request that such determination be made by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in which case the determination shall be made in the manner provided below in clauses (y)(1) or (y)(2)).
(y) in all other cases, in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, (1) by a majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the Proceeding ("disinterested directors"), whether or not a quorum, (2) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by a majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (3) if there are no disinterested directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion to the Board, or (4) by the stockholders of the Corporation.
(b) In the event that a Change in Control shall have occurred and the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Special Independent Counsel, the Special Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this Section 9(b). The Special Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Indemnitee, unless the Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The party making the determination shall give written notice to the other party advising it of the identity of the Special
 
Independent Counsel so selected. The party receiving such notice may, within seven days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the other party a written objection to such selection. Such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Special Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Special Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Special Independent Counsel. If a written objection is made, the Special Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Special Independent Counsel unless and until a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by the Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification, no Special Independent Counsel shall have been selected or if selected, shall have been objected to, in accordance with this paragraph either the Corporation or the Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Corporation or the Indemnitee to the other's selection of Special Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Special Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom an objection is favorably resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Special Independent Counsel. The Corporation shall pay the reasonable and necessary fees and expenses of Special Independent Counsel incurred in connection with its acting in such capacity. The Corporation shall pay any and all reasonable and necessary fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this paragraph, regardless of the manner in which such Special Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement, any Special Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
(c) The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner that the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
(d) The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in so cooperating shall be borne by the Corporation (irrespective of the determination as to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Corporation hereby indemnifies the Indemnitee therefrom.
10. . The right to indemnification or advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall be enforceable by the Indemnitee in any court of competent jurisdiction if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within the applicable period referred to in Section 9. Unless otherwise required by law, the burden of proving that indemnification or advancement of Expenses is not appropriate shall be
Remedies
 
on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The Indemnitee's Expenses actually and reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing the Indemnitee's right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such Proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. The Corporation shall provide to the Indemnitee such information and documentation as the Indemnitee shall reasonably request in connection with any attempt by the Indemnitee to enforce his or her rights under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with any Proceeding in which the Indemnitee may be involved by reason of his or her Corporate Status.
11. . If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Corporation for some or a portion of the Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion of such Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in settlement to which the Indemnitee is entitled.
Partial Indemnification
12. . In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Corporation to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Subrogation
13. . This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of (a) six years after the date that the Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a director or officer of the Corporation or, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner, trustee, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, limited liability company or other enterprise or (b) the final termination of all Proceedings pending on the date set forth in clause (a) in respect of which the Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by the Indemnitee pursuant to Section 10 of this Agreement relating thereto.
Term of Agreement
14. . The indemnification and advancement of Expenses provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Indemnitee may be entitled under the Certification of Incorporation, the By-Laws, any other agreement, any vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, the General Corporation Law of Delaware, any other law (common or statutory), or otherwise, both as to action in the Indemnitee's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office for the Corporation. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Corporation from purchasing and maintaining insurance, at its expense, to protect itself or the Indemnitee against any expense, liability or loss incurred by it or the Indemnitee in any such capacity, or arising out of the Indemnitee's status as such, whether or not the Indemnitee would be indemnified against such expense, liability or loss under this Agreement.
Indemnification Hereunder Not Exclusive
 
15. . Nothing herein shall confer upon the Indemnitee any right to continue to serve as an officer or director of the Corporation for any period of time or at any particular rate of compensation.
No Special Rights
16. . If this Agreement or any portion thereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee as to Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any Proceeding to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Agreement that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

Exhibit 10.2
Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation, hereby grants as of the date below (the "Grant Date") to the person named below (the "Participant") and the Participant hereby accepts, the number of restricted shares (the "Restricted Stock") listed below of the Company's common stock, $.0001 par value per share, with a vesting start date (the "Vesting Start Date") listed below, such grant to be on the terms and conditions specified in the Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan and in the attached .

. The Restricted Stock is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "") and, unless the context otherwise requires, terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan or shall be defined as on the cover sheet attached hereto. Determinations made in connection with the Restricted Stock pursuant to the Plan shall be governed by the Plan as it exists on the Grant Date.
1. Grant under Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Plan
. All of the shares of Restricted Stock initially shall be unvested shares. For so long as the Participant maintains continuous service to the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates as an employee, officer, director or consultant (a "") throughout the period beginning on the Grant Date and ending on the vesting date set forth below, the Restricted Stock shall become vested according to the schedule set forth below, subject to Section 3 hereof:
2. Vesting if Business Relationship Continues
Business Relationship
 
 
Until the Restricted Stock vests, as provided in this Section and in Section 3, the Participant may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of the Restricted Stock.
If the Participant's Business Relationship is terminated for any reason, the shares of Restricted Stock that were not vested on the date of such termination will be forfeited. The shares of Restricted Stock that are forfeited will be cancelled and returned to the Company. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship shall not be considered as having terminated during any leave of absence if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company; in the event of such leave of absence, vesting of the Restricted Stock shall be suspended (and the period of the leave of absence shall be added to all vesting dates) unless otherwise determined by the Company. The vesting of the Restricted Stock shall not be affected by any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
.
3. Termination of Business Relationship
. Each certificate issued in respect of shares of Restricted Stock under the Agreement shall be registered in the Participant's name and deposited by the Participant, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company and shall bear the following (or a similar) legend:
4. Legend
"The transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock represented hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) contained in an Agreement entered into between the registered owner and Red Hat, Inc."
 
When the Restricted Stock vests, the Company shall redeliver to the Participant (or the Participant's legal representatives, beneficiaries or heirs) from the shares of Restricted Stock deposited with it the number of shares which have then vested. The Participant agrees that any resale of the shares of Restricted Stock received upon vesting shall be made in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or an applicable exemption therefrom, including without limitation the exemption provided by Rule 144 promulgated thereunder (or any successor rule).
. Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Restricted Stock imposes any obligation on the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to have a Business Relationship with the Participant.
5. No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
. Except for the restrictions on transfer and vesting provisions in this Agreement, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock including but not limited to the right to receive dividends paid on the Restricted Stock and the right to vote the Restricted Stock.
6. Rights as Stockholder
. The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of restricted stock in a number of contingencies such as stock split and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for such adjustments are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference.
7. Adjustments for Capital Changes
. Provisions regarding a Change in Control are set forth on Appendix A.
8. Change in Control
. No Restricted Stock will be redelivered pursuant to the vesting thereof unless and until the Participant pays to the Company, or makes satisfactory provision to the Company for payment of, any federal, state or local withholding taxes required by law to be held in respect of this Restricted Stock (the "Tax Amount"). The Participant hereby agrees that the Company may withhold from the Participant's wages or other remuneration the Tax Amount. At the discretion of the Company, the Tax Amount may be withheld in cash from such wages or from other remuneration, or in kind from the
9. Withholding
 
shares or other property otherwise deliverable to the Participant on vesting of this Restricted Stock. The Participant further agrees that, if the Company does not withhold an amount from the Participant's wages or other remuneration sufficient to satisfy the withholding obligation of the Company, the Participant agrees to indemnify the Company in full for the amount underwithheld and to make reimbursement on demand, in cash, for the amount underwithheld within thirty (30) days after the vesting of the Restricted Stock that gives rise to the withholding obligation. The Participant has reviewed with the Participant's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The Participant is relying solely on such advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. The Participant understands that the Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Participant understands that it may be beneficial in many circumstances to elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Stock is granted rather than when and as the Restricted Stock vests by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within 30 days from the date of grant.
. The Participant agrees that in the event that the Company effects an underwritten public offering of Shares registered under the Securities Act, the Restricted Stock may not be sold, offered for sale or otherwise disposed of, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter(s) of the offering, for such period of time after the execution of an underwriting agreement in connection with such offering that all of the Company's then directors and executive officers agree to be similarly bound.
10. Lock-up Agreement
. By executing this Agreement the Participant acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Agreement (including the cover sheet) and a copy of the Plan.
11. Provision of Documentation to Participant

Furthermore and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if this grant of Restricted Stock is not continued, assumed, converted or substituted for immediately following the Change in Control, all of the Restricted Stock shall be treated as vested immediately prior to the Change in Control.

Exhibit 10.5
 
The purpose of this Senior Management Change in Control Severance Policy (the "Policy") is to diminish the distraction of Covered Executives (as defined below) in the event of a threatened or pending Change in Control (as defined below) and to provide financial assistance to any Covered Executive whose employment with Red Hat, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (the "Company") is terminated under certain circumstances following such a Change in Control.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this Policy, a Change in Control means the occurrence of any one of the following events:
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 35% of the Company Voting Securities as a
result of the acquisition of Company Voting Securities by the Company which reduces the number of Company Voting Securities outstanding; provided, that if after such acquisition by the Company such person becomes the beneficial owner of additional Company Voting Securities that increases the percentage of outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by such person, a Change in Control of the Company shall then occur.
 
If a Covered Executive's employment by the Company shall be terminated by the Company without Good Cause during the 12-month period following a Change in Control or the Covered Executive voluntarily resigns from the Company for Good Reason during the 12-month period following a Change in Control, the Company shall pay the Covered Executive a lump sum cash payment within thirty (30) days after such termination equal to two times the sum of (i) the Covered Executive's current annual base salary plus (ii) an amount equal to the average of the annual bonuses earned by the Covered Executive during the two previous fiscal years. In addition, the Company shall provide for continuation of the Covered Executive's and his or her eligible dependents' coverage under the Company's welfare benefit plans (group life insurance, and comprehensive health, major medical, dental, disability plans) as in effect on the date of termination (or, in connection with the Company's change in benefit plans applicable to employees generally, any coverage substituted for coverage in which the Covered Executive was enrolled on the date of termination) until the earlier of (a) 24 months following the Covered Executive's date of termination or (b) the date the Covered Executive or his or her eligible dependents become eligible for comparable benefits from another employer. The Covered Executive must continue to contribute the employee share of premiums, as from time to time applicable to employees of the Company generally, in order to continue such coverage. In addition, the Covered Executive shall receive a pro-rata incentive bonus (if any) to which he or she would have been entitled in accordance with the Company's annual bonus plan calculated through the Covered Executive's termination, but based on the targets achieved prior to the Covered Executive's date of termination. To the extent such targets do not lend themselves to an interim fiscal year calculation, such pro-rata payment shall be deemed to be no less than the annual target incentive payment, pro-rated for partial fiscal year employment.
 
 
 
 
In the event that the Excise Tax is later determined by the Accountant or the Internal Revenue Service to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest or penalties payable with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On March 29, 2007, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2007 and February 28, 2006. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and a reconciliation of GAAP cash flow from operating activities to non-GAAP adjusted cash flow from operating activities based on: o the impact of share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R") versus share-based compensation expense under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB 25"); o the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate; and o the impact of cash flow characterization of excess tax benefits from share-based arrangements under SFAS 123R. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of APB 25, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP share-based compensation expense of $8.0 million and $32.4 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, respectively versus non-GAAP, or what would have been reported had we continued reporting share-based compensation expense under the provisions of APB 25, of $0.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively. During the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $6.5 million and $29.7 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 33.1%. We currently have approximately $400 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007 of $1.7 million and $6.0 million respectively. Likewise, the recorded GAAP income tax benefit of $1.6 million and income tax expense of $2.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2006 was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.3 million and $4.1 million for those respective periods. Our adoption of SFAS 123R also impacts the comparability of our current year cash flows from operating activities with our prior year cash flows from operating activities. SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award's original grant date fair value, the "excess tax benefits", be presented as a source of cash flows from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R, under the provisions of APB 25 we would have presented these excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards as a source of cash flows from operating activities. In the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, we recognized $10.7 million and $16.0 million, respectively, of cash tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the share-based award's original grant date fair value. For improved year-over-year comparability purposes only, we have added these excess cash tax benefits to GAAP cash flows from operating activities resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $56.4 million and $217.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007. Management believes that the adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance. The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

On May 10, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved and adopted the Company's Executive Variable Compensation Plan (the "EVC Plan") and established performance objectives that will be used to determine the amounts payable to the Company's executive officers for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2008 ("FY2008") under the EVC Plan.
The EVC Plan
The EVC Plan is designed to motivate and reward key management employees whose efforts impact the Company's performance. Participation in the EVC Plan is subject to certain eligibility restrictions. The EVC Plan is a component plan of the Company's 2006 Performance Compensation Plan ("PCP") with respect to employees who participate in the PCP. Under the EVC Plan, performance is measured during the Company's fiscal year (the "Performance Period"). The Committee approves financial performance objectives and individual performance objectives for participants as well as the percentage of each to be used in determining awards. Individual performance objectives must be determined in writing and discussed with each of the EVC Plan participants during the first half of the Performance Period and upon conclusion of the Performance Period.
The Committee establishes a target award payment for each eligible participant. The target award represents the expected level of performance, which results in a payment equal to 100% of the target award. The maximum award under the EVC Plan is limited to 200% of the target award, and the threshold award under the EVC Plan is limited to 25% of the target award. In no event may the amount of an award under the EVC Plan to an employee exceed the limit on grants prescribed by the Committee and the PCP. The attainment of financial performance objectives are measured based upon actual financial results versus the financial targets established under the EVC Plan. Bonus awards under the EVC Plan are expressed as a percentage of a participant's target bonus award.
All awards under the EVC Plan must be approved by the Committee. The Committee may, under certain circumstances involving the occurrence of unanticipated economic or market conditions that render the pre-established financial performance objectives unattainable, permit the payment of not more than 50% of the target bonus award for participants, in its discretion. In addition, the Committee, in its discretion, also may modify pre-established financial performance objectives for the Performance Period or, subject to certain limitations, may make a bonus payment under the EVC Plan that is higher or lower than the amount calculated on the basis of the financial and individual performance objectives of the award, provided that the maximum payment may not exceed 200% of the target award. Any awards generated during the Performance Period will be paid no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year of the Company in which the applicable Performance Period ends. Payments under the EVC Plan are subject to proration for participants not employed by the Company for the full Performance Period, and participants are not eligible to receive an award under the EVC Plan if they are terminated by reason other than retirement or economic reduction in workforce.
The foregoing summary of terms of the EVC Plan is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the EVC Plan, which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Performance Objectives
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives for FY2008 under the EVC Plan for each eligible participant are based on the Company's achievement of (a) a specified dollar amount of net revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flows from operations, excluding the impact
of the reclassification of "excess tax benefits" from share-based compensation as cash flows from financing activities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("FAS 123R"), and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense under FAS 123R, for FY2008. The established financial performance objectives, other than the amount of net revenues, are non-GAAP financial measures.
For FY2008, the Committee determined that 75% of a participant's bonus award under the EVC Plan will be based upon those financial performance objectives and 25% of a participant's bonus award under the EVC Plan will be based on individual performance objectives that may include subjective factors for individual participants, such as business strategy development and implementation, succession planning, retention of key employees and executive development. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance objectives discussed above will represent 25% of the award. With respect to each financial metric and the individual performance objectives metric, payments may range from 0  50% of the target bonus award per metric.
The following named executive officers are participants in the EVC Plan for FY2008:
Matthew J. Szulik, President and Chief Executive Officer
Charles E. Peters, Jr., Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Alex Pinchev, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales
Joanne Rohde, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations
Paul J. Cormier, Executive Vice President, Engineering
The Committee has not yet determined the amount of each participant's target bonus award for FY2008 but has determined that such target bonus awards may range from 10% to 100% of each participant's base salary at the beginning or the conclusion of the Performance Period, as determined by the Committee.
 
(d) Exhibits
See Exhibit Index attached hereto.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat, Inc.'s Executive Variable Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is set forth below.
 
The Plan has been designed to motivate and reward key management employees whose efforts impact the performance of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries through the achievement of pre-established financial and individual objectives.
Performance under the Plan is measured during the performance period (the Company's fiscal year) and payments under the Plan are made following the end of the performance period.
 
Officers and key management employees may be eligible to participate in the Plan, upon the recommendation by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and approval by the Compensation Committee ("Committee"). An employee who is eligible to participate in any other cash incentive plan of the Company, other than the Company's 2006 Performance Compensation Plan (the "2006 PCP"), is not eligible to participate in this Plan. This Plan is a component plan of the 2006 PCP with respect to employees who participate in the 2006 PCP.
 
The Committee must approve the Company performance objectives and individual objectives that are used to determine awards paid under this Plan as well as the percentage of each to be used in determining awards. Individual objectives must be determined in writing and discussed with each of the Plan participants during the first half of the performance period and upon conclusion of the performance period.
 
A Target Award payment is established for each eligible participant. Target Awards remain fixed even if the participant's base pay in effect at the beginning or the conclusion of the performance period changes. Pro rata amounts are provided for participants hired or terminated during the fiscal year. Generally, the participants receive the Target Award when performance under the Plan meets the pre-established performance objectives.
Payouts under the Plan will be in accordance with the Plan and the mechanism established by the Committee for determining payouts. The weight applied to each component of an award will be determined by the Committee and may vary for each participant.
The Target Award represents the expected level of performance which results in a payment equal to 100% of the Target Award. The maximum award under the Plan is limited to 200% of the Target Award, and the threshold award under the Plan is limited to 25% of the Target Award. In no event may the amount of an award under the Plan to an employee exceed the limit on grants prescribed by the Committee and the 2006 PCP.
Attainment of the financial objectives of the Plan is measured based on actual results versus Plan targets. Payouts are expressed as a percentage of the Target Award for each participant versus actual levels of financial performance. If actual results are between stated percentages, interpolations of payout percentages are to be applied.
 
The Committee shall approve the use of individual objectives as part of the participant's performance criteria under the Plan. The use of individual objectives is subject to the following requirements:
 
 
 
There may be circumstances under which the financial performance of the Company does not generate an award under the Plan. The nature and scope of the Company's operations are such that at times unanticipated economic and market conditions may render pre-established financial objectives unattainable in any given performance period. If, in the opinion of the Committee, such circumstances should arise, then bonus payments not to exceed 50% of the Target Award may be paid.
 
If, during a performance period, there has occurred or should occur, in the opinion of the Committee, a significant beneficial or adverse change in economic conditions, the indicators of growth or recession in the Company's business segments, the nature of the operations of the Company, or applicable laws, regulations or accounting practices, or other matters which were not anticipated by the Committee when it approved objectives for the performance period and which, in the Committee's judgment, had, have, or are expected to have a substantial positive or negative effect on the performance of the Company as a whole, the Committee may modify or revise the financial performance objectives for the performance period in such a manner as it may deem appropriate in its sole judgment. By way of illustration, and not limitation, such significant changes might result from sales of assets, or mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs.
 
Any awards generated under the Plan must be approved by the Committee. The Committee, in its discretion, subject to the last paragraph of this Article IX, may make payment of a bonus under the Plan in an amount that is higher or lower than the amount calculated on the basis of the financial and individual objectives of the award; provided, however, that the maximum bonus payable to a participant under the Plan shall not exceed 200% of such participant's Target Award. Any awards generated during the performance period will be paid no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year of the Company in which the applicable performance period ends, subject to prior notification and approval by the Committee.
Participants hired during the fiscal year will receive a prorated bonus based upon the actual date of hire. Employees terminating prior to the payout date are not eligible for payment of any award under this Plan unless termination is due to retirement or economic reduction in force. In
such cases, any bonus payments will be prorated to the date of termination and determined on the basis of bonuses actually paid to similarly situated employees.
This Plan is a component plan of the 2006 PCP with respect to employees who participate in the 2006 PCP. In no event may the amount of an award under the Plan to an employee participating in the 2006 PCP exceed the limit on grants prescribed by the Committee and the 2006 PCP.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On June 27, 2007, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended May 31, 2007. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a reconciliation of GAAP cash flows from operating activities to non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities based on: o the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); o the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate; and o the impact of cash flow characterization of excess tax benefits from share-based arrangements under SFAS 123R. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies. Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months ended May 31, 2007 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $8.4 million and $7.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2007 and May 31, 2006, respectively versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense. We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance. Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
During the three months ended May 31, 2007, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $10.8 million, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 40%. We currently have approximately $450 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for this period to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months ended May 31, 2007 of $1.8 million. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $8.0 million for the three months ended May 31, 2006 was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.5 million for that period. Our adoption of SFAS 123R also impacts the comparability of our cash flows from operating activities for periods subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 123R with our cash flows from operating activities for prior periods. SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award's original grant date fair value, the "excess tax benefits", be presented as a source of cash flows from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R, under the provisions of APB 25 we would have presented these excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards as a source of cash flows from operating activities. In the three months ended May 31, 2007, we recognized $12.6 million of cash tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the share-based award's original grant date fair value. For improved comparability with prior periods, we have added these excess cash tax benefits to GAAP cash flows from operating activities, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $52.3 million for the three months ended May 31, 2007. Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition On September 25, 2007, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2007. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007 and August 31, 2006. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a reconciliation of GAAP cash flows from operating activities to non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities based on: o the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); o the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate; and o the impact of cash flow characterization of excess tax benefits from share-based arrangements under SFAS 123R. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies. Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007 and August 31, 2006 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $8.6 million and $17.0 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007 and $8.3 million and $15.9 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense. We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance. Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance. During the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.1 million and $22.9 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 40%. We currently have approximately $359.0 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007 of $1.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $6.5 million and $14.6 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.3 million and $2.8 million for these periods. Our adoption of SFAS 123R also impacts the comparability of our cash flows from operating activities for periods subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 123R with our cash flows from operating activities for prior periods. SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award's original grant date fair value, the "excess tax benefits", be presented as a source of cash flows from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R, under the provisions of APB 25 we would have presented these excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards as a source of cash flows from operating activities. In the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007, we recognized $14.5 million and $27.1 million, respectively, of cash tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the share-based award's original grant date fair value. For improved comparability with prior periods, we have added these excess cash tax benefits to GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $49.2 million and $88.9 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2007, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $63.7 million and $116.0 million, respectively, for these periods. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $43.9 million and $96.3 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2006, was adjusted to reflect the addition of recognized excess cash tax benefits of $0.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $44.6 million and $99.1 million for these periods.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management. The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Effective October 12, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved a form of Performance Share Unit Agreement (the "PSU Agreement") for use with grants of performance share units ("PSUs") to executive officers under the Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). Each PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, subject to the terms and conditions of the PSU Agreement, and such settlement will be made within 60 days following the Compensation Committee's certification in writing of the number of PSUs earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year. If the Company distributes shares to settle the PSUs that are earned, it may withhold from the award a number of shares equal to the applicable withholding tax. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the PSU Agreement or the Plan.
Under the PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted a performance share unit award for a target number of PSUs ("Target Performance Share Units"), and depending on the Company's financial performance, the executive may earn up to 200% of the Target Performance Share Units (the "Maximum Performance Share Units") over a performance period with three separate performance segments corresponding to three fiscal years of the Company (the "Performance Period"). Up to 20% of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first Measuring Year, in the Performance Period; up to 50% of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second Measuring Year in the Performance Period, less the amount earned in the prior year; and up to 100% of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the third Measuring Year in the Performance Period, less the amount earned in the two prior years. The number of PSUs earned, according to the specified formula in the PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage EBIT Growth (the "Performance Goals"), as compared to the performance of certain specified peer group companies (the "Peer Group") during each such year of the Performance Period with respect to the same Performance Goals. Each PSU earned will entitle the executive to one share of common stock.
If the executive's continuous service to the Company or its affiliates as an employee, consultant or director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, any then unearned PSUs will be forfeited. If the executive's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability or by reason of the Company's termination of executive without Good Cause, the executive will be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned PSUs for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased.
If a Change in Control occurs, and provided the executive's Business Relationship with the Company or its affiliate has not ceased, the Compensation Committee may determine that either (i) all of the shares underlying the performance share unit award that have not previously been paid or earned will be treated as earned to the Target Performance Share Unit level and will be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control or (ii) the PSU Agreement will be "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for", immediately following a Change in Control, using restricted stock of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation. The restricted stock will vest on the basis of time of service by the executive, with 25% of such stock being vested as of the first anniversary of the PSU grant date, 50% as of the second anniversary, and 100% as of the third anniversary (to the extent that the end of the applicable year in the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control). If the executive's employment with the Company or an affiliate is terminated by the Company
without Good Cause, by the executive for Good Reason or by reason of the executive's death or Disability within 12 months following such Change in Control, all of the restricted stock will become fully vested on such termination.
The foregoing description of the terms of the PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

By accepting this Award, the Participant hereby (i) acknowledges that a copy of the Plan and a copy of the Plan prospectus have been delivered to the Participant and additional copies thereof are available upon request from the Company's Equity Compensation Department and can also be accessed electronically, (ii) acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Cover Sheet, and and thereto (collectively, the "Agreement") and accepts the Award subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Agreement; (iii) represents that the Participant has read
Exhibit A
Appendix A
and understands the Plan, the Plan prospectus and the Agreement, and (iv) acknowledges that there are tax consequences related to the Award and that the Participant should consult a tax advisor to determine his or her actual tax consequences.

1. .
Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares". The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The overall Performance Period consists of three separate performance segments corresponding to the three fiscal years of the Company that end with the end of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during the segments ending February 28, 2009 and February 28, 2010 are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the Company's financial performance as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goals set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goals, all as further described herein.
3.
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goals are Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage EBIT Growth. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goals
(i) "Base Fiscal Year" for each member ("Peer") of the Peer Group and for the Company (each, an "Entity") means its full fiscal year that ends immediately before the beginning of the Performance Period;
 
(ii) "Measuring Year" means, for each Entity, its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the respective Company fiscal year for which performance goals are being measured within the Performance Period;
(iii) "Percentage Revenue Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Revenue for such Entity's Measuring Year and (y) Revenue for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(iv) "Percentage EBIT Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) EBIT for such Entity's Measuring Year, and (y) EBIT for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year, by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(v) "Revenue" means gross revenue as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP;
(vi) "EBIT" means earnings before interest and income taxes as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and
(vii) "U.S. GAAP" means generally accepted accounting principles used in the U.S.
The elements of each performance goal shall be as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussions and analysis, or other filings of the applicable Entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission. EBIT shall exclude unusual or non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in applicable tax and accounting rules, to the extent consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, except as the Committee may otherwise determine.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of Akamai Technologies, Autodesk, BEA Systems, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, Citrix Systems, Compuware, Jack Henry & Associates, McAfee, Micros Systems, Novell, Real Networks, Sybase, Tibco Software, Verisign and Wind River Systems. If any Peer ceases to be a public company during any Measuring Year (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a Peer for such Measuring Year and all remaining Measuring Years in the Performance Period. If any Peer fails to file its annual audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 1 following the end of any Measuring Year, it shall be treated as if it was not a Peer for such Measuring Year.
Peer Group
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of each Company Measuring Year in the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to each of the Performance Goals shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to each Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group and listed in descending order of Percentage Revenue Growth or Percentage EBIT Growth, whichever
Determining Company Performance
 
is being measured for such Measuring Year (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for such Measuring Year plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 17). The percentile rank for each Performance Goal shall then be averaged, taking each into account equally (resulting in the "Average Percentile Rank").
(ii) Up to twenty percent (20%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first Measuring Year in the Performance Period; up to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amount earned in the first Measuring Year); and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the third Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amounts earned in the first and second Measuring Years).
Maximum Performance Share Units Earned.
(iii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be calculated by multiplying (a) times (b), and that product times (c), and that product less (d), where (a) is the payout percentage as determined under the following table based on the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such Measuring Year, (b) is the maximum percentage of the Maximum Performance Share Units that may be earned as determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c)(ii) for the Measuring Year in question, (c) is the Number of Target Performance Share Units, and (d) is the number of Performance Share Units earned in prior Measuring Years. The number of Shares distributed will equal the number of Performance Share Units earned under this provision.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the Average Percentile Rank for each Measuring Year shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the Average Percentile Rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
 
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section. The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship shall not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
Continuous Service Relationship
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in ), the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essentials duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
 
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, with respect to which the Performance Share Units were earned, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. . Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
 
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship.
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .
No Rights as Stockholder
Appendix A
10. . The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of Performance Share Units (and Restricted Stock) in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for such adjustments are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference.
Adjustments for Capital Changes
11. . Provisions regarding a Change in Control are set forth in .
Change in Control
Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (of payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section.
 
The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

(e) . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the heirs, legatees, distributees, executors and administrators of the Participant and the successors and assigns of the Company.
Successors and Assigns
(f) . The Participant is urged to read this Agreement carefully and to consult with his or her own legal counsel regarding the terms and consequences of this Agreement and the legal and binding effect of this Agreement. By virtue of his or her acceptance of this Agreement, the Participant is deemed to have accepted and agreed to all of the terms and conditions of this Award and the provisions of the Plan, including as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or interpretations of the Committee upon any questions arising under the Plan or this Award.
Participant's Acceptance
(g) . This Agreement, the Performance Share Units and payments made pursuant to this Agreement are intended to comply with or qualify for an exemption from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") and shall be construed consistently therewith and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with that intention. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend the Plan and/or this Agreement to ensure that all Performance Share Units are awarded in a manner that qualifies for exemption from or complies with Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to this Award of Performance Share Units. Any payments described in this Section 13(g) that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant hereby agrees that he is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of separation from service (as determined under Section 409A (the "New Payment Date")), except as Section 409A may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have
Section 409A
 
been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.
(h) . This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of the conflicts of laws thereof. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties, evidenced by this Award or the Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of North Carolina and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Wake County, North Carolina, or the federal courts for the United States for the Tenth District of North Carolina, and no other courts, where this Award is made and/or to be performed.
Governing Law/Choice of Venue
(i) . The Committee will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) have been earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock)). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith will be final and binding upon Participant, the Company and all other interested persons.
Administrator Authority
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control and provided the Participant's Business Relationship with the Company or Affiliate has not ceased, either (i) this Agreement will be continued, assumed, converted, or substituted for (consistent with paragraph (c) below) immediately following a Change in Control using restricted stock (the "Restricted Stock") of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation (the latter two terms as defined below) and subject to the vesting schedule in paragraph (b) below or (ii) all of the Shares underlying the Performance Share Unit award that have not previously been paid or earned shall be treated as earned (to the Target Performance Share Unit level) and shall be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control. The Committee shall determine the actions under this paragraph (a).
(b) The Restricted Stock shall become vested (measuring vesting years from the Grant Date of the Performance Share Units) in accordance with the following schedule if the Participant's Business Relationship continues (to the extent that the end of the applicable year in the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control):
 
If the Participant's employment with the Company or Affiliate is terminated by the Company without Good Cause, by the Participant for Good Reason, or by reason of the Participant's death or Disability within 12 months following such Change in Control, all of the Restricted Stock shall become fully vested on such termination.
(c) For purposes of this Appendix A, this Agreement shall be considered to be continued, assumed, converted or substituted for:
(i) if there is no change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and the Change in Control does not result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction, and there are no changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that materially and adversely affect this Agreement; or
(ii) if there is a change in the number of such outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and/or the Change in Control does result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction:
 
 
 
 
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the assigned meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 35% of the Company Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Company Voting Securities by the Company which reduces the number of Company Voting Securities outstanding; , if after such acquisition by the Company such person becomes the beneficial owner of additional Company Voting Securities that increases the percentage of outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by such person, a Change in Control of the Company shall then occur.

Executive Base Salaries
The annual base salaries for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Target Bonus Amounts under the EVC Plan
The target bonus amounts for FY2008 for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers under the EVC Plan, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The EVC Plan, approved and adopted by the Committee on May 10, 2007, is designed to motivate and reward key management employees whose efforts impact the Company's performance. Generally, the amount of a participant's cash bonus award under the EVC Plan is based upon the Company's achievement of financial performance objectives and individual performance objectives approved by the Committee. The attainment of financial performance objectives is measured based upon actual financial results versus the financial targets established under the EVC Plan. Actual cash bonus awards under the EVC Plan are expressed as a percentage of a participant's target bonus amount. The target award represents the expected level of performance, which results in a payment equal to 100% of the target award. The maximum award under the EVC Plan is limited to 200% of a participant's target bonus amount, and the threshold award under the EVC Plan is limited to 25% of the target award.
For a more detailed discussion of the EVC Plan, the financial performance objectives approved by the Committee for FY2008 under the EVC Plan and the extent to which actual cash bonus awards for FY2008 will be based on financial performance objectives and individual performance objectives, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on May 16, 2007.

         On December 20, 2007, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2007. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
         We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007 and November 30, 2006. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a reconciliation of GAAP cash flows from operating activities to non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities based on:
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
         Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
         Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007 and November 30, 2006 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $9.5 million and $26.4 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007 and $8.5 million and $24.4 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
         We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of  profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
         During the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.0 million and $34.9 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 39%. We currently have approximately $300.0 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% for the foreseeable future. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007 of $2.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $8.6 million and $23.2 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.6 million and $4.4 million for these periods.
         Our adoption of SFAS 123R also impacts the comparability of our cash flows from operating activities for periods subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 123R with our cash flows from operating activities for prior periods. SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award's original grant date fair value, the "excess tax benefits", be presented as a source of cash flows from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R, under the provisions of APB 25 we would have presented these excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards as a source of cash flows from operating activities.
         In the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007, we recognized $17.1 million and $44.2 million, respectively, of cash tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the share-based award's original grant date fair value. For improved comparability with prior periods, we have added these excess cash tax benefits to GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $59.6 million and $148.6 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2007, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $76.7 million and $192.8 million, respectively, for these periods.  In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $59.7 million and $155.9 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2006, was adjusted to reflect the addition of recognized excess cash tax benefits of $2.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $62.0 million and $161.2 million for these periods.
 
 
 
 
         Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.
         The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Mr. Whitehurst and the Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement, dated as of December 19, 2007 (the "Employment Agreement"), pursuant to which Mr. Whitehurst will receive an initial base salary of $700,000 per annum and be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus in an amount equal to 100% of his base salary in effect at the beginning of such fiscal year and may receive up to 200% of his base salary, as determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Company has also agreed to pay up to $150,000 in the aggregate for Mr. Whitehurst's reasonable relocation expenses incurred in his move from the Atlanta, Georgia area and a tax gross-up related to the taxable portion of any reimbursement of these relocation expenses. If Mr. Whitehurst is unable to sell his current principal residence in Atlanta, Georgia, within a commercially reasonable period of time, then the Company will provide Mr. Whitehurst with an additional $150,000.
Within 10 days of the time that Mr. Whitehurst begins serving as the President and CEO, the Employment Agreement provides that he will be granted options to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 175,000 shares of restricted stock under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Stock Plan"). The options will have a per share exercise price equal to 100% of the closing price of the Company's common stock as traded on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, shall vest in equal amounts on an annual basis over a four year period following the date of grant, and, with limited exceptions, will contain the same terms and conditions as the Company's standard form of non-qualified stock option agreement adopted for use under the Stock Plan. The restricted stock granted to Mr. Whitehurst will vest in equal amounts on an annual basis over a four year period following the date of grant and, with limited exceptions, will contain the same terms and conditions as the Company's standard form of restricted stock agreement adopted for use under the Stock Plan. The Compensation Committee will consider the grant of additional compensatory stock awards to Mr. Whitehurst no less frequently than annually.
If Mr. Whitehurst's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or if Mr. Whitehurst resigns for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), subject to the Company receiving a valid release of claims and Mr. Whitehurst's compliance with certain restrictive covenants, Mr. Whitehurst will be entitled to receive (1) 150% of his then current annualized base salary, (2) a prorated portion of his current target bonus, and (3) health care coverage paid by the Company for himself and his beneficiaries for a period of no longer than 18 months following his termination. In addition, any portion of a prior stock award that is outstanding but unvested and which would otherwise have vested during the subsequent 18 months, will immediately vest. Mr. Whitehurst's right to exercise any outstanding stock options will end on the earlier of the first anniversary of his termination or the expiration of the option's maximum term.
Alternatively, if (a) Mr. Whitehurst's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause either within 3 months prior to or upon or within 24 months following a Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreement), or (b) Mr. Whitehurst terminates his employment for Good Reason upon or within 24 months following the occurrence of a Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the Employment Agreement), subject to the Company receiving a valid release of claims, he will be entitled to receive (1) 200% of his then current annualized base salary, (2) 200% of his then current target bonus, (3) a prorated portion of his then current target bonus, (4) health care coverage paid by the Company for himself and his beneficiaries for a period of no longer than 24 months following his termination, and (5) term life insurance in the same amount of death benefit protection that
he enjoyed under Company-provided life insurance coverage on the date of his termination of employment paid by the Company for a period of 24 months following his termination. In addition, any portion of a prior stock award previously granted to Mr. Whitehurst will immediately vest. If any amounts payable under the Employment Agreement or any other amounts in the nature of compensation, result in the imposition of the "golden parachute" excise tax, Mr. Szulik will receive a tax gross-up payment to offset the tax liabilities created by the excise tax.
Alternatively, if (a) Mr. Whitehurst's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or (b) Mr. Whitehurst resigns without Good Reason, he will be entitled to payment of his base salary through the date his employment is terminated.
 
On December 19, 2007, Mr. Whitehurst was elected to the Board as a Class III director of the Company, with his service as a director commencing at the time that Mr. Whitehurst begins his employment as the President and CEO of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Whitehurst's Employment Agreement, the Board will nominate him to the Board for so long as he remains President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and, if elected, Mr. Whitehurst will serve in such capacity without additional consideration.
 
See description in response to Item 5.02(c) above.

(e) Entry into Material Agreement with Named Executive Officer
As previously disclosed in a current report filed by Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") on December 20, 2007, Matthew Szulik, the Chairman of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company, resigned from his positions as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective January 1, 2008. Since that time, Mr. Szulik has continued to serve as the Chairman of the Board.
Mr. Szulik and the Company have entered into a Non-Executive Chairman Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2008 (the "Chairman Agreement") and an Executive Transition Agreement, dated as of February 28, 2008 (the "Transition Agreement"). Pursuant to the Chairman Agreement, Mr. Szulik will continue to serve as the Chairman of the Board until the end of the Company's fiscal year ending February 28, 2009 ("Fiscal 2009"). Thereafter, the Board and Mr. Szulik may mutually agree to extend his term for an additional fiscal year. There is no limit on the number of times that the Board and Mr. Szulik may agree to extensions of his term. Mr. Szulik's duties will include presiding over Board meetings and coordinating with the Company's new Chief Executive Officer, James M. Whitehurst, to provide support with customer and industry relations and the open source community, provide assistance and guidance regarding the Company's strategy and support investor relations and strategic employee recruiting and retention.
Mr. Szulik will receive $350,000 in annual cash compensation in lieu of director fees and other compensation paid to other non-employee directors. He will be eligible to receive a cash bonus for the Company's fiscal year ending February 29, 2008 ("Fiscal 2008"), and his outstanding stock awards will continue to vest (both of which are addressed in further detail in the discussion of the Transition Agreement below). If Mr. Szulik continues as Chairman beyond the end of Fiscal 2009, his annual cash compensation will be $250,000 per year in lieu of director fees and other compensation paid to other non-employee directors. Mr. Szulik will receive an additional year's worth of cash compensation and vesting credit for any currently outstanding stock awards in the event that he does not continue to serve as a director on account of death, disability or failure to be re-nominated or re-elected.
Pursuant to the Transition Agreement, Mr. Szulik will be eligible for a cash incentive bonus for Fiscal 2008 in an amount determined as if he had remained an officer of the Company for the entire fiscal year. His outstanding equity awards will continue to be governed by the terms of the plan pursuant to which they were granted with the following adjustments: (1) the vesting of certain Performance Share Units ("PSUs") will no longer be based on the achievement of performance criteria but will instead be based solely on continued service with the Company using the Company's standard four-year vesting schedule currently in effect for grants of restricted stock to the Company's executive officers, and (2) upon a Change of Control (as defined in Mr. Szulik's employment agreement, dated as of July 24, 2002) while Mr. Szulik continues to serve as a member of the Board, all of Mr. Szulik's equity awards will immediately become vested.
If any amounts payable under the Chairman Agreement, Transition Agreement or any other amounts in the nature of compensation, result in the imposition of the "golden parachute" excise tax, Mr. Szulik will receive a tax gross-up payment to offset the tax liabilities created by the excise tax.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On March 27, 2008, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and fiscal years ended February 29, 2008 and February 28, 2007. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income and a reconciliation of GAAP cash flows from operating activities to non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R");
the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate; and
the impact of cash flow characterization of excess tax benefits from share-based arrangements under SFAS 123R.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and fiscal years ended February 29, 2008 and February 28, 2007 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards. The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $10.0 million and $36.5 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008 and $8.0 million and $32.4 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance. Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
During the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.9 million and $47.9 million, respectively, which reflected an annual effective tax rate of 38.4%. We currently have approximately $228.8 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008 of $2.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $6.5 million and $29.7 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.8 million and $6.1 million for these periods.
Our adoption of SFAS 123R also impacts the comparability of our cash flows from operating activities for periods subsequent to our adoption of SFAS 123R with our cash flows from operating activities for prior periods. SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award's original grant date fair value, the "excess tax benefits", be presented as a source of cash flows from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R, under the provisions of APB 25 we would have presented these excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards as a source of cash flows from operating activities.
In the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, we recognized $17.0 million and $61.3 million, respectively, of cash tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the share-based award's original grant date fair value. For improved comparability with prior periods, we have added these excess cash tax benefits to GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $54.5 million and $203.1 million, respectively, for these periods. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP cash flows from operating activities of $45.6 million and $201.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, was adjusted to reflect the addition of recognized excess cash tax benefits of $10.8 million and $16.0 million, respectively, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted cash flows from operating activities of $56.4 million and $217.5 million for these periods.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates for the foreseeable future. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2008 Results
Annual Revenue up 31% from Prior Year
Deferred Revenue up 40% from Prior Year
Repurchased $66 Million of its Common Stock
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008.
During the fourth quarter, I spent a significant amount of time meeting with customers, partners, employees and thought leaders from the open source community. The momentum of open source solutions is strong and growing, and we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our presence with existing customers and the many companies and industries that have only just begun to adopt open source solutions in a meaningful way, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. In addition, feedback I received supports why Red Hat has been rated the number one enterprise software vendor for value by Magazine for four consecutive years. As a result of these factors, we are optimistic about the growth outlook for the Linux market and Red Hat as we begin fiscal 2009.
CIO Insight
Total revenue for the quarter was $141.5 million, an increase of 27% from the year ago quarter and 5% from the prior quarter.

Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $42.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and tax expense as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $39.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior quarter.

"It was an outstanding year. Our annual revenue grew over 30%, our deferred revenue grew 40% and we produced operating cash flow margins of 50%. The companys performance was driven by growing demand for our open source solutions and the convincing value which we are able to demonstrate with our customers. We are also realizing returns on the increased investment which we have made over the past year in engineering, sales and marketing, combined with solid execution by our associates. stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat.

The annual base salaries for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
FY2009 Target Award Amounts under the EVCP
The target award amounts for FY2009 for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers under the EVCP, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
For a discussion of the EVCP, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 16, 2007.
FY2009 Performance Objectives under the EVCP
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives under the EVCP for each eligible participant are (a) a specified dollar amount of total revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flow from operations and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation charges under FAS 123R, for FY2009. The established operating margin financial performance objective is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
The Committee determined that 75% of a participant's target award amount under the EVCP will be based upon the financial performance objectives discussed above and 25% of a participant's bonus award under the EVCP will be based on individual performance objectives or achievement of goals, which may be objectively or subjectively determined (the "Individual Objectives"). Individual Objectives
relate to business/strategy planning and implementation, succession planning, retention of key employees, executive development and operational improvements. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance objectives discussed above will represent 25% of the financial component of the award, and, with respect to each financial metric and the individual performance objectives metric, payments range from 0  50% per metric.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that cumulative total shareholder return for the one- and three-year periods ending February 28, 2009 is negative, then the maximum payment shall not exceed 100% of the target award amount.

On May 22, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved a form of Performance Share Unit Agreement (the "FY09 PSU Agreement") for use with grants of performance share units ("PSUs") to executive officers under the Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended. Each PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in the FY09 PSU Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of the FY09 PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the FY09 PSU Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the FY09 PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 15, 2007. The summary of such terms in the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 15, 2007 is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the FY09 PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted a performance share unit award for a target number of PSUs ("Target PSUs"), and depending on the Company's financial performance, the executive may earn up to 200% of the Target PSUs (the "Maximum PSUs") over a performance period with three separate performance segments corresponding to three fiscal years of the Company (the "Performance Period"). Up to 25% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the first performance segment; up to 50% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the second performance segment, less the amount earned in the first performance segment; and up to 100% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the third performance segment, less the amount earned in the first and second performance segments.
The number of PSUs earned, according to the specified formula in the FY09 PSU Agreement, will be determined based on (i) a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth (the "Performance Goals") as compared to the performance of specified peer companies during each such year of the Performance Period with respect to the same Performance Goals and (ii) shareholder return for the one- and three-year periods corresponding to each of the three fiscal years that comprise the Performance Period.
The foregoing description of the terms of the FY09 PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Performance Share Unit Agreement Adopted May 2008 filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
 
See Exhibit Index attached hereto.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
This Agreement evidences the grant by Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), on the date set forth below (the "Grant Date") to the person named below (the "Participant") of a Performance Share Unit Award (the "Award") of the target number of performance share units listed below ("Target Performance Share Units") up to the maximum number of performance share units listed below ("Maximum Performance Share Units") for the Performance Period listed below (the "Performance Period"). Each unit ultimately earned (a "Performance Share Unit") represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, $.0001 par value per share ("Common Stock"), or the value of such Share. This Award is subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, (the "Plan") and in this Agreement, consisting of this Cover Sheet, the attached and thereto.
Exhibit A
Appendix A
 
 
By accepting this Award, the Participant hereby (i) acknowledges that a copy of the Plan and a copy of the Plan prospectus have been delivered to the Participant and additional copies thereof are available upon request from the Company's Equity Compensation Department and can also be accessed electronically, (ii) acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Cover Sheet, and and thereto (collectively, the "Agreement") and accepts the Award subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Agreement; (iii) represents that the Participant has read and understands the Plan, the Plan prospectus and the Agreement, and (iv) acknowledges that there are tax consequences related to the Award and that the Participant should consult a tax advisor to determine his or her actual tax consequences.
Exhibit A
Appendix A
The Participant must accept this Award electronically, within thirty (30) days following notification of the grant, pursuant to the online acceptance procedure established by the Company; otherwise, the Company may, in its sole discretion, rescind the Award in its entirety.
1. .
Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares". The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The overall Performance Period consists of three separate performance segments corresponding to the three fiscal years of the Company that end with the end of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during each of the segments are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the Company's financial performance as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goals set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goals, all as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goals are Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goals
(i) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the U.S. national exchange on which such stock principally trades for the 20 trading days ending on the last day of the Company's fiscal year (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to three decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan.
 
(ii) "Base Fiscal Year" for each member ("Peer") of the Peer Group and for the Company (each, an "Entity") means its full fiscal year that ends immediately before the beginning of the Performance Period;
(iii) "Operating Income" means operating income, excluding unusual or non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in applicable tax and accounting rules only (A) if and to the extent any such item is separately disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes and (B) in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, except as otherwise determined by the Committee;
(iv) "Measuring Year" means, for each Entity, its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the respective Company fiscal year for which performance goals are being measured within the Performance Period;
(v) "Percentage Operating Income Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Operating Income for such Entity's Measuring Year, and (y) Operating Income for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year, by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(vi) "Percentage Revenue Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Revenue for such Entity's Measuring Year and (y) Revenue for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Revenue" means gross revenue as such item is disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes.
The elements of each performance goal shall be as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussions and analysis, or other filings of the applicable Entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of Akamai Technologies, Autodesk, BEA Systems, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, Citrix Systems, Compuware, Jack Henry & Associates, McAfee, Micros Systems, Novell, Real Networks, Sybase, Tibco Software, Verisign and Wind River Systems. If any Peer ceases to be a public company during any Measuring Year (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a Peer for such Measuring Year and all remaining Measuring Years in the Performance Period. If any Peer fails to file its annual audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 16 following the end of any Measuring Year, it shall be treated as if it was not a Peer for such Measuring Year.
Peer Group
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of each Company Measuring Year in the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to each of the Performance Goals shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to each Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group and listed in descending order of Percentage Revenue Growth or Percentage Operating Income Growth, whichever is being measured for such
Determining Company Performance
 
Measuring Year (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for such Measuring Year plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 17). The percentile rank for each Performance Goal shall then be averaged, taking each into account equally (resulting in the "Average Percentile Rank").
(ii) . Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first Measuring Year in the Performance Period; up to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amount earned in the first Measuring Year); and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the third Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amounts earned in the first and second Measuring Years).
Maximum Performance Share Units Earned
(iii) . Subject to the limitation in Section 3(c)(iv), the number of earned Performance Share Units shall be calculated by multiplying (a) times (b), and that product times (c), and that product less (d), where (a) is the payout percentage as determined under the following table based on the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such Measuring Year, (b) is the maximum percentage of the Maximum Performance Share Units that may be earned as determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c)(ii) for the Measuring Year in question, (c) is the Number of Target Performance Share Units, and (d) is the number of Performance Share Units earned in prior Measuring Years. The number of Shares distributed will equal the number of Performance Share Units earned under this provision.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the Average Percentile Rank for each Measuring Year shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the Average Percentile Rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
(iv) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a negative shareholder return for the one- and three-year period ending with respect to a particular Measuring Year, then the maximum Payout Percentage determined under Section 3(c)(iii) shall not exceed 100%. For purposes of this limitation, a negative one-year shareholder return shall
Shareholder Return
 
exist if the difference between the Average Closing Price (i) for the Measuring Year, and (ii) for the Company's fiscal year ending immediately prior to the Measuring Year, is a negative number, and a negative three-year shareholder return will exist if the difference between the Average Closing Price (i) for the Measuring Year, and (ii) for the Company's fiscal year ending three years prior to the Measuring Year, is a negative number. Any cash dividend paid with respect to a Share in the Measuring Year which exceeds the cash dividend paid in the prior fiscal years measured under this subparagraph, will be added to the Average Closing Price (resulting in a deemed higher price) in each clause (i) in the preceding sentence.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section. The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
Continuous Service Relationship
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in ), the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essentials duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent
 
(80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, with respect to which the Performance Share Units were earned, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares
 
represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .
No Rights as Stockholder
Appendix A
10. . The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of Performance Share Units (and Restricted Stock) in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for such adjustments are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference.
Adjustments for Capital Changes

Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the
 
Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (of payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the
 
earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant hereby agrees that he is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of separation from service (as determined under Section 409A (the "New Payment Date")), except as Section 409A may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no
Section 409A
 
liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.
(h) . This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of the conflicts of laws thereof. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties, evidenced by this Award or the Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of North Carolina and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Wake County, North Carolina, or the federal courts for the United States for the Tenth District of North Carolina, and no other courts, where this Award is made and/or to be performed.
Governing Law/Choice of Venue
(i) . The Committee will have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules (including, but not limited to, the determination of whether or not any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) have been earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock)). All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith will be final and binding upon Participant, the Company and all other interested persons.
Administrator Authority
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control and provided the Participant's Business Relationship with the Company or Affiliate has not ceased, either (i) this Agreement will be continued, assumed, converted, or substituted for (consistent with paragraph (c) below) immediately following a Change in Control using restricted stock (the "Restricted Stock") of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation (the latter two terms as defined below) and subject to the vesting schedule in paragraph (b) below or (ii) all of the Shares underlying the Performance Share Unit award that have not previously been paid or earned shall be treated as earned (to the Target Performance Share Unit level) and shall be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control. The Committee shall determine the actions under this paragraph (a).
(b) The Restricted Stock shall become vested (measuring vesting years from the Grant Date of the Performance Share Units) in accordance with the following schedule if the Participant's Business Relationship continues (to the extent that the end of the applicable year in the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control):
 
If the Participant's employment with the Company or Affiliate is terminated by the Company without Good Cause, by the Participant for Good Reason, or by reason of the Participant's death or Disability within 12 months following such Change in Control, all of the Restricted Stock shall become fully vested on such termination.
(c) For purposes of this , this Agreement shall be considered to be continued, assumed, converted or substituted for:
Appendix A
(i) if there is no change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and the Change in Control does not result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction, and there are no changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that materially and adversely affect this Agreement; or
(ii) if there is a change in the number of such outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and/or the Change in Control does result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction:

Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On June 25, 2008, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended May 31, 2008. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); and
the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months ended May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $10.6 million and $8.4 million for the three months ended May 31, 2008 and May 31, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of  profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
During the three months ended May 31, 2008, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $11.1 million, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 39%. We currently have approximately $192 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5% through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for this period to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months ended May 31, 2008 of $1.9 million. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $10.8 million for the three months ended May 31, 2007, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.8 million for that period.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On September 24, 2008, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2008. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2008 and August 31, 2007. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); and
the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and six months ended August 31, 2008 and August 31, 2007,  include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $10.9 million and $21.4 million for the three and six months ended August 31, 2008, and $8.6 million and $17.0 million for the three and six months ended August 31, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of  profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
During the three months and six months ended August 31, 2008, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $13.5 million and $24.6 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 39.0%. We currently have approximately $145.2 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2008 of $2.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.1 million and $22.9 million for the three and six months ended August 31, 2007, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $1.9 million and $3.7 million for these periods.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Net income for the quarter was $21.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $18.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $43.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and tax expense as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $36.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $54.3 million, compared to $49.2 million from the year ago quarter and $63.4 million from the prior quarter.

On November 3, 2008, the Board of Directors of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") elected Micheline Chau and Jeff Clarke to serve on the Company's Board of Directors, effective immediately. A press release announcing the elections was issued on November 7, 2008, and is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Ms. Chau, currently the President and Chief Operating Officer of Lucasfilm Ltd., will be a Class I director with a term expiring in 2009. Mr. Clarke, currently the Chief Executive Officer and President of Travelport, Inc., will be a Class II director with a term expiring in 2010. Ms. Chau and Mr. Clarke have not yet been appointed to any committees of the Company's Board. The elections bring the size of Company's Board to nine members.
There are no arrangements or understandings pursuant to which Ms. Chau or Mr. Clarke was selected as a director.
In the ordinary course of business, Travelport, Inc. and Lucasfilm Ltd. and certain of their respective affiliates purchase goods and services from the Company from time to time. Since March 1, 2007, the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, Travelport and related entities have purchased goods and services from the Company amounting to approximately $1.25 million, and Lucasfilm and related entities have purchased goods and services from the Company that are de minimus in amount.
Ms. Chau and Mr. Clarke will be compensated under the Company's 2008 Independent Director Compensation Plan (the "2008 Director Compensation Plan"). Under the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, each will be eligible to receive an annual cash retainer of $50,000 for their service as a member of the Board. In addition, the 2008 Director Compensation Plan provides for the following annual cash retainers for service on committees of the Board: (i) $15,000 for service on the Audit Committee; (ii) $10,000 for service on the Compensation Committee; and (iii) $5,000 for service on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Under the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, directors may elect to receive all or a portion of any cash compensation in the form of the Company's deferred stock units ("DSUs"). DSUs represent the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock at a future date. The number of DSUs to be granted is determined by dividing the portion of the cash compensation with respect to which the election is made by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date the cash compensation is due to be paid. DSUs issued in lieu of cash compensation are fully vested upon issuance and will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock upon termination of service on the Board of Directors.
In connection with their election to the Board, Ms. Chau and Mr. Clarke will be granted, on the next regularly scheduled grant date for employees, a restricted stock award equal to a number of shares of the Company's common stock determined by dividing $300,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. These shares will vest equally over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant.
In addition to an initial equity grant, each of Ms. Chau and Mr. Clarke will be eligible to receive an annual equity award consisting of a restricted stock award for a number of shares of the Company's common stock determined by dividing $150,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. These shares of restricted stock shall vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. However, shares granted to Ms. Chau and Mr. Clarke in connection with their first annual equity award in 2009 will be prorated based on the number of months of service as of the grant date. Under the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, directors may also elect to receive DSUs on a one-for-one basis in lieu of annual equity awards. The DSUs will vest on the same basis as the restricted stock award and will be settled in shares of the Company's common stock upon termination of service on the Board of Directors.
The foregoing description of the terms of the 2008 Director Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, which was filed as Exhibit 10.42 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, and is incorporated herein by this reference.
The Company does not pay meeting fees. Non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board of Directors and meetings of any committees of the Board of Directors on which they serve.
Ms. Chau and Mr. Clarke each have entered into an indemnification agreement with the Company. In general, the indemnification agreements provide that the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, indemnify the indemnitee against expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement that may be incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of threatened, pending or completed proceedings to which the indemnitee becomes subject in connection with his or her service as director of the Company.
The indemnification agreements provide for indemnification rights regarding both third-party claims and proceedings brought by or in the right of the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by the indemnitee under certain circumstances. The indemnification agreements are not exclusive of any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which the indemnitee may be entitled, including any rights arising under the charter or bylaws of the Company, a separate agreement with the Company, or applicable law.
The foregoing summary of the indemnification agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Form of Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 28, 2007, and incorporated herein by this reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

On December 22, 2008, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2008. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008 and November 30, 2007,  include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $12.3 million and $33.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2008, and $9.5 million and $26.4 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of  profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.1 million and $12.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2008, and $3.3 million and $9.8 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2007, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
During the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $9.2 million and $33.8 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 35.0%. We currently have approximately $111 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2008 of $2.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.  In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.0 million and $34.9 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2007, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $2.3 million and $6.3 million for these periods.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method), the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates through at least the end of our fiscal year ending February 28, 2009. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Third Quarter Results
Revenue of $165.3 million, up 22% year over year and within guidance on a comparable currency basis
GAAP EPS of 12 cents, Non-GAAP EPS of 24 cents exceeds guidance
Operating Cash-flow of $59.1 million
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 22, 2008--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2009 third quarter ended November 30, 2008.
Total revenue for the quarter was $165.3 million, an increase of 22% from the year ago quarter and 1% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $135.5 million, up 17% year-over-year and flat sequentially.
Foreign exchange rate changes during the quarter, as compared to the second quarter, reduced quarterly revenues and expenses by $6.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, resulting in a negative impact on operating income of $2.1 million. For the quarter, GAAP operating income was $21.0 million, or a 12.7% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, non-GAAP operating income was $38.4 million, or a 23.2% operating margin, up 120 basis points from the prior quarter despite the strengthening US dollar and the Qumranet acquisition.
Net income for the quarter was $24.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with $20.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $48.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation, amortization and tax expense as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $42.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $59.1 million, compared to $59.6 million from the year ago quarter and $54.3 million from the prior quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $505.1 million, an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis and 2% sequentially. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of November 30, 2008 were $1.1 billion after retiring $285 million of convertible debentures and repurchasing 2 million shares of common stock.
Subsequent to these repurchases, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a new common stock repurchase program with a capacity of up to $250 million.
Our solid financial results this quarter reflect our strong market position as the low cost, high value provider of infrastructure solutions, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. Purchasing decisions for IT have changed dramatically for CIOs. In this budget-constrained environment, IT professionals are adopting open source and more specifically Red Hat to save money and enhance their competitiveness.
"This was a strong quarter where we delivered better-than-expected operating income, net income and cash flow, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. While significant devaluations in most foreign currencies depressed our reported revenue, a combination of focused cost management and natural currency hedging enabled the company to deliver better-than-expected operating margin.
We also took advantage of unusual market conditions and repurchased some of our convertible bonds and common stock. This action reduced the diluted shares outstanding by approximately 11 million, or 6%, and produced a gain of $4.1 million, both improving earnings per share. Our balance sheet remains very strong.
Other highlights include the following:
Red Hat announced an agreement with Fujitsu to provide new Linux support services that are designed to provide quicker response times and extended support periods for mission-critical systems through the Red Hat Advanced Mission Critical Program. The Program combines the mainframe expertise of Fujitsu with the enterprise Linux expertise of Red Hat.
Red Hat Chairman Matthew Szulik was named Ernst & Young's Overall National Winner for Entrepreneur of the Year 2008 Award.

Senior Management Severance Plan and Executive Agreements
On December 22, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "") approved a Senior Management Severance Plan (the ""), pursuant to which select Company employees, currently including all of the Company's named executive officers except its Chief Executive Officer, may become eligible to receive certain severance benefits. Participation in the Plan is limited to employees of the Company who:
Board
Company
Plan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent with the foregoing, each of the named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer, will be eligible to participate in the Plan upon the execution of an Executive Agreement with the Company upon terms materially consistent with those described above and in substantially the form of the Executive Agreement attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, which is incorporated herein by reference.
The Plan Administrator may within its discretion remove any Plan participant from participation in the Plan at any time but any such removal will be effective no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the date on which such action was taken. If any Plan participant is so removed from participation in the Plan during the term of his employment with the Company, he will cease to be bound by the post-employment covenants of non-solicitation and non-competition under his applicable Executive Agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, a Plan participant will be entitled to receive benefits under the Plan in the event that the Plan Administrator determines that:
 
 
 
A Plan participant qualifying for benefits under the Plan is entitled to receive the following benefits following termination of his employment with the Company:
 
 
 
 
The lump-sum payments generally will be paid within 75 days following the Plan participant's termination of employment, subject to delay in order to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, if the Plan participant does not execute the required release, he may be subject to recoupment by the Company for any incremental appreciation or gain obtained by exercising or disposing, or upon vesting, of portions of equity awards that vested after termination of his employment or that exercised during any extended exercise.
The foregoing summaries of the Plan and the form of Executive Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full texts of the Plan and the form of Executive Agreement, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
See Exhibit Index attached hereto.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
 
The purpose of this Senior Management Severance Plan (the "Plan") is to provide financial assistance to any Participant (as defined in Section II, below) whose employment with Red Hat, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (the "Company") is terminated under the circumstances described herein.
 
Selected Company employees shall be eligible to participate in this Plan (as a "Participant") as long as they meet the requirements to be a Participant in this Section II.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination for Good Cause shall not have occurred unless (i) the Company gives written notice to the Participant of the Company's intention to terminate the Participant's employment within sixty (60) days after the Board of Directors has knowledge that an event constituting Good Cause has occurred, specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Good Cause and (ii) there shall have been delivered to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board (excluding the Participant if the Participant is a member of the Board) at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Participant and the Participant is given an opportunity, together with legal counsel, to be heard before the Board) finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Participant has engaged the conduct described above and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a termination for Good Reason shall not have occurred unless the Participant gives written notice to the Company of the Participant's intention to terminate employment within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of the event constituting Good Reason, specifying in reasonable detail the circumstances constituting Good Reason, and the Company has failed within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to cure the circumstances constituting Good Reason and the Participant terminates employment within six (6) months of the end of such thirty (30) day period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Payment is due in cash or cash equivalents within ten (10) days after the Committee provides notice to a Participant that it is enforcing this Section. Any equity awards not already vested or exercised will then be immediately forfeited.
Payment will be calculated on a gross basis, without reduction for taxes or commissions. The Committee may, but is not required to, accept retransfer of shares in lieu of cash payments. This provision supplements and does not supersede the recoupment provision in Section 8(a) of the Agreement (relating to violations of restrictive covenants).
 
The Plan constitutes an unfunded severance benefits plan that is intended to be a welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), subject to Part 4 and 5 of Title I of ERISA.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may reduce the benefits under Section IV.A.1 (and the terms of Schedule A) by up to fifty percent (50%) without the foregoing twelve (12) month delay if the Committee determines that, as a result of a substantially adverse change in the Company's financial condition or in the results of the Company's operation (other than solely a decline in the price of the Company's common stock), it is in the Company's overall best interest to reduce the severance payments. The reduction can apply to any or all Participants. The Committee must make its determination in good faith and set out its conclusions and their basis in writing. Any reduction under this paragraph shall be treated as a reduction covered by Section 3(d) of the Agreement (relating to a reduction in the noncompetition period under the Agreement).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severance Payments (Section IV. A.1.)
The Severance Payment for any Participant under Section IV.A.1. shall equal the Participant's Base Salary
1
times the Multiplier.

"Non-compete Period"
(2) At the request of Executive, following a confidential consultation, the Company will provide its good faith view as to whether a proposed relationship Executive may wish to pursue appears likely to violate this Section, provided that such determination does not prevent the Company from proceeding under this provision if the services to be provided by Executive change, the product or service line at the Restricted Business becomes subject to this Section, or the information provided to the Company was incomplete or incorrect.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing portions of this Section 3, it shall not be a violation of this section for Executive to engage in the practice of law, either at a law firm or with another entity (as long as he or she satisfies his or her professional obligations to keep and not use the confidences and Confidential Information of the Company and as long as his or her employment does not include non-legal duties that may assist a Restricted Business in competing with the Company).

(3) The Non-Compete Period will not be reduced:
(i) under Section 3(d)(1) if the reduction in severance payment results in Executive's termination for Good Reason (because severance will then be based on the pre-reduction base salary) or if Executive agrees in writing to a reduction in base salary,
(ii) under Section 3(d)(2) if the reason for the reduced period is any generally applicable treatment under the relevant equity incentive plan in connection with a change in control or other corporate transaction (such as a general cashing out of the equity awards), or

Equitable and Other Remedies
 
agrees that he or she is subject to the recoupment provisions of Section V.D. of the Severance Plan. Section Executive acknowledges and agrees that the repayment and recoupment provisions in the two preceding sentences are not provisions for liquidated damages. Executive agrees that any breach of this Agreement is likely to cause the Company substantial and irrevocable damage that is difficult to measure and that money damages will be insufficient. Therefore, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, Executive agrees that the Company, in addition to such other remedies that may be available (including in this Section 8(a)), shall have the right to obtain an injunction from a court restraining such a breach or threatened breach and the right to specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to and cumulative with any other remedy that the Company may have at law or in equity.

In January 2004, Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") issued $600 million of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Debentures due 2024 (the "Debentures") pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, dated as of January 12, 2004, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as Trustee (the "Indenture"). The Debentures mature on January 15, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per annum, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The Debentures are senior unsecured obligations and are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 39.0753 shares per $1,000 of principal amount (which represents a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share), subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, in cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009. Holders of the Debentures may require the Company to redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, in cash on January 15 of 2009, 2014 and 2019. As a result of the Company's repurchase of Debentures pursuant to previously announced repurchase programs, approximately $285.5 million in principal amount of Debentures were outstanding at November 30, 2008.
As of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on January 14, 2009, the Company had received from holders of Debentures notices demanding the repurchase by the Company of approximately $285.0 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures. In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, on January 15, 2009, the Company paid to these holders a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of Debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest to the payment date. The Company paid the aggregate purchase price using cash on hand. Following this payment, there were $535,000 aggregate principal amount of Debentures that remained outstanding.
On January 21, 2009, the Company instructed the Trustee to give notice to the holders of the Debentures that the Company has elected to redeem on February 24, 2009 (the "Redemption Date") 100% of the aggregate principal amount of Debentures at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date, payable in cash (the "Redemption Price").
The Debentures may be converted at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on February 23, 2009, the business day preceding the Redemption Date. Holders who want to convert their Debentures must satisfy the requirements set forth in Article XII of the Indenture. As stated above, the conversion rate is 39.0753 shares per $1,000 of principal amount (which represents a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share).
The Debentures must be surrendered to the paying agent to collect the Redemption Price. The paying agent is U.S. Bank Trust N.A., U.S. Bank West Side Flats Operations Center, 60 Livingston Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota 55107.
The Indenture (to which the form of Debenture is attached) is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release issued by the Company on January 15, 2009, announcing the repurchase of $285.0 aggregate principal amount of Debentures is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
On January 15, 2009, the Company and Matthew J. Szulik, Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, mutually agreed to extend the term of his Non-Executive Chairman Agreement, dated as of February 28,
 
2008 (the "Chairman Agreement"), for an additional fiscal year. As extended, the term will expire on February 28, 2010, and may be further extended upon the mutual agreement of Mr. Szulik and the Company. In accordance with the terms of the Chairman Agreement, Mr. Szulik will be entitled to receive annual cash compensation of $250,000 per year in lieu of director fees and other compensation paid to other non-employee directors of the Company.
The Chairman Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On January 15, 2009, the Company, a Delaware corporation, amended and restated its bylaws (the ""). The following briefly describes the major changes to the Bylaws.
Bylaws
1. Section 1.1 was revised to permit the Chief Executive Officer, in addition to the Chairman, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "") and the President, to designate the place of stockholder meetings.
Board
2. Section 1.3 relating to special meetings of stockholders was revised to further clarify who can call a special meeting and what business can be conducted at a special meeting. The Section was also amended to explicitly state the ability of the Board to postpone or reschedule special meetings.
3. Section 1.6 and Section 1.7 (relating to quorum at stockholders' meetings and adjournment of stockholders' meetings) have been modified to provide that both the chairman and the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present are permitted to adjourn stockholders' meetings, whether or not a quorum is present at such meeting. Section 1.6 has also been revised to provide that the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting shall constitute a quorum (rather than a majority of the outstanding number of shares of capital stock, as previously provided).
4. Section 1.8 relating to voting and proxies was revised to delete references to stockholders acting by written consent given that the Company's Certificate of Incorporation (the "") does not permit stockholders to take action by written consent.
Charter
5. Section 1.9 relating to action at stockholders' meetings has been revised to provide that the vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the stock present or represented at the meeting is required for stockholder action (rather than a majority of the outstanding number of shares of capital stock, as previously provided).
6. Section 1.10 relating to the ability of a stockholder to introduce business and nominate directors at an annual meeting of stockholders was revised and expanded. Among other things:
 
 
 
7. Section 1.11 (related to stockholder action by written consent) was deleted in its entirety given that the Company's Charter already states that stockholders cannot act by written consent.
8. Section 4.2 relating to certificates of stock was revised and expanded. The changes clarify that the Company may issued uncertificated shares. Additionally, language has been included which tracks Section 151 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which sets forth requirements with respect to the form of certificated shares.
9. Section 4.3 relating to the transfer of shares was revised to clarify that transfers of the Company's stock shall be made only on the books of the Company and that the transfer of certificated shares may only be made upon the surrender of certificates representing such shares to the Company or its transfer agent.
10. Section 6.2 (relating to stockholder amendments of the Bylaws) was revised to provide that the vote of at least 75% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock is required to amend the Bylaws (rather than 75% of the outstanding number of shares of capital stock, as previously provided).
11. Section 7.5 relating to expense advance was revised to clarify that the advancement of expenses incurred in defending any pending or threatened legal proceedings must be advanced to both current and former directors and officers. Revisions have also been made to make the reimbursement of expenses mandatory, not just permissible.
12. Section 7.11 relating to continuation of indemnification was deleted and replaced with language that provides that the rights conferred upon directors and officers in Article VII vest at the time such individual becomes director or officer of the Company and that such rights are contract rights.
In addition, certain other changes were made to the Bylaws. The foregoing brief description is qualified by reference to the copy of the amended and restated bylaws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1, which are incorporated by reference herein. The attached Bylaws are marked to show changes made. A clean copy of the Bylaws will be posted to the Company's website at www.redhat.com under Corporate Governance.

7.1 ACTIONS OTHER THAN BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION.

'
'
 
believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
7.2 ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION.

'
'
7.3 SUCCESS ON THE MERITS. To the extent that any person referred to in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to therein, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

Such determination shall be made: (a) by the Board of Directors, by a majority vote of directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding (whether or not a quorum), or (b) if there are no disinterested directors or if a majority of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders.

Item 2.02.           Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 25, 2009, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2009 and February 29, 2008. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
        the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R");
        the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
        the impact of GAAP income tax expense, which includes an estimated annual effective tax rate versus our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2009 and February 29, 2008 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $14.6 million and $48.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009 and $10.0 million and $36.5 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.9 million and $17.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, and $3.1 million and $13.0 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
During the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, we recorded GAAP income tax expense of $9.0 million and $42.8 million, respectively, which reflected an estimated annual effective tax rate of 35.2%%. We currently have approximately $80.0 million of tax net operating loss carryforwards ("NOL") available, subject to restrictions, to offset future taxable income, resulting in an estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of approximately 5.0% for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009.  For this reason, in our non-GAAP presentation, we have adjusted the GAAP income tax expense for these periods to reflect the estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009 of $2.2 million and $9.4 million, respectively. In our reconciliation, the recorded GAAP income tax expense of $12.9 million and $47.9 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, was adjusted to reflect our estimated annual effective cash-basis tax rate of 5.0%, resulting in non-GAAP adjusted income tax expense of $2.4 million and $8.7 million for these periods.  
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) , the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and due to the availability of our tax NOL position to substantially offset cash costs of our GAAP effective tax rates.  Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2009 Results
Annual revenue of $653 million, up 25% from prior year
Full year GAAP EPS of $0.39, non-GAAP EPS of $0.86
Annual Operating Cash-flow of $236 million
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 25, 2009--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009.
Total revenue for the quarter was $166.2 million, an increase of 18% from the year ago quarter and 1% from the prior quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $139.4 million, up 14% year-over-year and 3% from the prior quarter. For the full year, total revenue was $652.6 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year, and subscription revenue was $541.2 million, up 20% year-over-year.
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2009 was $20.2 million and $82.5 million, respectively. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $39.8 million, or a 23.9% operating margin, up 70 basis points from the prior quarter and 180 basis points from the year ago quarter. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $148.4 million, an increase of 24% from the prior year.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $16.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $24.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $22.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $42.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation, amortization and tax expense as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $48.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $45.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Both the prior quarter and the year ago fourth quarter included one-time gains in other income of $4.1 million and $4.7 million respectively that are not included in the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter.
For the full year, GAAP net income was $78.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $76.7 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year was $178.1 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to $165.3 million and $0.77 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008.
Operating cash flow totaled $59.7 million for the quarter and $236.4 million for the full year. At year end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $543.1 million, an increase of 15% on a year-over-year basis and 8% sequentially. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of February 28, 2009 were $846.1 million after redeeming the remaining balance of $285.5 million of convertible debentures during the quarter.
Our ability to demonstrate real value and deliver cost savings to our customers enabled us to achieve significant new milestones during the quarter, including billings in excess of $200 million and more than 100 deals in excess of $250,000. Our value proposition is even more compelling in a challenging economic environment, and we believe thats a key driver to our solid financial results and market share gains, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. For the full fiscal year, we achieved an impressive combination of 25% revenue growth, 24% non-GAAP operating income growth and operating cash flow of $236 million, while renewing 100% of our top 25 customers up for renewal each quarter.
Solid execution by our associates and focused expense management on a continuing basis has enabled us to exceed our guidance for non-GAAP operating margins and EPS for the fourth quarter, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. We continue to enhance the companys already strong financial profile. We ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents and investments of $846 million and essentially no debt. During fiscal year 2009, we redeemed $570 million in convertible debt and repurchased 2.9 million shares of the companys common stock, which reduced our diluted share count by more than 10%. In summary, it was a strong year in a very difficult economic climate.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at . A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the live event has ended.

(e) On May 13, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company"):
 
 
 
 
 
Executive Base Salaries
The annual base salaries for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K"). Due to current economic conditions, the Committee decided to maintain base salaries at the levels paid during the Company's fiscal year ending February 28, 2009, until these conditions improve.
FY2010 Target Award Amounts under the EVCP
The target award amounts for FY2010 for the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers under the EVCP, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
For a discussion of the EVCP, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 16, 2007 (the "May 2007 Form 8-K").
FY2010 Performance Objectives under the EVCP
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives for FY2010 under the EVCP for each eligible participant are (a) a specified dollar amount of total revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flow from operations plus excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of expense related to share-based payment arrangements and the amortization of intangible assets. The established cash flow from operations and operating margin financial performance objectives are considered non-GAAP financial measures. The total revenue performance objective is based on assumed exchange rates for certain currencies and is subject to adjustment if actual rates differ from these assumed rates by five percent or more. In determining whether any financial objective has been satisfied for FY2010, the following items will be excluded: the impact of acquisitions and divestitures approved by the Company's Board of Directors, goodwill write-offs, restructuring charges, litigation and insurance settlement charges, the impact of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in tax laws or accounting procedures. The Committee reserves the right to exercise negative discretion to limit or forego any of these exclusions as it deems appropriate. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the May 2007 Form 8-K.
The Committee determined that 75% of a participant's target award amount will be based upon the financial performance objectives discussed above, and 25% of a participant's target award amount will be based on individual performance objectives or the achievement of individual goals, which may be objectively or subjectively determined (the "Individual Objectives"). Individual Objectives may relate to business strategy and implementation, succession planning, retention of key employees, executive development and operational improvements. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance objectives discussed above will be weighted equally to calculate the financial component of the award, and, with respect to each financial metric and the Individual Objectives metric, payments range from 0  50% per metric. The target award amounts as approved by the Committee are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K.
FY10 PSU Agreement
The FY10 PSU Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto, is intended for use with certain grants of PSUs to executive officers in FY2010. Each PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in the FY10 PSU Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of the FY10 PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the FY10 PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the FY10 PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2007 (the "October 2007 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the October 2007 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the FY10 PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted a performance share unit award for a target number of PSUs ("Target PSUs"), and depending on the Company's financial performance, the executive may earn up to 200% of the Target PSUs (the "Maximum PSUs") over a performance period with three separate performance segments corresponding to three fiscal years of the Company (the "Performance Period"). Up to 25% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the first performance segment; up to 50% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the second performance segment, less the amount earned in the first performance segment; and up to 100% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the third performance segment, less the aggregate amount earned in respect of the first and second performance segments.
The number of PSUs earned, according to the specified formula in the FY10 PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth (the "Performance Goals") as compared to the performance of specified peer companies during each such year of the Performance Period with respect to the same Performance Goals.
The foregoing description of the terms of the FY10 PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Performance Share Unit Agreement adopted by the Committee on May 13, 2009 filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Clawback Policy
The clawback policy generally requires any participant in the Company's EVCP who engages in an act of embezzlement, fraud, willful misconduct or breach of fiduciary duty that results in a material restatement of financial statements included in a filing by the Company with the SEC to repay to the Company (i) any portion of incentive compensation distributed during the twelve-month period following the filing with the SEC of any financial statements that are subsequently restated that is greater than the amount that would have been paid if calculated based on restated financial results and (ii) the net proceeds from gains on any sale of the Company's common stock distributed pursuant to incentive compensation arrangements during such twelve-month period. The foregoing description of the clawback policy does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the policy adopted by the Committee, which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

1. .
Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares". The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The overall Performance Period consists of three separate performance segments corresponding to the three fiscal years of the Company that end with the end of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during each of the segments are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the Company's financial performance as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goals set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goals, all as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goals are Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goals
(i) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the U.S. national exchange on which such stock principally trades for the 20 trading days ending on the last day of the Company's fiscal year (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to three decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan.
 
(ii) "Base Fiscal Year" for each member ("Peer") of the Peer Group and for the Company (each, an "Entity") means its full fiscal year that ends immediately before the beginning of the Performance Period;
(iii) "Operating Income" means operating income, excluding unusual or non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in applicable tax and accounting rules only (A) if and to the extent any such item is separately disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes and (B) in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, except as otherwise determined by the Committee;
(iv) "Measuring Year" means, for each Entity, its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the respective Company fiscal year for which performance goals are being measured within the Performance Period;
(v) "Percentage Operating Income Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Operating Income for such Entity's Measuring Year, and (y) Operating Income for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year, by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(vi) "Percentage Revenue Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Revenue for such Entity's Measuring Year and (y) Revenue for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Revenue" means gross revenue as such item is disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes.
The elements of each performance goal shall be as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussions and analysis, or other filings of the applicable Entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of Akamai Technologies, Autodesk, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, Citrix Systems, Compuware, Jack Henry & Associates, McAfee, Micros Systems, Novell, Progress Software, Real Networks, Sybase, Tibco Software, Verisign, VMWare, and Wind River Systems. If any Peer ceases to be a public company during any Measuring Year (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a Peer for such Measuring Year and all remaining Measuring Years in the Performance Period. If any Peer fails to file its annual audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 16 following the end of any Measuring Year, it shall be treated as if it was not a Peer for such Measuring Year.
Peer Group
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of each Company Measuring Year in the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to each of the Performance Goals shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to each Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group and listed in descending order of Percentage Revenue Growth or Percentage Operating Income Growth, whichever is being measured for such
Determining Company Performance
 
Measuring Year (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for such Measuring Year plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 17). The percentile rank for each Performance Goal shall then be averaged, taking each into account equally (resulting in the "Average Percentile Rank").
(ii) . Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first Measuring Year in the Performance Period; up to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amount earned in the first Measuring Year); and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the third Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amounts earned in the first and second Measuring Years).
Maximum Performance Share Units Earned
(iii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be calculated by multiplying (a) times (b), and that product times (c), and that product less (d), where (a) is the payout percentage as determined under the following table based on the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such Measuring Year, (b) is the maximum percentage of the Maximum Performance Share Units that may be earned as determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c)(ii) for the Measuring Year in question, (c) is the Number of Target Performance Share Units, and (d) is the number of Performance Share Units earned in prior Measuring Years. The number of Shares distributed will equal the number of Performance Share Units earned under this provision.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the Average Percentile Rank for each Measuring Year shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the Average Percentile Rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason
Continuous Service Relationship
 
prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section. The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in ), the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essentials duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the
 
later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, with respect to which the Performance Share Units were earned, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of
 
law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .
No Rights as Stockholder

12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any
 
notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (of payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.

Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On June 24, 2009, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $10.7 million and $10.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.0 million and $3.7 million for the three months ended May 31, 2009 and May 31, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets.  Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports First Quarter Results
Revenue of $174 million, up 11% from prior year
GAAP EPS of $0.10, non-GAAP EPS of $0.15; both up 25% from prior year
Repurchased $47 million of common stock
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 24, 2009--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2010 first quarter ended May 31, 2009.
Total revenue for the quarter was $174.4 million, an increase of 11% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $148.8 million, up 14% year-over-year.
We are pleased to report better than expected revenue and EPS results in Q1, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. Red Hats growth is driven in part by our ability to help enterprise customers save money in a challenging IT spending environment. Our open source solutions drive new capabilities, efficiencies and functionality into the mission critical infrastructure of our customers.
GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $25.1 million, or a 14.4% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $40.7 million, up 19% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.4%, up 160 basis points from the year ago quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $18.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with $17.3 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $28.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, as compared to $26.0 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $61.2 million, as compared to $63.4 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $567.3 million, an increase of 15% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of May 31, 2009 were $884.5 million.
While we remain focused on managing discretionary costs and improving efficiencies, we also continue to invest in growth opportunities in middleware, virtualization and cloud computing, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. These efforts combined with solid top line growth contributed to non-GAAP operating income growth of 19% year-over-year and healthy cash flow. In the quarter, we repurchased $47 million of common stock while strengthening our balance sheet with a 5% sequential increase in cash and investments. On a year-over-year basis, we have reduced our diluted shares outstanding by approximately 11%.
Other highlights include the following:
We announced our JBoss Open Choice strategy, which is intended to address the evolving needs of application developers and the changing market by embracing a variety of programming models, frameworks and languages. Executing on this strategy, Red Hat now has application platform solutions for common Java application workloads; from simple web applications, to light and rich Java applications, to Java Enterprise Edition (EE) based applications. Our new JBoss platforms support a variety of popular programming models including Spring Framework, Seam and Google Web Toolkit.

(e) On June 23, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company"):
 
 
The FY10 SPP PSU Agreement is intended for use with certain grants of SPP PSUs to executive officers in FY2010, including the grants of SPP PSUs approved by the Committee on June 23, 2009. Each SPP PSU represents the right to receive in the future shares of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such shares, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement.
Under the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of shares of the Company's common stock ("Target Shares"), and depending on the performance of the Company's common stock over a thirty-six month period beginning on March 26, 2009 (the "Performance Period"), the executive may earn up to 200% of the Target Shares. The number of shares earned, according to the formula specified in the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the performance of the Company's stock price relative to the performance of the stock price of specified peer companies during the Performance Period. This performance is measured by the change in the average price of common stock calculated over the ninety-day periods ending at both the beginning and the end of the Performance Period.
The Target Share amounts underlying the SPP PSUs granted to the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other named executive officers, as approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The executive will receive a single payout following the end of the Performance Period. Settlement of the SPP PSUs will be made within sixty days following the Committee's certification in writing of the number of SPP PSUs earned, but in no event later than the fifteenth day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, in which the end of the Performance Period falls. If the Company distributes shares to settle the SPP PSUs that are earned, it may withhold from the award a number of shares equal to the applicable withholding tax.
If an executive's continuous service to the Company or its affiliates as an employee, consultant or director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, subject to certain exceptions provided for in the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement and described in more detail below, then all unearned SPP PSUs will be forfeited.
If an executive's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the executive's death or Disability or by reason of the Company's termination of the executive without Good Cause, then the executive will be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the SPP PSUs earned for a shortened Performance Period ending upon the cessation of the Business Relationship.
Additionally, if a Change in Control occurs, and provided the executive's Business Relationship with the Company or its affiliates has not ceased, the Committee may determine that either (i) all of the shares underlying the SPP PSUs will be treated as earned based on the relative performance of the Company's common stock over a shortened Performance Period, ending on the date that the Change in Control occurs, using the price paid for the Company's common stock in the Change in Control transaction and will be paid out in a single lump sum within thirty days following the Change in Control, or (ii) the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement will be "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for", immediately following the Change in Control, using restricted stock of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation converted, as appropriate, using the price paid for the Company's common stock in the Change in Control transaction. The restricted stock will vest on the basis of time of service by the executive, with 25% of such stock being vested as of the first anniversary of the SPP PSU grant date, 50% as of the second anniversary, and 100% as of the third anniversary (to the extent that the end of the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control). If the executive's employment with the Company or an affiliate is terminated by the Company without Good Cause, by the executive for Good Reason or by reason of the executive's death or Disability within twelve months following such Change in Control, all of the restricted stock will become fully vested on such termination.
The foregoing description of the terms of the FY10 SPP PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of FY10 SPP PSU Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
 
See Exhibit Index attached hereto.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1

Each unit ultimately earned (a "Performance Share Unit") represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, $.0001 par value per share ("Common Stock"), or the value of such Share. This Award is subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Red Hat, Inc. 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, (the "Plan") and in this Agreement, consisting of this Cover Sheet, the attached and thereto.

Appendix A
 
By accepting this Award, the Participant hereby (i) acknowledges that a copy of the Plan and a copy of the Plan prospectus have been delivered to the Participant and additional copies thereof are available upon request from the Company's Equity Compensation Department and can also be accessed electronically, (ii) acknowledges receipt of a copy of this Cover Sheet, and and thereto (collectively, the "Agreement") and accepts the Award subject to all the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Agreement, (iii) represents that the Participant has read and understands the Plan, the Plan prospectus and the Agreement, and (iv) acknowledges that there are tax consequences related to the Award and that the Participant should consult a tax advisor to determine his or her actual tax consequences.
Exhibit A
Appendix A
The Participant must accept this Award electronically, within thirty (30) days following notification of the grant, pursuant to the online acceptance procedure established by the Company; otherwise, the Company may, in its sole discretion, rescind the Award in its entirety.
 
1. .
Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The Performance Period consists of one performance segment corresponding to the thirty-six month period that begins on the first day of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during the Performance Period are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention. The Performance Period will be shortened in the event of an intervening Acquisition or a cessation of employment, as provided for under the terms of this Agreement, including Appendix A.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the performance of the Company's common stock relative to the Peer Group (as defined below) as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goal set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goal, as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goal is Relative Share Price Performance. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goal
(i) "Acquisition" means an event that constitutes a Change in Control (as defined in ) under clauses B or C of that definition.
Appendix A
 
(ii) "Acquisition Price" means the per share equivalent on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise of all outstanding options, of the cash consideration and securities paid or payable to the Company or its equity owners at the closing of an Acquisition, with any securities that are not then publicly traded being valued by the Company's Board.
(iii) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on a U.S. national securities exchange on which such stock principally trades for each trading day during the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to two decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan; , , that if the Company has an Acquisition, the "Average Closing Price" means the Acquisition Price. For purposes of clarity, Average Closing Price is determined separately for each of the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period.
provided
however
(iv) "Entity" means each of (x) a member of the Peer Group and (y) the Company;
(v) "First Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the ninety-day period ending on the first day of the Performance Period;
(vi) "Relative Share Price Performance" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) the Average Closing Price during the Second Measurement Period (or, as applicable, the Acquisition Price) and (y) the Average Closing Price during the First Measurement Period by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Second Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the ninety-day period ending on the last day of the Performance Period.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of Akamai Technologies, Autodesk, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, Citrix Systems, Compuware, Jack Henry & Associates, McAfee, Micros Systems, Novell, Progress Software, Real Networks, Sybase, Tibco Software, Verisign, VMWare, and Wind River Systems. If any member of the Peer Group ceases to be a public company during the Performance Period (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a member of the Peer Group for the Performance Period.
Peer Group
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to the Performance Goal shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to the Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the
Determining Company Performance
 
Performance Goal for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 17).
(ii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be determined under the following table based on the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the percentile rank for the Performance Period shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the percentile rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . The Participant must be employed by the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") on the last day of the Performance Period, unless such Business Relationship ceases (i) due to death, Disability (as defined below) or termination without Good Cause (as defined in ) as provided for in this Section 4, or (ii) within twelve months following a Change in Control as provided for in Appendix A. If the Participant's Business Relationship ceases for any reason prior to the last day of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section 4 or . The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
Continuous Service Relationship
Appendix A
Appendix A
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of
Death or Disability
 
the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the termination), based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause, the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the termination), based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Cessation without Good Cause
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, in which falls the end of the Performance Period, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share
Appendix A
 
Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas.

6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
 
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .

Change in Control
Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by
 
withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is
Nature of Grant
 
unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.
14. .

Any payments described in this Section 14(g) that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant hereby agrees that he is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of separation from service (as determined under Section 409A (the "New Payment Date")), except as Section 409A may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.

Item 2.02.     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On September 23, 2009, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2008. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and six months ended August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2008 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $11.0 million and $21.7 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2009, and $10.9 million and $21.4 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.0 million and $10.0 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2009 and $3.9 million and $7.6 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Second Quarter Results
Revenue of $184 million, up 12% year-over-year
Deferred Revenue of $581 million, up 17% year-over-year
Repurchased $47 million, or 2.3 million shares, of common stock
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 23, 2009--Red Hat (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2010 second quarter ended August 31, 2009.
Total revenue for the quarter was $183.6 million, an increase of 12% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $156.3 million, up 15% year-over-year.
IT organizations continue to move ahead with purchases of high value solutions, and Red Hat is capitalizing on this demand as a result of our strong customer relationships and proven value proposition. These factors contributed to our better than expected total revenue in the second quarter, and drove annual subscription revenue growth of 15% for both the quarter and first half of fiscal year 2010. We continue to be optimistic about Red Hats future and believe the company is well positioned when the economic and IT spending environment improves, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. In addition to solid second quarter results, we also marked a new milestone in Red Hats ten year history as a public company by our inclusion in July as a component of the S&P 500.
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $27.5 million, up 29% from $21.4 million in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $43.6 million, up 21% year-over-year. GAAP operating margin was 15.0%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.7%, up 170 basis points from the year ago quarter.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $28.9 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared with $21.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $39.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, as compared to $30.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter include a discrete tax benefit of $7.3 million, adding approximately $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding this tax benefit, GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.11 and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.16.
Operating cash flow totaled $62.0 million compared to $54.3 million from the year ago quarter, up 14% year-over-year. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $580.9 million, an increase of 17% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of August 31, 2009 were $911.8 million.
During the second quarter, Red Hats financial performance was strong across all of our key metrics. We delivered double digit growth in revenue and deferred revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating margins and generated strong cash flow from operations, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. We are particularly pleased with the growth of the current portion of deferred revenue combined with the lengthening of our average subscription duration.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at . A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the live event has ended.

(d) Election of Director
On September 21, 2009, the Board of Directors of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") elected Donald H. Livingstone to serve on the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), effective immediately. A press release announcing the election was issued on September 25, 2009, and is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Mr. Livingstone, currently a teaching professor at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Business, will be a Class I director with a term expiring in 2012. His election brings the size of the Board to nine members. In addition to electing Mr. Livingstone as a director of the Company, the Board appointed him to the Board's Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
There are no arrangements or understandings pursuant to which Mr. Livingstone was selected as a director.
Mr. Livingstone will be compensated under the compensation plan currently in effect for the Company's independent directors, the 2008 Independent Director Compensation Plan (the "2008 Director Compensation Plan"). Under the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, he will be eligible to receive an annual cash retainer of $50,000 for his service as a member of the Board, an additional $15,000 annually for his service as a member of the Audit Committee and an additional $5,000 annually for his service as a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Under the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, a director may elect to receive all or a portion of any cash compensation in the form of the Company's deferred stock units ("DSUs"). DSUs represent the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock ("Shares") at a future date. The number of DSUs to be granted is determined by dividing the portion of the cash compensation with respect to which the election is made by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date the cash compensation is due to be paid. DSUs issued in lieu of cash compensation are fully vested upon issuance and will be settled in Shares upon termination of service on the Board.
In connection with his election to the Board, Mr. Livingstone will be granted, on the next regularly scheduled grant date for employees, a restricted stock award equal to a number of Shares determined by dividing $300,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. These shares of restricted stock will vest equally over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant.
In addition to an initial equity grant, Mr. Livingstone will be eligible to receive an annual equity award consisting of a restricted stock award for a number of Shares determined by dividing $150,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. These shares of restricted stock will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. However, Shares granted to Mr. Livingstone in connection with his first annual equity award in 2010 will be prorated based on the number of months of service as of the grant date. Under the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, directors may also elect to receive DSUs on a one-for-one basis in lieu of annual equity awards. The DSUs will vest on the same basis as the restricted stock award and will be settled in Shares upon termination of service on the Board.
The foregoing description of the terms of the 2008 Director Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the 2008 Director Compensation Plan, which was filed as Exhibit 10.42 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2008, and is incorporated herein by this reference.
The Company does not pay meeting fees. Non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board and meetings of any committees of the Board on which they serve.
Mr. Livingstone has entered into an indemnification agreement with the Company. In general, the indemnification agreement provides that the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, indemnify the indemnitee against expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement that may be incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of threatened, pending or completed proceedings to which the indemnitee becomes subject in connection with his service as a director of the Company.
The indemnification agreement provides for indemnification rights regarding both third-party claims and proceedings brought by or in the right of the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreement provides for the advancement of expenses incurred by the indemnitee under certain circumstances. The indemnification agreement is not exclusive of any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which the indemnitee may be entitled, including any rights arising under the charter or bylaws of the Company, a separate agreement with the Company, or applicable law.
The foregoing summary of the indemnification agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Form of Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 28, 2007, and incorporated herein by this reference.

On November 19, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board') of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved revisions to the Company's Stock Ownership Policy for its Chief Executive Officer, executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents who report directly to its Chief Executive Officer, and non-employee members of the Board, to be effective as of March 1, 2010. The revised policy is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by this reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Each non-employee director, the CEO and each executive vice president and senior vice president who reports directly to the CEO (each, a "covered individual") is required during the term of his or her service with Red Hat to either hold the applicable number of shares of Red Hat common stock set forth under the Stock Ownership Guidelines or comply with the Retention Requirement set forth below. This policy applies to shares of Red Hat common stock acquired under any Red Hat equity compensation plan. This stock ownership policy is administered and interpreted by the Compensation Committee of Red Hat's Board of Directors.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Ownership levels were established based on a multiple of the average annual base salary for the office held, in the case of executives, and a multiple of the annual cash retainer in the case of directors.
 
Retention Requirement
Unless the applicable guideline is satisfied, a covered individual is required to retain an amount equal to 50% of the net shares of Red Hat common stock realized from any equity awarded after the date of this policy.

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reaches Settlement in Restatement Class Action Litigation
- Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT) today announced that it has reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action lawsuit, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, brought on behalf of a class of shareholders in connection with the restatement of financial results announced in July 2004.

Red Hat plans to exclude this one-time charge from the non-GAAP results Red Hat reports for its quarter ended November 30, 2009, when these results are announced on December 22, 2009, and will provide a reconciliation to GAAP results at that time.
Raleigh, NC - December 15, 2009

Item 2.02.         Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 22, 2009, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2009. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2009 and November 30, 2008. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ("SFAS 123R");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of a charge recorded in connection with an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit (Civil Action No. 5:04-CV-473BR), pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, brought on behalf of a class of shareholders in connection with the restatement of our financial results announced in July 2004 (the Restatement Litigation).
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2009 and November 30, 2008, include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $12.6 million and $34.2 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2009, and $12.3 million and $33.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.0 million and $15.0 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2009, and $5.1 million and $12.7 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2008, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a reserve we recorded in connection with an agreement in principle to settle the Restatement Litigation.  This settlement is subject to the completion of a final, written settlement agreement and court approval.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP litigation settlement expense of $8.8 million for the three and nine months ended November 30, 2009.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of SFAS 123R in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method), the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the litigation settlement expense. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Third Quarter Results
Revenue of $194 million, up 18% year-over-year
Subscription Revenue of $164 million, up 21% year-over-year
Deferred Revenue of $619 million, up 23% year-over-year
Repurchased $52.3 million, or 1.9 million shares, of common stock
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 22, 2009--Red Hat (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2010 third quarter ended November 30, 2009.
Total revenue for the quarter was $194.3 million, an increase of 18% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $164.4 million, up 21% year-over-year.
Continued solid execution drove another quarter of strong results for Red Hat. Our double digit growth in the current economic environment was driven by our compelling value proposition and outstanding service. Our customer focus has clearly differentiated us from the competition. Red Hat was recently ranked as #1 among software vendors by IT executives for the fifth time in six years in the Ziff Davis CIO Insight Study, with the highest marks for reliability and value, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We also continued to introduce new products, including the November release of RHEV that advances our position in server virtualization and cloud computing. RHEV provides customers the choice of a high-value, low cost, open management solution that was not previously available in the $2 billion virtualization market.
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $19.8 million, including a previously announced charge of $8.8 million for a litigation settlement, compared to $21.0 million in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses and the charge for the litigation settlement as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $46.1 million, up 20% year-over-year. GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23.7%, up 50 basis points from the year ago quarter.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $16.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $24.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. The current quarter GAAP net income was reduced by $0.03 per diluted share due to the charge for the litigation settlement. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $33.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses and the charge for the litigation settlement as detailed in the tables below, as compared to $36.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $54.1 million, compared to $59.1 million from the year ago quarter. Due to record billings, accounts receivable increased $24 million compared to last year even as days sales outstanding (DSO) improved to 54 days compared to 59 days last year. At November 30, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $618.7 million, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of November 30, 2009 were $959.1 million after repurchasing $52.3 million, or 1.9 million shares, of common stock.
Strong bookings, particularly in North America, led to strong billings and greater than 20% growth in subscription revenue and deferred revenue, as well as further improvement of non-GAAP operating margins, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. This type of consistent performance, combined with our strong balance sheet, led to our third debt rating upgrade in 20 months by Standard and Poors rating agency.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at . A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the live event has ended.

Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") and Matthew Szulik have agreed to extend Mr. Szulik's term as chairman of the Company's Board of Directors ("Chairman") for an additional year, beginning on March 1, 2010 and ending on February 28, 2011, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement dated February 28, 2010 (the "FY11 Agreement"). Except as described below, the FY11 Agreement terminates the Non-Executive Chairman Agreement between Mr. Szulik and the Company, dated February 28, 2008 and amended on December 29, 2008 (the "Chairman's Agreement").
Pursuant to the FY11 Agreement, the Company will pay Mr. Szulik cash and equity compensation under the Company's compensation plan for non-employee directors. He will receive an annual cash retainer of $50,000 for his service as a member of the Board and an annual cash retainer of $40,000 for his service as Chairman. Additionally, Mr. Szulik will be eligible to receive an annual equity award consisting of a restricted stock award for a number of shares of the Company's common stock determined by dividing $175,000 by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant. These shares of restricted stock will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date.
Under the FY11 Agreement, the Company continues to be bound by Sections 4.4 and 5.2 of the Chairman's Agreement. Pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Chairman's Agreement, the Company is obligated to reimburse Mr. Szulik for the cost of health (medical and dental) insurance coverage obtained by Mr. Szulik for him and his dependents for a period of three (3) years following the date on which Mr. Szulik's service as a member of the Company's Board of Directors ceases for any reason. The reimbursement amount is capped at 200% of the then applicable COBRA premiums under the Company's group health plan, which in the Company's fiscal year ending February 28, 2010 was less than $30,000. Under Section 5.2 of the Chairman's Agreement, upon cessation of Mr. Szulik's service as a member of the Board as a result of death, disability or any reason other than removal for cause, his voluntary resignation or his notification of his intent not to stand for re-election, (i) his equity awards that would have vested had he continued to serve as a member of the Board through the remainder of his current term or over the 12 months following the date of cessation, whichever is longer, shall accelerate and be deemed vested and (ii) he shall be entitled to receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to the annual cash compensation he would have received had he continued as a member of the Board for the remainder of his applicable current term.
All other terms of the Chairman's Agreement, including the excise tax gross-up provision and monthly office allowance, were terminated by the FY11 Agreement.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 24, 2010, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2010. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2010 and February 28, 2009. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of a charge recorded in connection with an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit (Civil Action No. 5:04-CV-473BR), pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, brought on behalf of a class of shareholders in connection with the restatement of our financial results announced in July 2004 (the Restatement Litigation).
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and fiscal years ended February 28, 2010 and February 28, 2009 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for periods prior to adoption have not been restated. Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $14.0 million and $48.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2010, and $14.6 million and $48.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.6 million and $19.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2010, and $4.9 million and $17.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a reserve we recorded in connection with an agreement in principle to settle the Restatement Litigation.  This settlement is subject to the completion of a final, written settlement agreement and court approval.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP litigation settlement expense of $8.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2010.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of ASC 718 in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method), the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the litigation settlement expense.

Red Hat Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2010 Result
s
Annual revenue of $748 million, up 15% year-over-year
Annual subscription revenue of $639 million, up 18% year-over-year
Annual GAAP EPS of $0.45, up 15%; Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, up 20% year-over-year
Deferred Revenue of $646 million, up 19% year-over-year
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 24, 2010--Red Hat Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the worlds leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2010.
Total revenue for the quarter was $195.9 million, an increase of 18% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $169.2 million, up 21% year-over-year. For the full year, total revenue was $748.2 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year, and subscription revenue was $638.7 million, up 18% year-over-year.
With double digit revenue growth and record billings, our fourth quarter capped off a year of solid performance, moving us closer to our milestone revenue goal of a billion dollars, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. As we look forward, we believe that we are well positioned at the confluence of several major technology trends in the data center, including cloud computing, virtualization and middleware. Red Hats products directly address these trends and deliver innovative, cost-saving solutions to our customers that we expect will continue to drive our growth.
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2010 was $28.0 million and $100.3 million respectively. GAAP operating margin was 14.3% in the fourth quarter and 13.4% for the full year. After adjusting for stock compensation expense, amortization expense and the charge for our previously announced litigation settlement, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $46.6 million, or a 23.8% operating margin, and full year non-GAAP operating income was $177.0 million. Full year non-GAAP operating margin was 23.7%, an increase of 100 basis points from the prior year.
GAAP net income for the quarter was $23.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with $16.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $16.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the quarter was $36.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation expense and amortization expense, as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $33.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $28.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share in the year ago quarter.
For the full year, GAAP net income was $87.3 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with $78.7 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for stock compensation expense, amortization expense and the charge for our previously announced litigation settlement, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year was $138.1 million or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $121.5 million and $0.59 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2009.
GAAP operating cash flow totaled $77.9 million for the quarter and $255.2 million for the full year, after payment of $8.8 million for our previously announced litigation settlement. At year end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $645.9 million, an increase of 19% on a year-over-year basis and 4% sequentially. Cash and investments at February 28, 2010 totaled $970.2 million after repurchasing approximately $90.1 million, or 3.1 million shares, of common stock in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, Red Hat repurchased $236.4 million, or 10 million shares, of common stock. The diluted share count for the full year is 193.5 million shares, down 8.4% from the prior year.
This year has been about consistent execution in the most difficult economic conditions in our lifetime. We managed costs carefully while continuing to invest significantly. We added over 350 employees consistently throughout the year, principally in engineering and sales. We invested in sales training, systems and new equipment while holding the line on travel and other discretionary costs. As a result, we grew annual non-GAAP operating income by 19% and improved operating margin by 100 basis points for the full year, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. We have had consistently strong cash flow for some time, but the fourth quarter was exceptional with GAAP operating cash flow of $77.9 million, up 31% year-over-year, even after the one time litigation payment of $8.8 million.
Additional information on Red Hats reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hats results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hats investor relations website at .

On April 21, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, amended and restated the Company's by-laws (the "By-Laws"). The amendments adopted by the Board are summarized below.
Section 1.6 relating to a quorum at stockholders' meetings was revised to conform to New York Stock Exchange Rule 452 and Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 relating to broker discretionary voting, both of which were amended in 2009.
Section 1.9 relating to action taken at stockholders' meetings was revised to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality to a majority of votes cast. A director nominee in an uncontested election will be elected to the Board if the votes cast "for" a director exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections, the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast.
The foregoing summary is qualified by reference to the full text of the amended and restated by-laws attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1, which is incorporated by reference herein. The attached By-Laws are marked to show changes made. A clean copy of the By-Laws will be posted to the Company's website at under Company  Company Profile  Investor Relations  Corporate Governance.
www.redhat.com
In connection with the adoption of a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections, on April 21, 2010, the Board also amended and restated the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, adding a director resignation policy for uncontested elections. The director resignation policy in the Corporate Governance Guidelines provides that an incumbent director who fails to receive the required number of votes for re-election in accordance with the By-Laws will tender his or her written resignation for consideration by the Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The foregoing summary of the changes to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which is available at the Company's website at under Company  Company Profile  Investor Relations  Corporate Governance.

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.1 PLACE OF MEETINGS. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated from time to time by the Chairman of the Board (if any), the board of directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors"), the Chief Executive Officer or the President or, if not so designated, at the registered office of the Corporation.
1.2 ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on a date to be fixed by the Chairman of the Board (if any), Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President (which date shall not be a legal holiday in the place where the meeting is to be held) at the time and place to be fixed by the Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President and stated in the notice of the meeting.
1.3 SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time only by the Chairman of the Board (if any), a majority of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, and may not be called by any other person or persons. Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place, on such date and at such time as shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or the person calling the meeting. The Board of Directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting of stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.
1.4 NOTICE OF MEETINGS. Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notices of all meetings shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting. The notice of a special meeting shall state, in addition, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.
1.5 VOTING LIST. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
 
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time of the meeting, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
1.6 QUORUM. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, as such may be amended from time to time, or these Amended and Restated By-Laws, as such may be amended from time to time (the "Restated By-Laws"), the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum has been established for the purpose of conducting the meeting, a quorum shall be deemed to be present for the purpose of all votes to be conducted at such meeting, provided that where a separate vote by a class or classes, or series thereof, is required, a majority of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes, or series, present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
Shares held by brokers which such brokers are prohibited from voting (pursuant to their discretionary authority on behalf of beneficial owners of such shares who have not submitted a proxy with respect to such shares) on some or all of the matters before the stockholders, but which shares would otherwise be entitled to vote at the meeting ("Broker Non-Votes") shall be counted, for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, both (a) toward the total voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Corporation and (b) as being represented by proxy.
1.7 ADJOURNMENTS. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned to any other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may be held under these Restated By-Laws, whether or not a quorum exists, by a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, or by the chairman of the meeting. It shall not be necessary to notify any stockholder of any adjournment of less than 30 days if the date, time and place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken, unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting.
1.8 VOTING AND PROXIES. At any meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote at such meeting held of record by such stockholder and a proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by law. Each stockholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to vote or act for such stockholder by written proxy executed by such stockholder or his or her authorized agent or by a transmission permitted by law and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from the date of its execution, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section 1.8 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
In the election of directors, voting shall be by written ballot, and for any other action, voting need not be by ballot.
 
The Corporation may, and to the extent required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting and make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at such meeting may, and to the extent required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, shall, appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.
1.9 ACTION AT MEETING. When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock present or represented and voting on a matter (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in the case of each such class, the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock of that class present or represented and voting on such matter) shall decide any matter to be voted upon by the stockholders at such meeting (other than the election of directors), except when a different vote is required by express provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Restated By-Laws.
Any election of directors by the stockholders shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at such election, except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation. For the purposes of this paragraph, Broker Non-Votes represented at the meeting but not permitted to vote on a particular matter shall not be counted, with respect to the vote on such matter, in the number of (a) votes cast, (b) votes cast affirmatively, or (c) votes cast negatively.
At all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director nominee; provided, however, that if, as of a date that is five (5) business days in advance of the date that the Corporation files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors (not exceeding the authorized number of directors as fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation) shall be elected by a plurality of the voting power of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this Section 1.9, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for' a director must exceed the number of shares voted against' that director. If, for any cause, the entire Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Restated By-Laws.

(1) The material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum;

7.1 ACTIONS OTHER THAN BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity, against all liability, losses, expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
 
7.2 ACTIONS BY OR IN THE RIGHT OF THE CORPORATION. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.
7.3 SUCCESS ON THE MERITS. To the extent that any person referred to in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to therein, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.
7.4 AUTHORIZATION. Any indemnification under Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2. Such determination shall be made: (a) by the Board of Directors, by a majority vote of directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding (whether or not a quorum), or (b) if there are no disinterested directors or if a majority of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular legal counsel to the corporation) in a written opinion, or (c) by the stockholders.
7.5 EXPENSE ADVANCE. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a current or former officer or director of the Corporation (regardless if such expenses were incurred in such person's capacity as an officer or director of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation and at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity) in defending any pending or threatened civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such officer or director to repay such amount, if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by other employees or agents of the Corporation may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.
 
7.6 NONEXCLUSIVITY. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
7.7 INSURANCE. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity against any liability asserted against and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article or Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
7.8 "THE CORPORATION." For the purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" shall include the resulting corporation and, to the extent that the Board of Directors of the resulting corporation so decides, all constituent corporations (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such a constituent corporation or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.
7.9 OTHER INDEMNIFICATION. The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity shall be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or non-profit entity or from insurance.
7.10 OTHER DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Article, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article.
 
7.11 CONTINUATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. The rights conferred upon directors, trustees, partners, officers, employees or agents in this Article VII shall vest at the time an individual becomes a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent and shall be contract rights. Such rights shall continue as to a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent who has ceased to be a director, trustee, partner, officer, employee or agent and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of such director's, trustee's, partner's, officer's, employee's and agent's heirs, personal representatives and estate. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VII that adversely affects any right of directors, trustees, partners, officers, employees and agents shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any action, suit or proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.

(e) On May 19, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company"):
 
 
 
 
 
 
Executive Base Salaries
The annual base salaries for the Executive Officers approved by the Committee are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K").
FY2011 Target Award Amounts under the EVCP
The target award amounts under the EVCP for FY2011 for the Executive Officers, approved by the Committee are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 16, 2007 (the "May 2007 Form 8-K").
FY2011 Financial Performance Objectives under the EVCP
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives for FY2011 under the EVCP are (a) a specified dollar amount of total revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flow from operations plus excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of expense related to share-based payment arrangements and the amortization of intangible assets. The cash flow from operations and operating margin performance objectives are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
The total revenues and operating margin performance objectives are based on assumed exchange rates of 1.00 Euro:U.S.$1.35 and 90 yen:U.S.$1.00, and these objectives are subject to adjustment if actual exchange rates for these currencies differ from these assumed rates by 5% or more. Additionally, the following items will be excluded in determining whether any financial performance objective has been satisfied for FY2011: the impact of acquisitions and divestitures approved by the Board of Directors, goodwill write-offs, restructuring charges, litigation and insurance settlement charges, the impact of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in tax laws or accounting procedures. The Committee has reserved the right to exercise negative discretion to limit or forego any of these exclusions and may adjust any financial performance objective for FY2011 in its discretion as permitted by the EVCP. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the May 2007 Form 8-K.
The Committee determined that 75% of a participant's target award amount will be based upon the financial performance objectives discussed above, and 25% of a participant's target award amount will be based on individual performance objectives, which may be objectively or subjectively determined (the "Individual Objectives"). Individual Objectives relate to strategy development, planning and/or implementation, corporate initiatives, succession planning, retention of key employees, executive development and operational improvements. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance
objectives discussed above will be weighted equally in calculating the financial component of the award, and, with respect to each financial metric and the Individual Objectives metric, payments range from 0  50% per metric. The target award amounts approved by the Committee for the Executive Officers are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K.
FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement
The FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto, is intended for use with certain grants of PSUs to Executive Officers in FY2011. Each PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2007 (the "October 2007 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the October 2007 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of PSUs, and depending on the Company's financial performance, the executive may earn up to 200% of the target number of PSUs (the "Maximum PSUs") over a performance period with three separate performance segments corresponding to three fiscal years of the Company (the "Operating Performance Period"). Up to 25% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the first performance segment; up to 50% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the second performance segment, less the amount earned in the first performance segment; and up to 100% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the third performance segment, less the amount earned in the first and second performance segments.
The number of PSUs earned, according to the formula specified in the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Operating Performance Period with respect to Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth (the "Operating Performance Goals") as compared to the performance of specified peer companies during each such year of the Operating Performance Period with respect to the same Operating Performance Goals.
If a Change in Control occurs, and provided the executive's continuous service with the Company or any of its affiliates as an employee, consultant or director (a "Business Relationship") has not ceased, the Committee may determine that either (i) all of the shares underlying the award that have not previously been paid or earned will be treated as earned (x) to the Target Performance Share Unit level if the Change in Control occurs during the first or second Measuring Year or (y) based on the Company's performance as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date that the Change in Control occurs if the Change in Control occurs during the third Measuring Year, and will be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control or (ii) the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement will be "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for" immediately following a Change in Control, using restricted stock of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation.
The foregoing description of the terms of the FY2011 Operating Performance PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Operating Performance Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement
The FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto, is intended for use with certain grants of PSUs to Executive Officers in FY2011. Each PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement (Fiscal Year 2010  SPP Form) filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2009 (the "June 2009 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the June 2009 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of PSUs, and depending on the performance of the Company's common stock over a thirty-six month period beginning on March 1, 2010 (the "Share Price Performance Period"), the executive may earn up to 200% of the target number of PSUs. The number of PSUs earned, according to the formula specified in the FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the performance of the Company's stock price relative to the performance of the stock price of specified peer companies during the Share Price Performance Period. This performance is measured by the change in the average price of common stock calculated over the ninety-day periods ending at both the beginning and the end of the Share Price Performance Period.
The foregoing description of the terms of the FY2011 Share Price Performance PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Share Price Performance Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Performance RSA Agreement
The Performance RSA Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.4 hereto, is intended for use with grants of restricted stock awards ("RSAs") to Executive Officers in FY2011. Under the Performance RSA Agreement, executives are awarded shares of the Company's common stock subject to achievement of a specified dollar amount of total revenues established by the Committee as the performance objective for FY2011 under the EVCP (the "RSA Performance Goal"). If the Company fails to achieve the RSA Performance Goal for FY2011, then all shares of restricted stock subject to the award are forfeited. If the Company achieves the RSA Performance Goal for FY2011, 25% of the restricted stock vests on July 16, 2011, and the remainder vests ratably on a quarterly basis over the course of the subsequent threeyear period, provided that the executive's Business Relationship with the Company has not ceased. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the Performance RSA Agreement.
If a Change in Control occurs, and the Performance RSA Agreement is "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for" and within one year of the Change in Control, the executive's Business Relationship is terminated by the Company or its successor without Good Cause or by the executive for Good Reason, all of the restricted stock vests. If a Change in Controls occurs, and the Performance RSA Agreement is not "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for" immediately following the Change in Control, all of the restricted stock shall be treated as vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. In the event that the Change in Control occurs prior to the Vesting Start Date, then the RSA Performance Goal shall be deemed to have been achieved.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Performance RSA Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Performance RSA Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.4 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares". The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The overall Performance Period consists of three separate performance segments corresponding to the three fiscal years of the Company that end with the end of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during each of the segments are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the Company's financial performance as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goals set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goals, all as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goals are Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goals
(i) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the U.S. national exchange on which such stock principally trades for the 20 trading days ending on the last day of the Company's fiscal year (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to three decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan.
 
(ii) "Base Fiscal Year" for each member ("Peer") of the Peer Group and for the Company (each, an "Entity") means its full fiscal year that ends immediately before the beginning of the Performance Period;
(iii) "Operating Income" means operating income, excluding unusual or non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in applicable tax and accounting rules only (A) if and to the extent any such item is separately disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes and (B) in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, except as otherwise determined by the Committee;
(iv) "Measuring Year" means, for each Entity, its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the respective Company fiscal year for which performance goals are being measured within the Performance Period;
(v) "Percentage Operating Income Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Operating Income for such Entity's Measuring Year, and (y) Operating Income for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year, by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(vi) "Percentage Revenue Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Revenue for such Entity's Measuring Year and (y) Revenue for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Revenue" means gross revenue as such item is disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes.
The elements of each performance goal shall be as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussions and analysis, or other filings of the applicable Entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Peer Group consists of each of Akamai Technologies, Ansys, Inc., Autodesk, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, Citrix Systems, Compuware, Jack Henry & Associates, McAfee, Micros Systems, Novell, Progress Software, Real Networks, salesforce.com, Tibco Software, Verisign, and VMWare. If any Peer ceases to be a public company during any Measuring Year (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a Peer for such Measuring Year and all remaining Measuring Years in the Performance Period. If any Peer fails to file its annual audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 16 following the end of any Measuring Year, it shall be treated as if it was not a Peer for such Measuring Year.

(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of each Company Measuring Year in the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to each of the Performance Goals shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to each Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group and listed in descending order of Percentage Revenue
Determining Company Performance
 
Growth or Percentage Operating Income Growth, whichever is being measured for such Measuring Year (e.g., if the Company
(ii) ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for such Measuring Year plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 17). The percentile rank for each Performance Goal shall then be averaged, taking each into account equally (resulting in the "Average Percentile Rank").
(iii) . Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first Measuring Year in the Performance Period; up to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amount earned in the first Measuring Year); and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the third Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amounts earned in the first and second Measuring Years).
Maximum Performance Share Units Earned
(iv) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be calculated by multiplying (a) times (b), and that product times (c), and that product less (d), where (a) is the payout percentage as determined under the following table based on the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such Measuring Year, (b) is the maximum percentage of the Maximum Performance Share Units that may be earned as determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c)(ii) for the Measuring Year in question, (c) is the Number of Target Performance Share Units, and (d) is the number of Performance Share Units earned in prior Measuring Years. The number of Shares distributed will equal the number of Performance Share Units earned under this provision.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the Average Percentile Rank for each Measuring Year shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the Average Percentile Rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
 
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section. The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
Continuous Service Relationship
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in ), the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
 
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, with respect to which the Performance Share Units were earned, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
 
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .
No Rights as Stockholder

Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding
 
obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal,
 
state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Participant's Acceptance
(g) . This Agreement, the Performance Share Units and payments made pursuant to this Agreement are intended to comply with or qualify for an exemption from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") and shall be construed consistently therewith and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with that intention. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend the Plan and/or this Agreement to ensure that all Performance Share Units are awarded in a manner that qualifies for exemption from or complies with Section 409A, provided, however, that the Company makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to this Award of Performance Share Units. Any payments described in this Section 14(g) that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant hereby agrees that he is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of separation from service (as determined under Section 409A (the "New Payment Date")), except as Section 409A may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.

Administrator Authority
 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of a Change in Control and provided the Participant's Business Relationship with the Company or Affiliate has not ceased, either (i) this Agreement will be continued, assumed, converted, or substituted for (consistent with paragraph (c) below) immediately following a Change in Control using restricted stock (the "Restricted Stock") of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation (the latter two terms as defined below) and subject to the vesting schedule in paragraph (b) below or (ii) all of the Shares underlying the Performance Share Unit award that have not previously been paid or earned shall be treated as earned according to the next sentence and shall be paid out in a single lump sum within 45 days following the Change in Control. Any conversion under clause (i) or determination of earned Performance Share Units under clause (ii) shall be at the Target Performance Share Unit level if the Change in Control occurs in the first or second Measuring Year and at the Actual Performance Share Unit Level (as defined below) if the Change in Control occurs in the third Measuring Year. "Actual Performance Share Unit Level" means the number of Performance Share Units that would have been earned (if any) if the third Measuring Year had ended on the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date that the Change in Control occurred. The Committee shall determine the actions under this paragraph (a).
(b) The Restricted Stock shall become vested (measuring vesting years from the Grant Date of the Performance Share Units) in accordance with the following schedule if the Participant's Business Relationship continues (to the extent that the end of the applicable year in the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control):
 
If the Participant's employment with the Company or Affiliate is terminated by the Company without Good Cause, by the Participant for Good Reason, or by reason of the Participant's death or Disability within 12 months following such Change in Control, all of the Restricted Stock shall become fully vested on such termination.
(c) For purposes of this , this Agreement shall be considered to be continued, assumed, converted or substituted for:

(ii) if there is a change in the number of such outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and/or the Change in Control does result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction:
 
 
 
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the assigned meanings:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any person acquires beneficial ownership of more than 35% of the Company Voting Securities as a result of the acquisition of Company Voting Securities by the Company which reduces the number of Company Voting Securities outstanding; , if after such acquisition by the Company such person becomes the beneficial owner of additional Company Voting Securities that increases the percentage of outstanding Company Voting Securities beneficially owned by such person, a Change in Control of the Company shall then occur.

The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The Performance Period consists of one performance segment corresponding to the thirty-six month period that begins on the first day of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during the Performance Period are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention. The Performance Period will be shortened in the event of an intervening Acquisition or a cessation of employment, as provided for under the terms of this Agreement, including Appendix A.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the performance of the Company's common stock relative to the Peer Group (as defined below) as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goal set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goal, as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goal is Relative Share Price Performance. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goal
(i) "Acquisition" means an event that constitutes a Change in Control (as defined in ) under clauses B or C of that definition.
Appendix A
 
(ii) "Acquisition Price" means the per share equivalent on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise of all outstanding options, of the cash consideration and securities paid or payable to the Company or its equity owners at the closing of an Acquisition, with any securities that are not then publicly traded being valued by the Company's Board.
(iii) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on a U.S. national securities exchange on which such stock principally trades for each trading day during the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to two decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan; , , that if the Company has an Acquisition, the "Average Closing Price" means the Acquisition Price. For purposes of clarity, Average Closing Price is determined separately for each of the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period.
provided
however
(iv) "Entity" means each of (x) a member of the Peer Group and (y) the Company;
(v) "First Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the ninety-day period ending on the first day of the Performance Period;
(vi) "Relative Share Price Performance" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) the Average Closing Price during the Second Measurement Period (or, as applicable, the Acquisition Price) and (y) the Average Closing Price during the First Measurement Period by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Second Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the ninety-day period ending on the last day of the Performance Period.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of Akamai Technologies, Ansys, Inc., Autodesk, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, Citrix Systems, Compuware, Jack Henry & Associates, McAfee, Micros Systems, Novell, Progress Software, Real Networks, salesforce.com, Tibco Software, Verisign, and VMWare. If any member of the Peer Group ceases to be a public company during the Performance Period (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a member of the Peer Group for the Performance Period.
Peer Group
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to the Performance Goal shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to the Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the
Determining Company Performance
 
Performance Goal for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 17).
(ii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be determined under the following table based on the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the percentile rank for the Performance Period shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the percentile rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.

The Participant must be employed by the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") on the last day of the Performance Period, unless such Business Relationship ceases (i) due to death, Disability (as defined below) or termination without Good Cause (as defined in ) as provided for in this Section 4, or (ii) within twelve months following a Change in Control as provided for in Appendix A. If the Participant's Business Relationship ceases for any reason prior to the last day of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section 4 or . The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.

Appendix A
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of
Death or Disability
 
the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the termination), based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause, the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the termination), based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Cessation without Good Cause
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.

th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, in which falls the end of the Performance Period, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share
Appendix A
 
Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas.

Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship

The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .

Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by
 
withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is
Nature of Grant
 
unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.

If the Performance Goal for the Performance Period is not achieved, all of the shares of Restricted Stock will be forfeited and this Agreement shall be terminated. If the Participant's Business Relationship is terminated for any reason, the shares of Restricted Stock that were not vested on the date of such termination will be forfeited. The shares of Restricted Stock that are forfeited will be cancelled and returned to the Company. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship shall not be considered as having terminated during any leave of absence if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company; in the event of such leave of absence, vesting of the Restricted Stock shall be suspended (and the period of the leave of absence shall be added to all vesting dates) unless otherwise determined by the Company. The vesting of the Restricted Stock shall not be affected by any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Subsidiaries or Affiliates so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.

When the Restricted Stock vests, the Company shall redeliver to the Participant (or the Participant's legal representatives, beneficiaries or heirs) from the shares of Restricted Stock deposited with it the number of shares which have then vested. The Participant agrees that any resale of the shares of Restricted Stock received upon vesting shall be made in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or an applicable exemption therefrom, including without limitation the exemption provided by Rule 144 promulgated thereunder (or any successor rule).
. Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Restricted Stock imposes any obligation on the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to have a Business Relationship with the Participant.
5. No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship

At the discretion of the Company, the Tax Amount may be withheld in cash from such wages or from other remuneration, or in kind from the shares or other property otherwise deliverable to the Participant on vesting of this Restricted Stock. The Participant has reviewed with the Participant's own tax advisors the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
9. Withholding

The Participant understands that the Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Participant's own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Participant understands that it may be beneficial in many circumstances to elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Stock is granted rather than when and as the Restricted Stock vests by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within 30 days from the date of grant.
. The Participant agrees that in the event that the Company effects an underwritten public offering of Shares registered under the Securities Act, the Restricted Stock may not be sold, offered for sale or otherwise disposed of, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the managing underwriter(s) of the offering, for such period of time after the execution of an underwriting agreement in connection with such offering that all of the Company's then directors and executive officers agree to be similarly bound.

Governing Law
 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if (i) this grant of Restricted Stock is continued, assumed, converted or substituted for immediately following the Change in Control and (ii) within one year after a Change in Control the Participant's Business Relationship is terminated by the Company or its successor without Good Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, all of the Restricted Stock shall be vested. Furthermore and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if this grant of Restricted Stock is not continued, assumed, converted or substituted for immediately following the Change in Control, all of the Restricted Stock shall be treated as vested immediately prior to the Change in Control. For purposes of applying the two preceding sentences, in the event that the Change in Control occurs prior to the Vesting Start Date, then the Performance Goal in Section 2 shall be deemed to have been achieved. This grant of Restricted Stock shall be considered to be continued, assumed, converted or substituted for:
(A) if there is no change in the number of outstanding Shares and the Change in Control does not result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction and there are no changes to the terms and conditions of this grant that materially and adversely affect this grant; or
(B) if there is a change in the number of outstanding Shares and/or the Change in Control does result from the consummation of a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, reorganization or similar form of corporate transaction:

(b)              On May 20, 2010, Matthew J. Szulik notified Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") that he will not stand for re-election as a director of the Company in order to devote more time to his family and personal interests outside of the Company. Mr. Szulik will serve the remainder of his term as a director and Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"), and his resignation is effective August 12, 2010, the scheduled date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Szulik has informed the Company that his resignation is not the result of a disagreement with the Company on any matter.
A copy of the letter of resignation sent by Mr. Szulik to the Board is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

99.1    Letter of Resignation from Matthew J. Szulik dated May 20, 2010

Exhibit 99.1
Board of Directors
Red Hat, Inc.
1801 Varsity Drive
Raleigh, NC 27606
Attn: General H. Hugh Shelton, Lead Director
Members of the Board,
This letter is to inform you that I do not intend to stand for re-election to the Board of Directors of Red Hat when my term ends in August. Please let this letter serve as my resignation from the Board as of August 12, 2010, the date of our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. I have had the honor of participating in Red Hat's growth from a start-up company through its current status as an S&P 500 corporation that is the world's leading provider of open source solutions. Throughout my ten-plus years with Red Hat, I have enjoyed the opportunity to work with the many talented and dedicated individuals who have helped make Red Hat what it is today, including my fellow board members and the Red Hat employees, past and present, who believed enough in the possibilities of the open source way to make Red Hat a success. However, I am at stage in my life when I would like to have more time and energy available to devote to my family and some of my personal interests outside of Red Hat. My decision is not, of course, the result of any disagreement with or concerns about Red Hat, the Board or company management on any matters.
It is hard for me to make this decision, but I know that I will leave the Company strong in its position, proud of my contributions to its success, confident in the abilities of Jim, our CEO, and the rest of my fellow board members to guide Red Hat into the future and excited to see what new developments Red Hat employees have in store for us in the years to come.
Regards,
/s/ Matthew
Matthew J. Szulik

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
         On June 22, 2010, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2010. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
         We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
         Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
         Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months ended May 31, 2010 and May 31, 2009 include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for periods prior to adoption have not been restated. Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $13.2 million and $10.7 million for the three months ended May 31, 2010, and May 31, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
         We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.5 million and $5.0 million for the three months ended May 31, 2010, and May 31, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
         Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of ASC 718 in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.
         The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports First Quarter Results
Revenue of $209 million, up 20% from prior year
GAAP EPS of $0.12, non-GAAP EPS of $0.18, both up 20% from the prior year
Repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 22, 2010--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2011 first quarter ended May 31, 2010.
Total revenue for the quarter was $209.1 million, an increase of 20% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $179.1 million, up 20% year-over-year.
We had a strong start to our fiscal year with 20% organic revenue growth and 28% non-GAAP operating income growth, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We executed well and achieved a significant increase in the number of large deals booked year-over- year, including several with an initial consulting component which we believe is a positive indicator of new project spending and future subscription billings.
GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $34.2 million, or a 16.4% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $52.0 million, up 28% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, up 140 basis points from the year ago quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $24.1 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with $18.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $35.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, as compared to $28.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow totaled $60.6 million, as compared to $61.2 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $625.6 million, an increase of 10% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of May 31, 2010 was $967.8 million.
Our business was strong with healthy subscription renewals, large deals, continued progress in our free to paid initiative and strong growth in our services business. We continued to invest in our growth, in both engineering and sales, and it is paying off. Despite significant foreign currency volatility, both revenue and deferred revenue experienced double digit growth in U.S. dollars year-over-year, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. Our balance sheet remains strong, allowing us to repurchase over $74 million of our common shares, returning additional value to shareholders.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at . A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the live event has ended.

Item 2.02.         Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On September 22, 2010, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2010. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2010 and August 31, 2009. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718"); and

The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.

In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for periods prior to adoption have not been restated. Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $15.7 million and $28.8 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2010, and $11.0 million and $21.7 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.

Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.5 million and $9.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2010, and $5.0 million and $10.0 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of ASC 718 in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method) and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets.

Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.

On December 21, 2010, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2010. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of a charge recorded in connection with the settlement of a class action lawsuit (Civil Action No. 5:04-CV-473BR), previously pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, brought on behalf of a class of shareholders in connection with the restatement of our financial results announced in July 2004 (the Restatement Litigation).
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award's intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. This deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award.
Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, using the modified prospective transition method. Compensation costs recognized in the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009, include compensation costs based on the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.  The fair values have been estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.  In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior periods have not been restated. Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $15.3 million and $44.2 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2010, and $12.6 million and $34.2 million for the the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.7 million and $13.8 million the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2010, and $5.0 million and $15.0 million the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2009, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a charge we recorded in connection with the settlement of the Restatement Litigation.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP litigation settlement expense of $8.8 million the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2009.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the prospective-only application of ASC 718 in March 2006 (under the modified prospective transition method), the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the litigation settlement expense. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using the same methodology and information as that used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 21, 2010--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2011 third quarter ended November 30, 2010.
Total revenue for the quarter was $235.6 million, an increase of 21% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $198.8 million, up 21% year-over-year.
Strong market demand and sales execution, combined with a compelling value proposition, led to organic billings growth of over 20%, or $262 million. Also in Q3, we were particularly proud that Red Hat was recognized by CIOs for the seventh consecutive year as one of the top IT vendors delivering value according to CIO Insight Magazine Vendor Value survey. stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. In addition to delivering a compelling value proposition, we continued to drive innovation for our customers data center needs. In November, we launched the latest version of our flagship operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, giving customers a great platform for next generation architectures such as virtualization and cloud computing.
GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $38.0 million up 92% year-over-year. GAAP operating income in the year ago quarter was $19.8 million after a charge of $8.8 million for a litigation settlement. After adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses and the charge for a litigation settlement in the prior year as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $58.0 million, up 26% year-over-year.
Net income for the quarter was $26.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared with $16.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $39.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $33.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share in the year ago quarter, after adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses and the charge for a litigation settlement in the prior year as detailed in the tables below.
Operating cash flow totaled $70.8 million, as compared to $54.1 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $685.2 million, an increase of 11% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of November 30, 2010 was $1.1 billion.
Top line growth of 21% and even faster operating income growth, contributed to a 31% increase in operating cash flow, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. We are well positioned at the confluence of several hot areas of IT; open source, virtualization and cloud computing. In addition, we are executing consistently and we are making focused investments in growth initiatives. For example, in November we acquired Makara, a developer of deployment and management solutions for applications in the cloud. Makara's technologies will accelerate the development of Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution as part of our Cloud Foundations portfolio, one of our key growth initiatives.

Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $95 million, up 22% year-over-year
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 23, 2011--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2011.
Total revenue for the quarter was $244.8 million, an increase of 25% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $209.3 million, up 24% year-over-year. For the full year, total revenue was $909.3 million, an increase of 22% over the prior year, and subscription revenue was $773.4 million, up 21% year-over-year.
With record bookings and billings in the fourth quarter, we are on a run rate to become the first pure-play open source company to achieve a billion dollars in revenues next fiscal year, a milestone achievement for Red Hat and the open source community, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We believe the strong demand we experienced was largely driven by customers who are modernizing their data centers and preparing their infrastructure for cloud computing. The comprehensive portfolio that Red Hat has developed with platform, virtualization and middleware products provides enterprise customers with a foundation to deploy the next generation infrastructure.
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2011 was $39.4 million and $145.7 million, respectively. GAAP operating margin was 16.1% in the fourth quarter and 16.0% for the full year. After adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses, and in the prior year, the charge for a litigation settlement as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $61.0 million, or a 24.9% operating margin, and full year non-GAAP operating income was $225.2 million. Full year non-GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, representing an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $33.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with $26.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $23.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $51.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $39.1 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $36.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the year ago quarter.
For the full year, GAAP net income was $107.3 million or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with $87.3 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses, and in the prior year, the charge for a litigation settlement, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year was $162.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $138.1 million and $0.71 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2010.
Fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP net income benefited by approximately $0.02/share as a result of the retroactive reenactment in December 2010, of the research tax credit into US tax law. This, together with other tax benefits, including additional US foreign tax credits, reduced the fourth quarter fiscal 2011 effective tax rate for both GAAP and non-GAAP to 17%. The resulting full year effective tax rate for both GAAP and non-GAAP for fiscal 2011 is 30%.
GAAP operating cash flow totaled $95.0 million for the fourth quarter and $290.7 million for the full year. At year end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $772.3 million, an increase of 20% on a year-over-year basis and 13% sequentially. Cash and investments at February 28, 2011 totaled $1.2 billion after repurchasing approximately $11 million, or approximately 250,000 shares, of common stock in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, Red Hat repurchased approximately $90 million, or 2.9 million shares, of common stock.
Our fourth quarter results were strong and capped off a year of accelerated billings growth. Broad- based, global demand for our products and services, coupled with strong execution by our associates, resulted in over 30% year-over-year growth in billings this quarter; our fastest billings growth in 12 quarters, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. This year we focused on growth with aggressive hiring for sales and engineering, launched major product releases and invested in technologies focused on cloud computing. These investments produced greater than 20% growth in revenues and non-GAAP operating income for both the quarter and the year. At the same time, we increased non-GAAP operating margins by 110 basis points and improved cash flow. It was a good year.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at .

Item 8.01 Other Events
On March 21, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amended and restated Stock Ownership Policy for the Company's Chief Executive Officer, executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents who report directly to its Chief Executive Officer, and non-employee members of the Board. The amended and restated policy is included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by this reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
99.1 Red Hat, Inc. Stock Ownership Policy for Directors and Senior Executives, amended and restated as of March 21, 2011
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Each non-employee director, the CEO and each executive vice president and senior vice president who reports directly to the CEO (each, a "covered individual") is required during the term of his or her service with Red Hat to either hold the applicable number of shares of Red Hat common stock set forth under the Stock Ownership Guidelines or comply with the Retention Requirement set forth below. This policy applies to shares of Red Hat common stock acquired under any Red Hat equity compensation plan. This stock ownership policy is administered and interpreted by the Compensation Committee of Red Hat's Board of Directors.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Ownership levels were established based on a multiple of the average annual base salary for the office held, in the case of executives, and a multiple of the annual cash retainer in the case of directors.
 
Retention Requirement
Unless the applicable guideline is satisfied, a covered individual is required to retain an amount equal to 50% of the net shares of Red Hat common stock realized from any equity awarded after March 1, 2010. "Net shares" are those shares that remain after shares are sold or netted to pay withholding taxes and the exercise price of stock options, if applicable.
Counting Shares Owned
All shares of Red Hat common stock owned by a covered individual, or held in trust for the economic benefit of a covered individual or an immediate family member of a covered individual, whether acquired through open market purchase, vesting of restricted stock or performance share units, or stock option exercise, all vested deferred stock units and 50% of unvested restricted stock awards and unvested deferred stock units shall count towards satisfaction of the applicable guideline.
Exceptions
Relief from this policy may be granted in special circumstances, including without limitation financial hardship, compliance with a court order, educational expenses, and estate planning, at the sole discretion of Red Hat's Compensation Committee, following a written request by a covered individual.

On March 22, 2011, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") elected Sohaib Abbasi and W. Steve Albrecht to serve on the Board, effective immediately. A press release announcing the elections was issued on March 28, 2011, and is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Mr. Abbasi is a Class III director with a term expiring in 2011. Mr. Abbasi is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Informatica Corporation (NASDAQ: INFA).
Dr. Albrecht, who previously served on the Board from April 2003 until his resignation in June 2009, is a Class II director with a term expiring in 2013. Dr. Albrecht is the Andersen Alumni Professor of Accounting at the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University.
Their election brings the size of the Board to ten members. There are no arrangements or understandings pursuant to which either Mr. Abbasi or Dr. Albrecht was selected as a director. Neither Mr. Abbasi nor Dr. Albrecht has yet been appointed to any committees of the Board.
Both Mr. Abbasi and Dr. Albrecht will be compensated under the compensation plan currently in effect for the Company's non-employee directors, the 2010 Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan (the "2010 Director Compensation Plan"). Under the 2010 Director Compensation Plan, each will be eligible to receive an annual cash retainer of $50,000 for his service as a member of the Board. In addition, the 2010 Director Compensation Plan provides for the following annual cash retainers for service on committees of the Board: (i) $20,000 for service on the Audit Committee; (ii) $15,000 for service on the Compensation Committee; and (iii) $7,500 for service on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Under the 2010 Director Compensation Plan, a director may elect to receive all or a portion of any cash compensation in the form of the Company's deferred stock units ("DSUs"). DSUs represent the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock ("Common Stock") at a future date. The number of DSUs to be granted is determined by dividing the portion of the cash compensation with respect to which the election is made by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the date the cash compensation is due to be paid. DSUs issued in lieu of cash compensation are fully vested upon issuance and will be settled in shares of Common Stock upon termination of service on the Board.
In connection with their election to the Board, Mr. Abbasi and Dr. Albrecht will each be granted, on the next regularly scheduled grant date for employees, a restricted stock award equal to a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing $300,000 by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. These shares of restricted stock will vest equally over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant.
In addition to an initial equity grant, each of Mr. Abbasi and Dr. Albrecht will be eligible to receive an annual equity award consisting of a restricted stock award for a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing $175,000 by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. These shares of restricted stock will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. However, shares granted to each of Mr. Abbasi and Dr. Albrecht in connection with his first annual equity award in 2011 will be prorated based on the number of months of service as of the grant date. Under the 2010 Director Compensation Plan, directors may also elect to receive DSUs on a one-for-one basis in lieu of any annual restricted stock award. These DSUs would vest on the same basis as the annual restricted stock award and will be settled in shares of Common Stock upon termination of service on the Board.
The foregoing description of the terms of the 2010 Director Compensation Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the 2010 Director Compensation Plan, which was filed as Exhibit 10.59 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2010, and is incorporated herein by this reference.
The Company does not pay meeting fees. Non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of the Board and meetings of any committees of the Board on which they serve.
Each of Mr. Abbasi and Dr. Albrecht has entered into an indemnification agreement with the Company. In general, the indemnification agreement provides that the Company will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, indemnify the indemnitee against expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement that may be incurred in connection with the defense or settlement of threatened, pending or completed proceedings to which the indemnitee becomes subject in connection with his service as director of the Company.
The indemnification agreement provides for indemnification rights regarding both third-party claims and proceedings brought by or in the right of the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreement provides for the advancement of expenses incurred by the indemnitee under certain circumstances. The indemnification agreement is not exclusive of any other rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to which the indemnitee may be entitled, including any rights arising under the charter or bylaws of the Company, a separate agreement with the Company, or applicable law.
The foregoing summary of the indemnification agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Form of Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 28, 2007, and incorporated herein by this reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(e) On May 25, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company"):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Executive Base Salaries
The annual base salaries for the Executive Officers approved by the Committee are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K").
FY2012 Target Award Amounts under the EVCP
The target award amounts under the EVCP for FY2012 for the Executive Officers, approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 16, 2007 (the "May 2007 Form 8-K").
FY2012 Performance Objectives under the EVCP
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives for FY2012 under the EVCP are (a) a specified dollar amount of total revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flow from operations plus excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of expense related to share-based payment arrangements and the amortization of intangible assets. The cash flow from operations and operating margin performance objectives are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
The total revenue and operating margin performance objectives are based on a Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.00 Euros: U.S.$1.42 and a yen/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of 82 yen: U.S.$1.00, and these objectives are subject to adjustment if actual exchange rates for these currencies differ from these assumed rates by 5% or more. Additionally, the following items shall be excluded in determining whether any financial performance objective has been satisfied for FY2012: the impact of acquisitions and divestitures approved by the Board of Directors, goodwill write-offs, restructuring charges, litigation and insurance settlement charges, the impact of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in tax laws or accounting procedures. The Committee has reserved the right to exercise negative discretion to limit or forego any of these exclusions and may adjust any financial performance objective for FY2012 in its discretion as permitted by Section VIII of the EVCP. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the May 2007 Form 8-K.
The Committee determined that 75% of a participant's target award amount will be based upon the financial performance objectives discussed above, and 25% of a participant's target award amount will be based on individual performance objectives or the achievement of individual goals, which may be objectively or subjectively determined (the "Individual Objectives"). Individual Objectives relate to strategy development, planning and/or implementation, corporate initiatives, succession planning, retention of key employees, executive development and operational improvements. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance
objectives discussed above will be weighted equally in calculating the financial component of the award, and, with respect to each financial metric and the Individual Objectives metric, payments range from 0  50% per metric. The target award amounts approved by the Committee for the Executive Officers are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K.
Operating Performance PSU Agreement
The Operating Performance PSU Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto, is intended for use with certain grants of PSUs to Executive Officers in FY2012. Each Operating Performance PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in the Operating Performance PSU Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions of the Operating Performance PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the Operating Performance PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the Operating Performance PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2007 (the "October 2007 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the October 2007 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the Operating Performance PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted a performance share unit award for a target number of PSUs, and depending on the Company's financial performance, the executive may earn up to 200% of the target number of PSUs (the "Maximum PSUs") over a performance period with three separate performance segments corresponding to three fiscal years of the Company (the "Operating Performance Period"). Up to 25% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the first performance segment; up to 50% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the second performance segment, less the amount earned in the first performance segment; and up to 100% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the third performance segment, less the amount earned in the first and second performance segments.
The number of PSUs earned, according to the specified formula in the Operating Performance PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Operating Performance Period with respect to Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth (the "Performance Goals") as compared to the performance of the Peer Group companies during each such year of the Operating Performance Period with respect to the same Performance Goals.
If a Change in Control occurs, and provided the executive's continuous service with the Company or any of its affiliates as an employee, consultant or director (a "Business Relationship") has not ceased, the Committee may determine that either (i) all of the shares underlying the performance share unit award that have not previously been paid or earned will be treated as earned (x) to the Target Performance Share Unit level if the Change in Control occurs during the first or second Measuring Year or (y) based on the Company's performance as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date that the Change in Control occurs if the Change in Control occurs during the third Measuring Year, and will be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control or (ii) the Operating Performance PSU Agreement will be "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for" immediately following a Change in Control, using restricted stock of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Operating Performance PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Operating Performance Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Share Price Performance PSU Agreement
The Share Price Performance PSU Agreement, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto, is intended for use with certain grants of PSUs to Executive Officers in FY2012. Each Share Price Performance PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Share Price Performance PSU Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the Share Price Performance PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the Share Price Performance PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement (Fiscal Year 2010  SPP Form) filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2009 (the "June 2009 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the June 2009 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the Share Price Performance PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of PSUs, and depending on the performance of the Company's common stock over a thirty-six month period beginning on March 1, 2011 (the "Share Price Performance Period"), the executive may earn up to 200% of the target number of PSUs. The number of PSUs earned, according to the formula specified in the Share Price Performance PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the performance of the Company's stock price relative to the performance of the stock price of the Peer Group companies during the Share Price Performance Period. This performance is measured by the change in the average price of common stock calculated over the ninety-day periods ending at both the beginning and the end of the Share Price Performance Period.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Share Price Performance PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Share Price Performance Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Peer Group
The Peer Group approved by the Committee to be used to measure performance for Operating Performance PSUs and Share Price Performance PSUs to be granted to Executive Officers in FY2012 is set forth on Exhibit 99.4 to this Form 8-K.
Performance Objective for FY2012 Performance RSAs
The Committee approved a specified dollar amount of total revenues as the performance objective for awards of Performance RSAs to Executive Officers in FY2012 (the "RSA Performance Goal"). If the Company fails to achieve the RSA Performance Goal for FY2012, then all shares of restricted stock subject to the award are forfeited. If the Company achieves the Performance Goal for FY2012, 25% of the restricted stock vests on July 16, 2012, and the remainder vests ratably on a quarterly basis over the course of the subsequent threeyear period, provided that the executive's Business Relationship with Red Hat has not ceased.

1. .
Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares". The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The overall Performance Period consists of three separate performance segments corresponding to the three fiscal years of the Company that end with the end of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during each of the segments are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the Company's financial performance as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each of its fiscal years ending during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goals set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goals, all as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goals are Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goals
(i) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on the U.S. national exchange on which such stock principally trades for the 20 trading days ending on the last day of the Company's fiscal year (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to three decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan.
 
(ii) "Base Fiscal Year" for each member ("Peer") of the Peer Group and for the Company (each, an "Entity") means its full fiscal year that ends immediately before the beginning of the Performance Period;
(iii) "Operating Income" means operating income, excluding unusual or non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in applicable tax and accounting rules only (A) if and to the extent any such item is separately disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes and (B) in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, except as otherwise determined by the Committee;
(iv) "Measuring Year" means, for each Entity, its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the respective Company fiscal year for which performance goals are being measured within the Performance Period;
(v) "Percentage Operating Income Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Operating Income for such Entity's Measuring Year, and (y) Operating Income for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year, by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(vi) "Percentage Revenue Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Revenue for such Entity's Measuring Year and (y) Revenue for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Revenue" means gross revenue as such item is disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes.
The elements of each performance goal shall be as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussions and analysis, or other filings of the applicable Entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of the companies set forth below: (each individually, a "Peer"). If any Peer ceases to be a public company during any Measuring Year (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a Peer for such Measuring Year and all remaining Measuring Years in the Performance Period. If any Peer fails to file its annual audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 16 following the end of any Measuring Year, it shall be treated as if it was not a Peer for such Measuring Year.
Peer Group
[insert peer group as adopted by Compensation Committee]
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of each Company Measuring Year in the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to each of the Performance Goals shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to each Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group and listed in descending order of Percentage Revenue Growth or Percentage Operating Income Growth, whichever is being measured for such Measuring Year (e.g., if the Company
Determining Company Performance
 
(ii) ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for such Measuring Year plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for a Measuring Year then the number for this purpose would be 17). The percentile rank for each Performance Goal shall then be averaged, taking each into account equally (resulting in the "Average Percentile Rank").
(iii) . Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first Measuring Year in the Performance Period; up to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amount earned in the first Measuring Year); and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the third Measuring Year in the Performance Period (less amounts earned in the first and second Measuring Years).
Maximum Performance Share Units Earned
(iv) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be calculated by multiplying (a) times (b), and that product times (c), and that product less (d), where (a) is the payout percentage as determined under the following table based on the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such Measuring Year, (b) is the maximum percentage of the Maximum Performance Share Units that may be earned as determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c)(ii) for the Measuring Year in question, (c) is the Number of Target Performance Share Units, and (d) is the number of Performance Share Units earned in prior Measuring Years. The number of Shares distributed will equal the number of Performance Share Units earned under this provision.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the Average Percentile Rank for each Measuring Year shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the Average Percentile Rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
 
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section. The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
Continuous Service Relationship
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in ), the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the fiscal year in the Performance Period in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such fiscal year prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank for such fiscal year.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
 
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, with respect to which the Performance Share Units were earned, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
 
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .
No Rights as Stockholder

Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding
 
obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal,
 
state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Participant's Acceptance
(g) . This Agreement, the Performance Share Units and payments made pursuant to this Agreement are intended to comply with or qualify for an exemption from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A") and shall be construed consistently therewith and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with that intention. Terms defined in the Agreement shall have the meanings given such terms under Section 409A if and to the extent required to comply with Section 409A.

Any payments described in this Section 14(g) that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant hereby agrees that he is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of separation from service (as determined under Section 409A (the "New Payment Date")), except as Section 409A may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.

Any conversion under clause (i) or determination of earned Performance Share Units under clause (ii) shall be at the Target Performance Share Unit level if the Change in Control occurs in the first or second Measuring Year and at the Actual Performance Share Unit Level (as defined below) if the Change in Control occurs in the third Measuring Year. "Actual Performance Share Unit Level" means the number of Performance Share Units that would have been earned (if any) if the third Measuring Year had ended on the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date that the Change in Control occurred. The Committee shall determine the actions under this paragraph (a).
(b) The Restricted Stock shall become vested (measuring vesting years from the Grant Date of the Performance Share Units) in accordance with the following schedule if the Participant's Business Relationship continues (to the extent that the end of the applicable year in the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control):

Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration (other than continuing services).
The Performance Period consists of one performance segment corresponding to the thirty-six month period that begins on the first day of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during the Performance Period are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention. The Performance Period will be shortened in the event of an intervening Acquisition or a cessation of employment, as provided for under the terms of this Agreement, including Appendix A.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the performance of the Company's common stock relative to the Peer Group (as defined below) as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the Number of Maximum Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goal set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goal, as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goal is Relative Share Price Performance. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goal
(i) "Acquisition" means an event that constitutes a Change in Control (as defined in ) under clauses B or C of that definition.
Appendix A
 
(ii) "Acquisition Price" means the per share equivalent on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise of all outstanding options, of the cash consideration and securities paid or payable to the Company or its equity owners at the closing of an Acquisition, with any securities that are not then publicly traded being valued by the Company's Board.
(iii) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on a U.S. national securities exchange on which such stock principally trades for each trading day during the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to two decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan; , , that if the Company has an Acquisition, the "Average Closing Price" means the Acquisition Price. For purposes of clarity, Average Closing Price is determined separately for each of the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period.
provided
however
(iv) "Entity" means each of (x) a member of the Peer Group and (y) the Company;
(v) "First Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the ninety-day period ending on the first day of the Performance Period;
(vi) "Relative Share Price Performance" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) the Average Closing Price during the Second Measurement Period (or, as applicable, the Acquisition Price) and (y) the Average Closing Price during the First Measurement Period by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Second Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the ninety-day period ending on the last day of the Performance Period.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of each of: . If any member of the Peer Group ceases to be a public company during the Performance Period (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a member of the Peer Group for the Performance Period.
Peer Group
[insert peer group as adopted by Compensation Committee]
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to the Performance Goal shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to the Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for the
Determining Company Performance
 
Performance Period plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 17).
(ii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be determined under the following table based on the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the percentile rank for the Performance Period shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the percentile rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . The Participant must be employed by the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") on the last day of the Performance Period, unless such Business Relationship ceases (i) due to death, Disability (as defined below) or termination without Good Cause (as defined in ) as provided for in this Section 4, or (ii) within twelve months following a Change in Control as provided for in Appendix A. If the Participant's Business Relationship ceases for any reason prior to the last day of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section 4 or . The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate and shall not be extended by any notice of termination period. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.

Appendix A
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the termination), based on the number
Death or Disability
 
of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause, the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the termination), based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Cessation without Good Cause
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, in which falls the end of the Performance Period, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the
Appendix A
 
Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
 
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .

Appendix A
12. .
Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the next preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by
 
withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (a) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (b) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
(e) The Participant has reviewed and understands the tax withholding and payment obligations as set forth in this Agreement and understands that the Company is not providing any tax advice and that the Participant should consult with Participant's own tax advisors on the U.S. federal, state, foreign and local tax and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
13. . In accepting the Performance Share Units, Participant acknowledges that: (a) the grant of the Performance Share Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of Performance Share Units, or benefits in lieu of Performance Share Units even if Performance Share Units have been granted repeatedly in the past; (b) all decisions with respect to future awards of Performance Share Units, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (c) the future value of the underlying Shares is
Nature of Grant
 
unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty; (d) in consideration of the award of Performance Share Units, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Performance Share Units or any diminution in value of the Performance Share Units or Shares received when the Performance Share Units are earned resulting from the Participant's termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever and whether or not in breach of local employment laws), and Participant irrevocably releases the Company and/or the Affiliate from any such claim that may arise; (e) in the event of involuntary termination of Participant's employment (whether or not in breach of local employment laws), Participant's right to receive Performance Share Units and vesting under the Plan, if any, will terminate effective as of the date that Participant is no longer actively employed and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law or contract, and the Company shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when Participant is no longer actively employed for purposes of the Performance Share Units; (f) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding Participant's participation in the Plan, or Participant's acquisition or sale of the underlying Shares; and (g) Participant is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding Participant's participation in the Plan before taking any action related to the Plan.

Any payments described in this Section 14(g) that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. If and to the extent any portion of any payment, compensation or other benefit provided to the Participant in connection with his employment termination is determined to constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A and the Participant is a specified employee as defined in Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, as determined by the Company in accordance with its procedures, by which determination the Participant hereby agrees that he is bound, such portion of the payment, compensation or other benefit shall not be paid before the day that is six months plus one day after the date of separation from service (as determined under Section 409A (the "New Payment Date")), except as Section 409A may then permit. The aggregate of any payments that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant during the period between the date of separation from service and the New Payment Date shall be paid to the Participant in a lump sum on such New Payment Date, and any remaining payments will be paid on their original schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company, its Affiliates, Directors, Officers and Agents shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant, or for any action taken by the Committee.
Section 409A
(h) . This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of the conflicts of laws thereof.

The Committee shall determine the actions under this paragraph (a).
(b) The Restricted Stock shall become vested (measuring vesting years from the Grant Date of the Performance Share Units) in accordance with the following schedule if the Participant's Business Relationship continues (to the extent that the end of the applicable year in the Performance Period has not occurred as of the date of the Change in Control):

(c) For purposes of this , this Agreement shall be considered to be continued, assumed, converted or substituted for:

the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.  
Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $16.2 million and $13.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense which may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the particular period's operational performance. For example, the amount recognized for share-based awards is directly related to the underlying share price of our common stock as of the date of grant, which, in the short-term, may not be directly related to our operational performance. Consequently, management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.9 million and $4.5 million for the three months ended May 31, 2011, and May 31, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the potential variability in valuing share-based awards and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.

RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 22, 2011--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2012 first quarter ended May 31, 2011.

Red Hat has begun fiscal year 2012 with a strong first quarter including year-over-year billings growth of 28% that contributed to revenue and profitability that exceeded the high-end of our expectations, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We believe there is a fundamental shift in IT spending, in which cloud computing and virtualization have become key strategic priorities. We believe that Red Hat is well positioned to capitalize on this growing demand as enterprise customers look to Red Hat when upgrading and modernizing their IT infrastructure.
GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $45.4 million, or a 17.1% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $66.5 million, up 28% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.1%, up 30 basis points from the year ago quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $32.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared with $24.1 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $47.0 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, as compared to $35.6 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.

Strong sales execution, focused spending and good collections drove 49% growth in operating cash flow year-over-year, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. Red Hat grew first quarter non-GAAP operating income by 28% year-over-year even as we ramped up marketing spending for the Red Hat Summit and product launches, and continued investments in R&D to enable further broadening of our product portfolio. We introduced innovative new cloud technologies such as OpenShift, our PaaS offering, and CloudForms, our IaaS offering. In addition, we enhanced our core products, including the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 and strengthened our partnerships with the launch of Open Virtualization Alliance.

(e) 2011 Performance Compensation Plan
On August 11, 2011, the stockholders of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's 2011 Performance Compensation Plan (the "2011 Performance Plan").
The following paragraphs provide a summary of the principal features of the 2011 Performance Plan. The following summary is not a complete description of all the provisions of the 2011 Performance Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2011 Performance Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
The 2011 Performance Plan is designed to enable the Company to provide tax deductible "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), including by tying compensation to qualifying performance measures. This is intended to help enhance stockholder value and assist the Company in attracting and retaining executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who, because of the extent of their responsibilities, can make significant contributions to the Company's success by their ability, industry, loyalty and services. If certain requirements are satisfied, compensation awarded under the 2011 Performance Plan to covered employees will qualify as deductible "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
General.
Eligible participants in the 2011 Performance Plan ("Participants") are the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers who are chosen solely at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"). No person is automatically entitled to participate in the 2011 Performance Plan in any plan year.
Eligibility.
The Compensation Committee will be responsible for the general administration and interpretation of the 2011 Performance Plan and for carrying out its provisions. The Compensation Committee has the authority to select persons to receive awards from among the eligible employees and set the terms and conditions of each award consistent with the terms of the 2011 Performance Plan.
Administration.
Under the 2011 Performance Plan, Participants will be eligible to receive awards based upon the attainment and certification of certain performance goals established by the Compensation Committee over the applicable performance period. The performance goals that may be selected by the Compensation Committee include one or more of the following: revenue growth, revenue, gross margins, net margins, operating income, operating income growth, pre-tax income, after-tax income, net income, net earnings, earnings per share (basic and diluted), earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, return on invested capital, return on equity, return on assets, economic value added (or an equivalent metric), cash flow from operations, cash flow per share, changes in deferred revenues, share price performance, total stockholder return, improvement in or attainment of expense levels, improvement in or attainment of working capital levels, attainment of strategic and operational initiatives, market share, gross profits, comparisons with various stock market indices, and/or implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with respect to research, development, products or projects. Performance goals may vary by Participant and award and also may be based solely by reference to the Company's performance or the performance of an affiliate, division, business unit or department of the Company for or within which the Participant is primarily employed, or based upon the relative performance of other companies, or upon comparisons of any of the indicators of performance relative to other companies.
Determination of Awards.
The Compensation Committee may provide that attainment of a performance goal shall be measured by adjusting the evaluation of performance as follows: to eliminate the effects of charges for restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items and other unusual or non-recurring items, as well as the cumulative effect of accounting changes, in each case as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or identified in the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussion and analysis or other filings with the SEC.
The Compensation Committee must set the goal for a particular performance period no later than 90 days after it begins or, if earlier, before the end of the first 25% of the period and must certify performance attainment after the performance period ends.
The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate any award that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the 2011 Performance Plan, including through prorating because the individual was not employed for the full performance period. The Compensation Committee may choose to exercise this discretion to reflect its assessment of the quality of achievement of financial or operational goals established by the Compensation Committee or to take into account additional factors that the Compensation Committee may deem relevant to the assessment of individual or corporate performance or pursuant to such other timing as the Compensation Committee selects consistent with applicable tax laws. The Compensation Committee does not have the discretion to increase the amount of any compensation that would otherwise be due upon the attainment of the applicable performance goal by a Participant. No payment will be made to a Participant whose employment is terminated for "cause" as defined in a plan or agreement covering the individual or who resigns, other than in limited circumstances, before payment is due.
All awards will be paid in cash or, to the extent provided in such plan, share awards under a stockholder-approved stock plan of the Company. Payment to each Participant will be made no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year of the Company in which the applicable performance period ends or pursuant to such other timing as the Compensation Committee selects consistent with applicable state laws. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to defer receipt of the payment of an award that would otherwise be delivered to a Participant under the 2011 Performance Plan.
Payment of Awards.
No Participant in the 2011 Performance Plan may be granted performance awards that are denominated in shares of the Company's common stock in any 12-month period with respect to more than 1,000,000 shares. In addition to the foregoing, the maximum dollar value that may be granted to any Participant in any 12-month period under the 2011 Performance Plan with respect to performance awards that are valued in cash or property other than shares is $10,000,000.
Maximum Award.
The 2011 Performance Plan is effective as of August 11, 2011. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the 2011 Performance Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by applicable law, including Section 162(m) of the Code.
Term of 2011 Performance Plan.
On August 11, 2011, the Company held its 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). Of the 192,965,134 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 15, 2011, the record date, 170,400,078 shares were represented at the Annual Meeting (in person or by proxy), constituting 88.31% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company (1) elected Sohaib Abbasi, Narendra K. Gupta, William S. Kaiser and James M. Whitehurst as directors of the Company, (2) ratified the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2012, (3) approved a non-binding advisory resolution relating to the Company's executive compensation, (4) participated in a non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future stockholder votes on executive compensation and (5) approved the Company's 2011 Performance Compensation Plan.
The final voting results are set forth below.
 
 
 
 
 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, compensation tables and narrative discussion of the Proxy Statement for the 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, is hereby APPROVED.
 
 
 
 
 
In connection with the stockholder vote on Proposal No. 4, the Company determined that it will hold an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement every year, until such time as the next advisory vote is submitted to the stockholders of the Company with regard to the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, or the Board of Directors otherwise determines that a different frequency for such advisory votes is in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company.

No payment will be made if a Participant's employment is terminated either by the Company for "cause" (as defined in a plan or agreement covering the Participant and implemented by the Committee in its sole discretion) or by the Participant by resignation (other than through retirement or for "good reason"). Nothing in this Section 4.5 is intended to prohibit establishing a Performance Period under Section 4.1 that is specific to the covered individual.

4.6.
Adjustments.
 
 
The Board may, from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan as it shall deem advisable, subject to any requirement for stockholder approval imposed by applicable law, including Section 162(m) of the Code. No amendments to, or termination of, the Plan shall in any way impair the rights of a Participant under any Performance Award previously granted without such Participant's consent.
5.1.
Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the provisions of this Plan shall be administered and interpreted in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code to ensure the deductibility by the Company of the payment of Performance Awards.
5.2.
Section 162(m) of the Code.
 
The Company or an Affiliate shall have the right to make all payments or distributions pursuant to the Plan to a Participant, net of any applicable federal, state and local taxes required to be paid or withheld. The Company or an Affiliate shall have the right to withhold from wages, Performance Awards or other amounts otherwise payable to such Participant such withholding taxes as may be required by law, or to otherwise require the Participant to pay such withholding taxes. If the Participant shall fail to make such tax payments as are required, the Company or an Affiliate shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to such Participant or to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligations.
5.3.
Tax Withholding.
 
Nothing in this Plan shall provide any Participant a right to receive any Performance Award or payment under the Plan with respect to a Performance Period. Nothing in the Plan nor the grant of a Performance Award hereunder shall confer upon any Participant
5.4.
Right of Discharge Reserved; Claims to Performance Awards.
 
the right to continue in the employment of the Company or an Affiliate or affect any right that the Company or an Affiliate may have to terminate the employment of (or to demote or to exclude from future Performance Awards under the Plan) any such Participant at any time for any reason. Except as specifically provided by the Committee, the Company shall not be liable for the loss of existing or potential profit from a Performance Award granted in the event of the termination of employment of any Participant. No Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Performance Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under the Plan.
 
All Performance Awards made pursuant to the Plan are in consideration of services performed or to be performed for the Company or an Affiliate, division or business unit of the Company. Any income or gain realized pursuant to Performance Awards under the Plan constitute a special incentive payment to the Participant and shall not be taken into account, to the extent permissible under applicable law, as compensation for purposes of any of the employee benefit plans of the Company or an Affiliate except as may be determined by the Committee or by the Board or board of directors of the applicable Affiliate.
5.5.
Nature of Payments.
 
Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
5.6.
Other Plans.
 
If any provision of the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall (a) be deemed limited to the extent that such court of competent jurisdiction deems it lawful, valid and/or enforceable and as so limited shall remain in full force and effect, and (b) not affect any other provision of the Plan or part thereof, each of which shall remain in full force and effect. If the making of any payment or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan shall be held unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent any other payment or benefit from being made or provided under the Plan, and if the making of any payment in full or the provision of any other benefit required under the Plan in full would be unlawful or otherwise invalid or unenforceable, then such unlawfulness, invalidity or unenforceability shall not prevent such payment or benefit from being made or provided in part, to the extent that it would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, and the maximum payment or benefit that would not be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable shall be made or provided under the Plan.
5.7.
Severability.
 
As used in the Plan, the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
5.8.
Construction.
 
The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation and deferred compensation if permitted by the Committee.

On September 21, 2011, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2011. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011 and August 31, 2010. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $18.8 million and $34.9 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011, and $15.7 million and $28.8 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.2 million and $10.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011, and $4.5 million and $9.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the potential variability in valuing share-based awards and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

EXHIBIT INDEX

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Second Quarter Results
Second quarter revenue of $281 million, up 28% year-over-year
Second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.20, up 67% year-over-year; non-GAAP EPS of $0.29, up 53% year-over-year
Second quarter deferred revenue of $813 million, up 25% year-over-year
Second quarter operating cash flow of $77 million, up 20% year-over-year
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 21, 2011--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2012 second quarter ended August 31, 2011.
Total revenue for the quarter was $281.3 million, an increase of 28% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $238.3 million, up 28% year-over-year.
The combination of strong sales execution and customer demand led to second quarter revenue that was above our guidance and represented our fourth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We continued to win and strengthen relationships with enterprise customers who partner with Red Hat to reduce costs while modernizing their IT infrastructure to enable applications to run on bare metal, virtualization and in the cloud. Based on the strong first half results, we believe Red Hat remains well positioned to finish fiscal 2012 as the first billion dollar open source software vendor.
GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $52.5 million, or 18.7% operating margin. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $76.4 million, up 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.2%, up 250 basis points from the year ago quarter.
Net income for the quarter was $40.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared with $23.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $56.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, as compared to $36.8 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter included a discrete tax benefit of $2.1 million, approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Excluding this tax benefit, GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.19 and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.28 for the quarter.
Operating cash flow was $77.1 million for the second quarter, as compared to $64.3 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $813.2 million, an increase of 25% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of August 31, 2011 was $1.3 billion.
Our investments in sales and R&D continued to pay off, producing market share gains, higher revenue and 30% year-over-year billings growth, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. Our productivity continued to improve as evidenced by non-GAAP operating income growth of 41% and cash flow growth of 20% in Q2. Moreover, year-to-date non-GAAP operating income grew 35% and operating cash flow grew 34% compared to the first half of last fiscal year.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at .

Item 8.01 Other Events
On October 7, 2011, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 3, 2011, by and among Red Hat, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Red Hat"), Gluster, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Gluster"), Matte Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Red Hat ("Matte"), and Fortis Advisors LLC, the representative of the holders of shares of Gluster capital stock and vested options (the "Merger Agreement"), Red Hat completed its previously announced acquisition of Gluster through a merger of Matte with and into Gluster (the "Merger"). Gluster develops, distributes and provides support for open source storage software.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing Red Hat paid approximately $136.2 million in cash, to be distributed to the holders of Gluster capital stock and vested options in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Dr. Naren Gupta, a director of Red Hat since 2005, was a director of Gluster and is the Managing Director of Nexus Venture Partners ("Nexus"), a venture capital fund that was a principal investor in Gluster. Nexus held approximately 36.4% percent of the shares of Gluster capital stock and vested options outstanding on the closing date.
Dr. Gupta did not attend the meeting at which Red Hat's Board of Directors (the "Board") approved the transaction and recused himself from Board deliberations with respect to the transaction. The purchase price in the transaction was determined through arms length negotiations between Red Hat and Gluster.
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, Red Hat assumed the Gluster, Inc. 2005 Stock Plan and all Gluster shares and outstanding options to purchase Gluster shares that were unvested as of the effective time of the Merger. In connection with such assumption, appropriate adjustments were made in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement to convert such Gluster shares into an aggregate of approximately 350,000 shares of Red Hat's common stock, par value $.0001 per share and adjust the exercise prices for such options.

On December 19, 2011, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2011. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2011 and November 30, 2010. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $20.8 million and $55.7 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2011, and $15.3 million and $44.2 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.5 million and $14.6 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2011, and $4.7 million and $13.8 million for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2010, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the potential variability in valuing share-based awards and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate our performance using information used by management.
The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 28, 2012, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K. We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months and fiscal years ended February 29, 2012 and February 28, 2011. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718"); and
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations.
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $23.6 million and $79.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, and $16.4 million and $60.6 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.1 million and $19.7 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, and $5.2 million and $19.0 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the potential variability in valuing share-based awards and the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets.

s
Fourth quarter revenue of $297 million, up 21% year-over-year; full fiscal year revenue of $1.13 billion, up 25% year-over-year
Fourth quarter GAAP EPS of $0.18, up 6% year-over-year; non-GAAP EPS of $0.29, up 12% year-over-year
Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $128 million, up 35% year-over-year; full fiscal year operating cash flow of $392 million, up 35% year-over-year
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 28, 2012--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012.
Total revenue for the quarter was $297.0 million, an increase of 21% from the year ago quarter. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $255.2 million, up 22% year-over-year. For the full fiscal year 2012, total revenue was $1.13 billion, an increase of 25% over the prior year, and subscription revenue was $965.6 million, up 25% year-over-year.
The strength of our fourth quarter was a fitting conclusion to a remarkably strong year for our business. Our investments to expand our geographic sales footprint and add sales people with targeted industry and product knowledge has accelerated our growth, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. Red Hat is the first pure-play, open source company, and one of only a select few software companies, to have achieved the billion dollar revenue milestone. The open source technologies which we provide are being selected by more customers every day as they re-architect the infrastructure of their data centers for greater efficiency, agility and cloud enablement.
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2012 was $48.5 million and $199.9 million, respectively. GAAP operating margin was 16.3% in the fourth quarter and 17.6% for the full year. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $77.2 million, or a 26.0% operating margin, and full year non-GAAP operating income was $298.9 million. Full year non-GAAP operating margin was 26.4%, representing an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $36.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $38.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $33.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $57.2 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $55.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $51.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year ago fourth quarter benefited by approximately $0.02 per share as a result of the retroactive reenactment in December 2010 of the US research tax credit.
For the full year, GAAP net income was $146.6 million or $0.75 per diluted share, compared with $107.3 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year was $216.4 million or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to $162.8 million and $0.83 per diluted share for the previous fiscal year.
Operating cash flow totaled $128.0 million for the fourth quarter and $391.9 million for the full year. At the end of the fiscal year, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $946.7 million, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis and 16% sequentially. Cash and investments at February 29, 2012 totaled $1.3 billion after repurchasing approximately $76.3 million, or approximately 1.8 million shares, of common stock in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year 2012, Red Hat repurchased approximately $133.2 million, or approximately 3.2 million shares, of common stock.
We experienced impressive breadth and depth of demand for our technologies this quarter whether by geography or by industry vertical. This resulted in record financial metrics for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2012, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. Our strategy for growth, coupled with relentless day-to-day execution of the business, has been successful. We experienced a significant increase in large deals, both in Q4 and for the full year which contributed to annual organic growth of 25% in revenue, 33% in non-GAAP operating income and 35% growth in operating cash flow.
Additional information on Red Hat's reported results, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP adjusted results, are included in the financial tables below. A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at .

Exhibit 99.1
 
 Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of Red Hat's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Raleigh
March 28, 2012
The new program begins April 1, 2012, replacing the current repurchase program that will expire on March 31, 2012. To date, approximately $214 million has been used to repurchase shares under the current program.
"We have repurchased over 5.8 million shares of Red Hat common stock under the current program, equivalent to 3% of our shares outstanding as of February 29, 2012," stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. "Our management team and Board of Directors have a strong conviction in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to generate cash flow. We believe that stock repurchases are an excellent means to return value to our shareholders."
The timing and the amount of any repurchases of common stock will be determined by Red Hat management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Repurchases of common stock may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when Red Hat might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
The repurchase program will be funded using Red Hat's working capital. As of February 29, 2012, Red Hat had cash and investments of approximately $1.3 billion.
Red Hat had approximately 192.7 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 29, 2012.

 Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the appointment of enterprise software industry veteran Arun Oberoi as executive vice president of global sales and services. Oberoi brings strong go-to-market executive experience  including global leadership roles with HP and IBM  to Red Hat, where he will further develop the company's sales and services strategy.
RALEIGH, N.C.  May 24, 2012
"As Red Hat continues to make strategic investments in our business and move into new markets, having seamless integration between sales and services and our technology vision is critical," said Jim Whitehurst, president and CEO, Red Hat. "With his outstanding track record of success and his global sales, services and management experience, I am very confident in Arun's ability to help Red Hat capitalize on our opportunities as we meet our customers' evolving technology and business needs."
Oberoi has led and repeatedly built rapidly-scaling businesses across a wide spectrum of companies ranging from start-ups and mid-sized companies to multi-billion dollar global organizations. Oberoi comes to Red Hat from Viridity Software, a data center infrastructure management start-up, where he served as president and CEO, doubling new customers every consecutive quarter in 2011, and seeing the company's flagship product through its recent acquisition by Schneider Electric. Prior to Viridity, Oberoi was CEO of Aveksa, a leading access governance and management software start-up, where he led the company to fast growth and a financing round for further expansion.
In his earlier roles, Oberoi was responsible for leading worldwide sales, services and marketing organizations with a strong focus on cultivating partner ecosystems as a core element of customer value delivery and synergistic market reach. He was executive vice president of worldwide sales and services at Micromuse, a market-leading provider of network and service management solutions. Micromuse was acquired by IBM, where Oberoi led the integration and its continued fast growth and field expansion as vice president within IBM Tivoli.
Before that, Oberoi had an accomplished career at HP, where he held various executive leadership roles, including vice president and general manager of worldwide top 100 corporate accounts and industries, as well as vice president and general manager of worldwide sales and marketing for HP's software business. As part of HP's software business, he led the development of a dedicated worldwide sales and marketing organization for the portfolio, which included HP's OpenView Management software, driving sales growth from initial stages to $1 billion in revenues.
Oberoi earned his Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. He also has a Master of Business Administration from Panjab University Business School in Chandigarh, India, and a Bachelor of Arts, with honors, from India's Delhi University.

(e) On May 23, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company"):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Executive Base Salaries
The annual base salaries for the Executive Officers approved by the Committee are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K").
FY2013 Target Award Amounts under the EVCP
The target award amounts under the EVCP for FY2013 for the Executive Officers, approved by the Committee, are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 16, 2007 (the "May 2007 Form 8-K").
FY2013 Performance Objectives under the EVCP
As approved by the Committee, the financial performance objectives for FY2013 under the EVCP are (a) a specified dollar amount of total revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flow from operations plus excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of expense related to share-based payment arrangements and the amortization of intangible assets. The cash flow from operations and operating margin performance objectives are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
The total revenue and operating margin performance objectives are based on a Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.00 Euros: U.S.$1.31 and a yen/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of 82 yen:U.S.$1.00, and these objectives are subject to adjustment if actual exchange rates for these currencies differ from these assumed rates by 5% or more. Additionally, the following items shall be excluded in determining whether any financial performance objective has been satisfied for FY2013: the impact of acquisitions and divestitures approved by the Board of Directors, goodwill write-offs, restructuring charges, litigation and insurance settlement charges, the impact of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in tax laws or accounting procedures. The Committee has reserved the right to exercise negative discretion to limit or forego any of these exclusions and may adjust any financial performance objective for FY2013 in its discretion as permitted by Section VIII of the EVCP. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the May 2007 Form 8-K.
The Committee determined that 75% of a participant's target award amount will be based upon the financial performance objectives discussed above, and 25% of a participant's target award amount will be based on individual performance objectives or the achievement of individual goals, which may be objectively or subjectively determined (the "Individual Objectives"). Individual Objectives relate to strategy development, planning and/or implementation, corporate initiatives, succession planning, retention of key employees, executive development and operational improvements. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance
objectives discussed above will be weighted equally in calculating the financial component of the award, and, with respect to each financial metric and the Individual Objectives metric, payments range from 0  50% per metric. The target award amounts approved by the Committee for the Executive Officers are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K.
Operating Performance PSUs
The Committee approved the performance objectives to be used with, and authorized the grant of, Operating Performance PSUs to each Executive Officer in FY2013. Operating Performance PSUs represent the right to receive in the future shares of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such shares, according to a formula specified in the form of Operating Performance PSU agreement (the "Operating Performance PSU Agreement") filed as Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 27, 2011 (the "May 2011 Form 8-K"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Operating Performance PSU Agreement. The summary of the terms of the Operating Performance PSU Agreement in the May 2011 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Share Price PSUs
The Committee approved the performance objective to be used with, and authorized the grant of, Share Price PSUs to each Executive Officer in FY2013. Share Price PSUs represent the right to receive in the future shares of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such shares, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the form of Share Price PSU agreement (the "Share Price PSU Agreement") filed as Exhibit 99.3 to the May 2011 Form 8-K. The summary of the terms of the Share Price PSU Agreement in the May 2011 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Peer Group
The Peer Group approved by the Committee to be used to measure performance for the Operating Performance PSUs and the Share Price PSUs to be granted to Executive Officers in FY2013 is set forth on Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.
Performance RSAs
The Committee approved a specified dollar amount of revenues as the performance objective for awards of performance RSAs to Executive Officers in FY2013 (the "RSA Performance Goal"). If the Company fails to achieve the RSA Performance Goal for FY2013, then all shares of restricted stock subject to the award are forfeited. If the Company achieves the Performance Goal for FY2013, 25% of the restricted stock vests on July 16, 2013, and the remainder vests ratably on a quarterly basis over the course of the subsequent threeyear period, provided that the executive's Business Relationship with Red Hat has not ceased. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the form of RSA award agreement filed as Exhibit 99.4 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 25, 2010 (the "May 2010 Form 8-K"). The summary of the terms in the May 2010 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
         On June 20, 2012, Red Hat, Inc. announced the financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2012. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  We disclosed non-GAAP financial information in the press release for the three months ended May 31, 2012 and May 31, 2011. These non-GAAP disclosures include a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
  the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718");
  the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
  the impact of a charge recorded in connection with subleasing and exiting one of the Companys facilities located in Raleigh, NC (the Facility Exit) .
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
             We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense that may vary from period to period due to changes in the price of our common stock that may not be directly related to our operating performance during the period in which the expense is recognized, and management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $22.2 million and $16.2 million for the three months ended May 31, 2012, and May 31, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $4.8 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended May 31, 2012, and May 31, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a charge we recorded in connection with the Facility Exit.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP expense of $3.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2012.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of potential variations in the amount of expense for share-based awards recognized from period to period due to changes in the price of our common stock,  the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the expense we recognized in connection with the Facility Exit. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.
         The information furnished pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99.1 referenced herein, shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

On August 9, 2011, the stockholders of Red Hat, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Amended Plan").
The following paragraphs provide a summary of the purpose and key provisions of the Amended Plan. The following summary is not a complete description of all the provisions of the Amended Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended Plan, a copy of which was previously filed as Appendix A to the Company's proxy statement dated June 25, 2012.
Purpose
The Amended Plan allows the Company to provide directors, employees, consultants and advisors who are selected to receive awards under the Amended Plan the opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company. Red Hat's Board of Directors (the "Board") believes that equity incentives are a significant factor in attracting, retaining and motivating eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the Company's long-term success.
Key Provisions
The following is a summary of the key provisions of the Amended Plan:
  August 7, 2022
Plan Termination Date:
      Directors, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company or an affiliate of the Company
Eligible Participants:
Shares Authorized:
 
 
 
 
 
Award Types:
 
 
 
 
 
Award Limits Per Person Per Fiscal Year:
 
 
 
Determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. Currently, stock options are granted with a four-year vesting schedule with awards vesting 25% after one year and quarterly thereafter. RSAs and RSUs are granted with a four year vesting schedule with awards vesting 25% annually
Vesting:
Not permitted
Repricing of stock options or SARs:
As of February 29, 2012 over 4,500 persons would have been eligible to receive awards under the Amended Plan, including the Company's executive officers and non-employee directors. Other than grants of awards to independent directors pursuant to our 2010 Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan or successor director compensation plans, the granting of future awards under the Amended Plan is discretionary, and the Company cannot now determine the number or type of awards to be granted in the future to any particular person or group.
Plan Benefits:
 
On August 9, 2012, the Company held its 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting").

At the Annual Meeting, stockholders of the Company (1) elected Marye Anne Fox and Donald H. Livingstone as directors of the Company, each to serve for a three-year term as a Class I director, (2) ratified the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2013, (3) approved a non-binding advisory resolution relating to the Company's executive compensation, (4) approved an amendment and restatement of the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan and (5) approved a stockholder proposal relating to declassification of the Company's Board of Directors.

RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, compensation tables and narrative discussion of the Proxy Statement for the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, is hereby APPROVED.
 
 
 
RESOLVED, that shareholders of Red Hat, Inc. urge the Board of Directors to take all necessary steps (other than any steps that must be taken by shareholders) to eliminate the classification of the Board of Directors and to require that all directors elected at or after the annual meeting held in 2013 be elected on an annual basis. Implementation of this proposal should not prevent any director elected prior to the annual meeting held in 2013 from completing the term for which such director was elected.

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On September 24, 2012, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2012. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In the press release, we disclosed non-GAAP financial information for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2012 and August 31, 2011. These non-GAAP disclosures include non-GAAP revenue growth rates measured on a constant currency basis and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
We disclosed non-GAAP revenue growth rates for subscription revenue and total revenue measured on a constant currency basis for the three months ended August 31, 2012, in an effort to provide a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed when compared to the three months ended August 31, 2011.   Approximately 43% of our revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2012, was produced by sales outside the United States. The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for each month in an applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies results in increased revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations decreases if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies.  Using the average foreign currency exchange rates for each month of the three months ended August 31, 2011, our subscription revenue and total revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2012, would have been higher than we reported by $12.2 million and $14.2 million, respectively.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense which may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the particular periods operational performance. For example, the amount recognized for share-based awards is directly related to the underlying share price of our common stock as of the date of grant, which, in the short-term, may not be directly related to our operational performance. Consequently, management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.     Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $23.9 million and $46.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2012, and $18.8 million and $34.9 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $5.4 million and $10.3 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2012, and $5.2 million and $10.1 million for the three months and six months ended August 31, 2011, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a charge we recorded in connection with the Facility Exit.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP expense of $3.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2012.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the effect of exchange rate differences, potential variations in the amount of expense for share-based awards recognized from period to period due to changes in the price of our common stock, the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the expense we recognized in connection with the Facility Exit. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.

RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 24, 2012--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2013 second quarter ended August 31, 2012.
Total revenue for the quarter was $322.6 million, an increase of 15% in U.S. dollars from the year ago quarter, or 20% measured in constant currency, as detailed in the tables below. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $278.8 million, up 17% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, or 22% measured in constant currency, as detailed in the tables below.
Our double-digit growth was driven by demand for Red Hats open source technologies that are key to creating innovation, scale and flexibility in our customers data centers and their businesses, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. At Red Hat, we firmly believe in the strength of community-powered innovation. In early September, we were pleased to be recognized by Forbes, Inc. on its list of the . We are also proud that our customers who have built mission-critical systems on Red Hat technologies are also reflected on the Forbes list of innovative companies.
Worlds Most Innovative Companies
GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $50.0 million, down 5% year-over-year. GAAP operating margin was 15.5%. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $79.2 million, up 4% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.6%.
Net income for the quarter was $35.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $40.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $54.9 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, as compared to $56.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. The year ago quarter would have been $0.28 per diluted share excluding a discrete tax benefit of $2.1 million, or approximately $0.01 per share.
Operating cash flow was $103.9 million for the second quarter, as compared to $77.1 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $944.4 million, an increase of 16% on a year-over-year basis.

On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue grew 22% year-over-year while total revenue grew 20%. Our business model and offerings continue to appeal to customers despite the global economic malaise, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. This quarter marked a significant ramp-up in investments in our nascent storage business, with the launch in late June of Red Hat Storage Server 2.0. Furthermore, we announced two small technology acquisitions in the middleware space to further round out our offerings, which decreased the quarters EPS by approximately $0.01 per share due to one-time closing costs.

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On December 20, 2012, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2012. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.  
In the press release, we disclosed non-GAAP financial information for the three months and nine months ended November 30, 2012 and November 30, 2011. These non-GAAP disclosures include non-GAAP revenue growth rates measured on a constant currency basis and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of a charge recorded in connection with subleasing and exiting one of the Companys facilities located in Raleigh, NC (the Facility Exit).
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.

The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for each month in an applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies results in increased revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations decreases if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies.

We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a charge we recorded in connection with the Facility Exit.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP expense of $3.1 million for the nine months ended November 30, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
Red Hat Reports Third Quarter Results
Third quarter revenue of $344 million, up 18% year-over-year
Third quarter subscription revenue of $294 million, up 19% year-over-year
Third quarter total deferred revenue of $988 million, up 21% year-over-year
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--December 20, 2012--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal year 2013 third quarter ended November 30, 2012.
Total revenue for the quarter was $343.6 million, an increase of 18% in U.S. dollars from the year ago quarter, or 21% measured in constant currency, as detailed in the tables below. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $294.2 million, up 19% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, or 22% measured in constant currency, as detailed in the tables below.
Strong execution, industry leading solutions and our ability to deliver a compelling ROI to our customers, all contributed to continued momentum and strong third quarter revenue growth in the face of a challenging global economic environment. Red Hat is benefiting from our position as a trusted vendor for IT, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. Since October of last year we have completed three acquisitions, and are announcing a fourth today to expand our portfolio of open source solutions and enlarge our addressable market. As our enterprise customers move to open, hybrid cloud architectures, we are addressing their needs with a clear roadmap based on industry-leading open source technologies.
GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $49.9 million, down 7% year-over-year, due largely to acquisition-related costs, including stock compensation and amortization. GAAP operating margin was 14.5%. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter was $82.5 million, up 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.0%.
Net income for the quarter was $34.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with $38.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. After adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $56.9 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, as compared to $55.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter.
Operating cash flow was $100.2 million for the third quarter, as compared to $96.6 million in the year ago quarter. At quarter end, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $987.7 million, an increase of 21% on a year-over-year basis. Total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of November 30, 2012 were $1.35 billion.
While we continue to increase investments in new technologies and growth initiatives, our solid performance is driving steady profitability and strong operating cash flow. In Q3, we used our strong balance sheet and cash flow to repurchase approximately $52 million of common stock, in addition to closing the FuseSource acquisition which enhances our offering in the fast-growing Application Integration software space. stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat.

Item 2.02.         Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 27, 2013, Red Hat, Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
In the press release, we disclosed non-GAAP financial information for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 and February 29, 2012. These non-GAAP disclosures include non-GAAP revenue growth rates measured on a constant currency basis and a reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income based on:
the impact of non-cash share-based compensation expense under FASB ASC Section 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share-Based Payment) ("ASC 718");
the impact of expense associated with the amortization of intangible assets primarily related to business combinations; and
the impact of a charge recorded in connection with subleasing and exiting one of the Companys facilities located in Raleigh, NC (the Facility Exit).
These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results, but rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we disclosed and the methods we used to calculate non-GAAP results are not in accordance with GAAP and may be materially different from the non-GAAP measures and methods used by other companies.
We disclosed non-GAAP revenue growth rates for subscription revenue and total revenue measured on a constant currency basis for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, in an effort to provide a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed when compared to the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012.   Approximately 43.8%  and 43.3% of our revenue for the three months and fiscal year, respectively, ended February 28, 2013 was produced by sales outside the United States. The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for each month in an applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies results in increased revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, revenue, as stated in U.S. dollars, for our non-U.S. operations decreases if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies.  Using the average foreign currency exchange rates for each month of the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, our subscription revenue for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013 would have been higher than we reported by $3.0 million and $28.2 million, respectively, and our total revenue for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, would have been higher than we reported by $3.3 million and $32.9 million, respectively.
We excluded GAAP share-based compensation expense for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP adjusted net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income per share because it is a non-cash expense which may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes not directly or immediately related to the particular periods operational performance. For example, the amount recognized for share-based awards is directly related to the underlying share price of our common stock as of the date of grant, which, in the short-term, may not be directly related to our operational performance. Consequently, management believes that by excluding such expense we provide an alternative and useful measure of operating performance.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude share-based compensation expense are used by a number of financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.     Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash, share-based compensation expense of $26.0 million and $98.7 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, and $23.6 million and $79.3 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets results primarily from business combinations.  These costs are fixed in connection with an acquisition, are then amortized over a number of years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition.  Accordingly, management generally does not consider such costs for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the business or its managers or when making decisions to allocate resources.  Management also believes that non-GAAP measures of profitability that exclude amortization expense related to intangible assets are used by a number of  financial analysts in the software industry to compare current performance to prior periods and to forecast future performance.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP non-cash amortization expense of $7.3 million and $23.5 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, and $5.1 million and $19.7 million for the three months and fiscal year ended February 29, 2012, respectively, versus the non-GAAP exclusion of such expense.
We also excluded GAAP expense relating to a charge we recorded in connection with the Facility Exit.  Our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income includes GAAP expense of $3.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013.
Management believes that these adjusted non-GAAP results, when read in conjunction with the GAAP results, offer a useful view of our business performance in that they provide a more consistent means of comparing performance to prior periods in light of the effect of exchange rate differences, potential variations in the amount of expense for share-based awards recognized from period to period due to changes in the price of our common stock, the irregularity with which management acquires intangible assets and the non-recurring nature of the expense we recognized in connection with the Facility Exit. Management also uses non-GAAP measures as a component of its regular internal reporting to evaluate performance of the business and compare it to prior performance, to make operating decisions, including internal budgeting and the calculation of incentive compensation, and to forecast future performance. Our disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance using information used by management.

Red Hat Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2013 Result
s
Fourth quarter revenue of $348 million, up 17% year-over-year; full fiscal year revenue of $1.33 billion, up 17% year-over-year
Fourth quarter subscription revenue of $303 million, up 19% year-over-year; full fiscal year subscription revenue of $1.15 billion, up 19% year-over-year
Fourth quarter operating cash flow of $137 million, up 7% year-over-year; full fiscal year operating cash flow of $465 million, up 19% year-over-year
Year-end deferred revenue balance exceeds a billion dollars, up 15% year-over-year
RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 27, 2013--Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2013.
Total revenue for the quarter was $348 million, an increase of 17% in U.S. dollars from the year ago quarter, or 18% measured in constant currency. Constant currency references in this release are as detailed in the tables below. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $303 million, up 19% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, or 20% measured in constant currency. For the full fiscal year 2013, total revenue was $1.33 billion, up 17% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, or 20% measured in constant currency, and subscription revenue was $1.15 billion, up 19% in U.S. dollars year-over-year, or 22% measured in constant currency.
For FY13, the growth drivers in our business remained intact, driving record annual revenue, billings proxy and total backlog up 17%, 14% and over 19% year-over-year, respectively. Within total backlog, the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future and not reflected in our financial statements increased to over $280 million, or up over 40%, as customers increased their commitments to Red Hat technologies in the data center, stated Jim Whitehurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Red Hat. We continued to see momentum with large deals in Q4, closing a record number of deals in excess of $5 million and $10 million. We now provide solutions to over 90% of Fortune 500 companies as well as tens of thousands of smaller companies. New customer additions coupled with renewing and up-selling our existing customer base enabled us to exceed the billion dollar milestone in both subscription revenue and deferred revenues for the first time.
GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2013 was $50 million and $201 million, respectively. GAAP operating margin was 14.4% in the fourth quarter and 15.1% for the full year. After adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses and certain facility exit costs, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $84 million, or a 24.0% operating margin. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $326 million and full year non-GAAP operating margin was 24.6%.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $43 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared with $35 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $36 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter was $70 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, after adjusting for stock compensation and amortization expenses, as detailed in the tables below. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $57 million, or $0.29 per diluted share in the prior quarter, and $57 million, or $0.29 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP results for the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter benefited by approximately $0.03 per share as a result of the retroactive reinstatement in January 2013 of the U.S. research tax credit.
For the full year, GAAP net income was $150 million or $0.77 per diluted share, compared with $147 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the prior year. After adjusting for stock compensation, amortization expenses and certain facility exit costs, as detailed in the tables below, non-GAAP adjusted net income for the year was $240 million or $1.23 per diluted share, compared to $216 million or $1.10 per diluted share for the previous fiscal year.
Operating cash flow totaled $137 million for the fourth quarter and $465 million for the full year. At the end of the fiscal year, the companys total deferred revenue balance was $1.09 billion, an increase of 15% on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Cash and investments at February 28, 2013 totaled $1.32 billion after repurchasing approximately 687 thousand shares of common stock in the fourth quarter for approximately $36 million. For fiscal year 2013, Red Hat repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares, or approximately $121 million of common stock.
During fiscal year 2013, we invested aggressively in new product areas such as storage, cloud computing, management and big data through new internal initiatives and three acquisitions in the second half of the fiscal year. Despite these investments, we generated over 9% year-over-year growth in non-GAAP operating income and 19% full year operating cash flow growth, stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat. These investments enhance our strategic position in the data center and increase our addressable market.
The billings proxy, which we define as total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue as reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, was $1.49 billion for the fiscal year 2013 compared with $1.31 billion for the prior fiscal year, an increase of 14%. Total backlog for fiscal year 2013 was in excess of $1.37 billion or up over 19% year-over-year. We define total backlog as the value of non-cancellable subscription and service contracts, including total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of customer contracts to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements was in excess of $280 million as of February 28, 2013, compared with in excess of $200 million for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2012, up over 40% year-over-year.

A live webcast of Red Hat's results will begin at 5:00 pm ET today and can be accessed by the general public at Red Hat's investor relations website at .

Exhibit 99.1
 
  Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of Red Hat's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Raleigh, N.C.
April 15, 2013
The new program replaces the previous $300 million repurchase program, the final $179 million of which was completed since February 28, 2013 at an average price of $49.15 per share, inclusive of commissions, for a total of 3.6 million shares. "Over the last 13 months we have repurchased $300 million or 5.9 million shares of Red Hat common stock under the current program, equivalent to 3% of our shares outstanding as of February 28, 2013," stated Charlie Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Red Hat.

Repurchases of common stock may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when Red Hat might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

Executive Base Salaries
The annual base salaries for the Executive Officers are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Form 8-K"). The Committee decided to maintain base salaries for FY2014 at the levels approved during the Company's fiscal year ending February 28, 2013.
FY2014 Target Award Amounts under the EVCP
The target award amounts under the EVCP for FY2014 for the Executive Officers are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 16, 2007 (the "May 2007 Form 8-K").
FY2014 Performance Objectives under the EVCP
The financial performance objectives for FY2014 under the EVCP are (a) a specified dollar amount of total revenues, (b) a specified dollar amount of cash flow from operations plus excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements and (c) a specified percentage of operating margin, excluding the impact of expense related to share-based payment arrangements. the amortization of intangible assets and facilities exit costs. The cash flow from operations and operating margin performance objectives are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
The total revenue and operating margin performance objectives are based on a Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.00 Euros: U.S.$1.29 and a yen/ U.S. dollar exchange rate of 94 yen:U.S.$1.00, and these objectives are subject to adjustment if actual exchange rates for these currencies differ from these assumed rates by 5% or more. Additionally, the following items shall be excluded in determining whether any financial performance objective has been satisfied for FY2014: the impact of acquisitions and divestitures approved by the Board of Directors, goodwill write-offs, restructuring charges, litigation and insurance settlement charges, the impact of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in tax laws or accounting procedures. The Committee has reserved the right to exercise negative discretion to limit or forego any of these exclusions and may adjust any financial performance objective for FY2014 in its discretion as permitted by Section VIII of the EVCP. For a discussion of the EVCP, see the May 2007 Form 8-K.
The Committee determined that 75% of a participant's target award amount will be based upon the financial performance objectives discussed above, and 25% of a participant's target award amount will be based on individual performance objectives or the achievement of individual goals, which may be objectively or subjectively determined (the "Individual Objectives"). Individual
Objectives relate to strategy development, planning and/or implementation, corporate initiatives, succession planning, retention of key employees, executive development and operational improvements. The Committee determined that each of the financial performance objectives discussed above will be weighted equally in calculating the financial component of the award, and, with respect to each financial metric and the Individual Objectives metric, payments range from 0  50% per metric. The target award amounts approved by the Committee for the Executive Officers are set forth on Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K.
Operating PSUs and the Form of Operating PSU Agreement
The Committee authorized the grant to each Executive Officer of an Operating PSU award. Each Operating PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the form of Operating PSU agreement (the "Operating PSU Agreement") filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the Operating PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the Operating PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 15, 2007 (the "October 2007 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the October 2007 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the Operating PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of PSUs, and depending on the Company's financial performance, the executive may earn up to 200% of the target number of PSUs (the "Maximum PSUs") over a period with two separate performance segments. The first segment measures performance at the end of the second fiscal year within the Performance Period against performance in the Base Year. The second segment measures performance at the end of the third fiscal year of the Performance Period against performance in the Base Year. Up to 50% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the first performance segment and up to 100% of the Maximum PSUs may be earned in respect of the second performance segment, less the amount earned in respect of the first performance segment.
The number of PSUs earned, according to the specified formula in the Operating Performance PSU Agreement, will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each performance segment ending during the Performance Period with respect to Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth (the "Performance Goals") as compared to the performance of specified peer companies during each performance segment of the Operating Performance Period with respect to the same Performance Goals.
If the executive's continuous service with the Company or any of its affiliates as an employee, consultant or director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, any then unearned PSUs will be forfeited; provided, however, if the executive's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability or by reason of the Company's termination of the executive without Good Cause, he or she will be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned PSUs for the performance segment in which the Business Relationship ceased.
If a Change in Control occurs, and provided the executive's Business Relationship has not ceased, the Committee may determine that either (i) all of the shares underlying the award that have not previously been paid or earned will be treated as earned (x) to the Target Performance Share Unit level if the Change in Control occurs during the first two fiscal years of the Performance Period or (y) based on the Company's performance as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter before the date that the Change in Control occurs if the Change in Control occurs during the third fiscal year in the Performance Period, and will be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control, or (ii) the Operating Performance PSUs will be "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for" immediately following a Change in Control, using restricted stock of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation.
The foregoing description of the terms of the Operating PSU awards and the Operating PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of Operating PSU Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K.
TSR PSUs and the Form of TSR PSU Agreement
The Committee authorized the grant to each Executive Officer of a TSR PSU award. Each TSR PSU represents the right to receive in the future one share of the Company's common stock, or at the Company's election, the value of such share, according to a formula specified in, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the form of TSR PSU agreement (the "TSR PSU Agreement") filed as Exhibit 99.3 hereto. Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the TSR PSU Agreement.
Except as set forth below, the terms of the TSR PSU Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's form of Performance Share Unit Agreement (Fiscal Year 2010  SPP Form) filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 29, 2009 (the "June 2009 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the June 2009 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
Under the TSR PSU Agreement, an executive will be granted an award for a target number of PSUs, and depending on the Company's TSR performance over a thirty-six month period (the "TSR Performance Period"), the executive may earn up to 200% of the target number of PSUs. The number of PSUs earned, according to the formula specified in the TSR PSU Agreement, will be determined based on Red Hat's TSR performance measured against the TSR of specified peer companies during the TSR Performance Period. Stock price performance is measured by the change in the average price of common stock calculated over the ninety-day periods ending at both the beginning and the end of the TSR Performance Period. TSR is determined by measuring stock price performance plus any cash dividends payable with respect to a record date set, and not rescinded, within the TSR Performance Period.
If the executive's Business Relationship ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, any then unearned PSUs will be forfeited; provided, however, if the executive's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability or by reason of the Company's termination of the executive without Good Cause, he or she will be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned PSUs for the Performance Period.
If a Change in Control occurs, and provided the executive's Business Relationship has not ceased, the Committee may determine that either (i) all of the shares underlying the award that have not previously been paid or earned will be treated as earned based on the Relative TSR Performance as of the date that the Change in Control occurs using the per share equivalent of the cash consideration and securities paid or payable to the Company or its stockholders in connection with the Change in Control as the Average Closing Price, and will be paid out in a single lump sum within 30 days following the Change in Control, or (ii) the TSR PSUs will be "continued, assumed, converted or substituted for" immediately following a Change in Control, using restricted stock of the Company, Parent Corporation or Surviving Corporation.
The foregoing description of the terms of the TSR PSU awards and the TSR PSU Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of TSR PSU Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.
Peer Group
The Peer Group approved by the Committee to be used to measure performance in the award agreements for each of the Operating PSU and the TSR PSU awards in FY2014 is set forth on Exhibit 99.4 to this Form 8-K.
RSAs and the Form of RSA Agreement
The Committee authorized the grant to each Executive Officer of a RSA award, subject to the terms and conditions of, the form of RSA Agreement (the "RSA Agreement") filed as Exhibit 99.5 hereto. An executive's right to receive the shares subject to a RSA award is subject to achievement of a specified dollar amount of revenues established by the Committee as the performance objective for FY2014 under the Company's 2011 Performance Compensation Plan (the "RSA Performance Goal"). Except as set forth below, the terms of the RSA Agreement are substantially similar to the terms of the Company's Performance RSA Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.4 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 25, 2010 (the "May 2010 Form 8-K"). The summary of such terms in the May 2010 Form 8-K is incorporated by reference herein.
If the Company fails to achieve the RSA Performance Goal for FY2014, then all shares of restricted stock subject to the award are forfeited. If the Company achieves the Performance Goal for FY2014, 25% of the restricted stock vests on July 16, 2014, and the remainder vests ratably on a quarterly basis over the course of the subsequent threeyear period, provided that the executive's Business Relationship with Red Hat has not ceased.
Capitalized terms not defined in this summary are defined in the form of RSA award agreement filed as Exhibit 99.5 to this Form 8-K. The foregoing description of the terms of the RSA Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the form of RSA Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.5 to this Form 8-K and incorporated by reference herein.

1. .
Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares". The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration.
The Performance Period consists of two separate performance segments for which performance goals are measured. The first segment measures performance at the end of the second fiscal year within the Performance Period against performance in the Base Year. The second segment measures performance at the end of the third fiscal year of the Performance Period against performance in the Base Year. The Performance Share Units earned during each of the segments are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the Company's financial performance as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the number of Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during each performance segment with respect to the performance goals set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that performance segment with respect to the same performance goals, all as further described herein. For the avoidance of doubt, no more than the number of Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned under this Award.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goals are Percentage Revenue Growth and Percentage Operating Income Growth. For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goals
(i) "Base Fiscal Year" for each member ("Peer") of the Peer Group and for the Company (each, an "Entity") means its full fiscal year that ends immediately before the beginning of the Performance Period;
(ii) "Operating Income" means operating income, excluding unusual or non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of changes in applicable tax and accounting rules only (A) if and
 
(Form of Operating PSU Agreement May 2013)
 
to the extent any such item is separately disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes and (B) in a manner consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, except as otherwise determined by the Committee;
(iii) "First Measuring Segment" for each Entity means its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the Company's second fiscal year within the Performance Period;
(iv) "Second Measuring Segment" for each Entity means its full fiscal year that ends with or immediately precedes the end of the Company's third fiscal year within the Performance Period;
(v) "Percentage Operating Income Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Operating Income for such Entity's First or Second Measuring Segment, as applicable, and (y) Operating Income for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year, by (B) the amount in clause (y);
(vi) "Percentage Revenue Growth" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the difference between (x) Revenue for such Entity's First or Second Measuring Segment, as applicable, and (y) Revenue for such Entity's Base Fiscal Year by (B) the amount in clause (y); and
(vii) "Revenue" means gross revenue as such item is disclosed in the applicable Entity's consolidated income statement and attendant footnotes.
The elements of each performance goal shall be as identified in the financial statements, notes to the financial statements, management's discussions and analysis, or other filings of the applicable Entity with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(b) . The Peer Group consists of the companies listed on Appendix B: (each individually, a "Peer"). If any Peer ceases to be a public company during any applicable Measuring Segment (whether by acquisition, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Peer shall be treated as if it were not a Peer for such Measuring Segment and the remaining Measuring Segment (if any) in the Performance Period. If any Peer fails to file its annual audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission by April 15 following the end of the applicable Measuring Segment, it shall be treated as if it was not a Peer for such Measuring Segment.
Peer Group
[insert peer group as adopted by Compensation Committee]
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of each Measuring Segment in the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to each of the Performance Goals shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to each Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group and listed in descending order of Percentage Revenue Growth or Percentage Operating Income Growth, whichever is being measured in respect of such Measuring Segment (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal calculated in respect of a
Determining Company Performance
 
(Form of Operating PSU Agreement May 2013)
 
Measuring Segment then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for such Measuring Segment plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for a Measuring Segment then the number for this purpose would be 17). The percentile rank for each Performance Goal shall then be averaged, taking each into account equally (resulting in the "Average Percentile Rank").
(ii) . Up to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the first performance segment in the performance period; and up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Maximum Performance Share Units may be earned in respect of the second performance segment in the Performance Period (less amounts earned in the first performance segment).
Maximum Performance Share Units Earned
(iii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be calculated by multiplying (a) times (b), and that product times (c), and that product less (d), where (a) is the payout percentage as determined under the following table based on the Company's Average Percentile Rank calculated in respect of a performance segment, (b) is the maximum percentage of the Maximum Performance Share Units that may be earned as determined pursuant to Subparagraph 3(c)(ii) in respect of the performance segment in question, (c) is the number of Target Performance Share Units, and (d) is the number of Performance Share Units earned in respect of the first performance segment. The number of Shares distributed will equal the number of Performance Share Units earned under this provision.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the Average Percentile Rank for each Measuring Segment shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the Average Percentile Rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of service will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section 4 or .
Continuous Service Relationship
Appendix A
 
(Form of Operating PSU Agreement May 2013)
 
The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate. For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the performance segment in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such performance segment prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank in respect of such performance segment. Any Shares in respect of Performance Share Units earned pursuant to the previous sentence shall be paid to the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) at the same time that the Shares are delivered to other holders of this type of Award for the applicable performance segment in which the cessation of Business Relationship occurs, which timing shall be pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in ), the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the performance segment in which the Business Relationship ceased, based on the number of days elapsed in such performance segment prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's Average Percentile Rank in respect of such performance segment. Any Shares in respect of Performance Share Units earned pursuant to the previous sentence shall be paid to the Participant at the same time that the Shares are delivered to other holders of this type of Award for the applicable performance segment in which the cessation of Business Relationship occurs, which timing shall be pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's
 
(Form of Operating PSU Agreement May 2013)
 
determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, with respect to which the Performance Share Units were earned, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the most recent preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof. If the Company elects to deliver cash to the Participant, the Company is authorized to retain such amount as is sufficient to satisfy the withholding of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof).
 
(Form of Operating PSU Agreement May 2013)
 
7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.
No Obligation to Continue Business Relationship
9. . The Performance Share Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver Shares or the value thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Performance Share Units. The Participant shall have no right to vote or receive dividends with respect to any Shares underlying the Performance Share Units unless and until such Shares are distributed to the Participant or converted into Restricted Stock as provided in .
No Rights as Stockholder
Appendix A
10. . The Plan contains provisions covering the treatment of Performance Share Units (and Restricted Stock) in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for such adjustments are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference.
Adjustments for Capital Changes
 
 
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
 
(Form of Operating PSU Agreement May 2013)
 
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the most recent preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.

Grant of Performance Share Units
The Award is granted pursuant to and is subject to and governed by the Plan and the terms of this Agreement. Unless otherwise defined in this Agreement, capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as in the Plan. The shares of Common Stock that are issuable after the Performance Share Units have been earned are referred to in this Agreement as "Shares." The Performance Share Units shall be granted to the Participant without payment of consideration.
The Performance Period consists of one performance segment corresponding to the thirty-six month period that begins on the first day of the Performance Period. The Performance Share Units earned during the Performance Period are intended to qualify as performance based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the "Code") and this Agreement shall be administered and construed by the Committee in accordance with such intention. The Performance Period will be shortened in the event of an intervening Acquisition or the death or Disability (as defined below ) of the Participant, as provided for under the terms of this Agreement, including Appendix A.
2. .
Range of Earned Performance Share Units
Depending on the performance of the Company's common stock relative to the Peer Group (as defined below) as provided in Section 3, the Participant may earn up to the number of Performance Share Units (between zero and 200% of the Target Performance Share Units). The number of Performance Share Units earned will be determined based on a comparison of the Company's performance during the Performance Period with respect to the performance goal set forth in Section 3 to the performance of the peer group companies (the "Peer Group") designated in Section 3 during that Performance Period with respect to the same performance goal, as further described herein.
3. .
Determination of Earned Performance Share Units
(a) . The performance goal is TSR Performance relative to the Peer Group ("Relative TSR Performance"). For purposes of this Agreement:
Performance Goal
 
(i) "Acquisition" means an event that constitutes a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) under clauses (ii) or (iii) of that definition.
(ii) "Acquisition Price" means the per share equivalent on a fully diluted basis, assuming exercise of all outstanding options, of the cash consideration and securities paid or payable to the Company or its equity owners at the closing of an Acquisition, with any securities that are not then publicly traded being valued by the Company's Board.
(iii) "Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of the Company's common stock on a U.S. national securities exchange on which such stock principally trades for each trading day during the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period (for purposes of this determination, the Average Closing Price shall be rounded to two decimal points), taking into account any adjustment under Section 12.2 of the Plan; , , that if the Company has an Acquisition, the "Average Closing Price" means the Acquisition Price. For purposes of clarity, Average Closing Price is determined separately for each of the First Measurement Period and the Second Measurement Period.
provided
however
(iv) "Entity" means each of (x) a member of the Peer Group and (y) the Company;
(v) "First Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the period of ninety trading days ending on the first day of the Performance Period;
(vi) "Second Measurement Period" means, for each Entity, the period of ninety trading days ending on the last day of the Performance Period.
(vii) "TSR Performance" for each Entity is determined by dividing (A) the (x) difference between (i) the Average Closing Price during the Second Measurement Period (or, as applicable, the Acquisition Price and (ii) the Average Closing Price during the First Measurement Period plus (y) any cash dividend payable with respect to a record date set, and not rescinded, within the Performance Period by (B) the amount in clause (ii); and
(b) . The Peer Group consists of the companies listed on . If any member of the Peer Group ceases to be a public company during the Performance Period (whether by acquisition,
Peer Group
Appendix B
[insert peer group as adopted by Compensation Committee]
 
merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise), such Member shall be treated as if it were not a member of the Peer Group for the Performance Period.
(c) .
Earned Performance Share Units
(i) . Following the end of the Performance Period, the Company's performance with respect to the Performance Goal shall be compared to that of the Peer Group. The Company's percentile rank with respect to the Performance Goal shall be equal to the result of dividing (a) by (b), where (a) is the number corresponding to the Company's numerical rank in the group consisting of the Company and the Peer Group (e.g., if the Company ranks seventh with respect to the Performance Goal for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 7), and (b) is the number equal to the number of companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period plus one (e.g., if there are 16 companies in the Peer Group for the Performance Period then the number for this purpose would be 17).
Determining Company Performance
(ii) . The number of earned Performance Share Units shall be determined under the following table based on the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Determining Performance Share Units Earned
 
For purposes of this determination, the percentile rank for the Performance Period shall be rounded to three decimal points. If the percentile rank is between two stated percentages above, the Payout Percentage will be prorated accordingly.
4. .
Cessation of Business Relationship
(a) . If the Participant's continuous service to the Company or one of its Affiliates as an Employee or Director (a "Business Relationship") ceases for any reason prior to the last day of the Performance Period, the Performance Share Units that were not earned as of the date of such cessation of Business Relationship will be forfeited, except as provided in this Section 4 or . The Participant's Business Relationship shall be deemed to have ceased on the last day of active service to the Company or an Affiliate.
Continuous Service Relationship
Appendix A
 
For purposes hereof, a Business Relationship may not be considered as having ceased during any leave of absence, at the discretion of the Committee, if such leave of absence has been approved in writing by the Company. Any change in the type of Business Relationship the Participant has within or among the Company and its Affiliates shall not result in the forfeiture of the Performance Share Units so long as the Participant continuously maintains a Business Relationship.
(b) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of death or Disability, the Participant (or the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the Performance Share Units for the Performance Period (as shortened by the death or Disability), based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period.
Death or Disability
(c) . In the event the Participant's Business Relationship ceases by reason of the Company's termination of the Participant without Good Cause (as defined in , the Participant shall be entitled to payment of a pro rata portion of the earned Performance Share Units for the Performance Period, based on the number of days elapsed in the original 36-month Performance Period prior to the cessation of the Business Relationship and the Company's percentile rank for the Performance Period. Any Shares in respect of Performance Share Units earned pursuant to the previous sentence shall be paid to the Participant at the same time that the Shares are delivered to other holders of this type of Award, which timing shall be pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Cessation without Good Cause
Appendix A)
(d) . For purposes of this Section:
Definitions
(i) "Beneficiary" shall mean the last person or persons designated by the Participant as his or her beneficiary in writing prior to the Participant's death. If no such person survives the Participant, the Beneficiary shall be the Participant's estate.
(ii) "Disability" shall mean that as a result of accidental bodily injury, sickness, mental illness, substance abuse or pregnancy, the Participant is expected for a period of twenty-four (24) months thereafter (i) to be prevented from performing one or more of the essential duties of the Participant's occupation, (ii) to have monthly earnings of less than eighty percent (80%) of the Participant's pre-Disability earnings, and (iii) to be under the regular care of a physician. For purposes of this Agreement a duty is essential if it is substantial, not incidental, is fundamental or inherent to the Participant's occupation and cannot be reasonably omitted or changed; to be at work for the number of hours in the Participant's regularly scheduled work week is also an essential duty. The Committee may require such proof of Disability as the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion deems appropriate and the Committee's determination as to whether the Participant has incurred a Disability shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.
 
5. .
Payment
(a) Within 60 days following the Committee's certification in writing of the Performance Share Units earned, but in no event later than the 15
th
day of the third month of the year following the later of the calendar year or the Company's taxable year, in each case, in which falls the end of the Performance Period, the Company shall distribute to the Participant (or to the Participant's Beneficiary in the event of death) the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock as defined in ) that were earned (or vested in the case of Restricted Stock), reduced by the number of Shares (if any) that are withheld from the Award for the payment of Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 12 hereof) and upon the satisfaction of all other applicable conditions as to the Performance Share Units; provided, however, that the Shares may be distributed following the date contemplated in this Section to the extent permitted under Section 409A of the Code without the payment becoming subject to, and being treated as "nonqualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (such as where the Company reasonably anticipates that the payment will violate federal securities laws or other applicable laws). Payment of any earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be made in whole Shares. Earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, and the Company shall pay the value of any fractional Shares to the Participant in cash on the basis of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of distribution.
Appendix A
(b) The Company shall not be obligated to issue Shares to the Participant upon the earning of any Performance Share Units (or vesting of any Restricted Stock or otherwise) unless the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with all relevant provisions of law and other legal requirements including, without limitation, any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, any applicable Tax-Related Items and the requirements of any stock exchange upon which Shares may be listed.
(c) Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, Performance Share Units granted under this Agreement may be suspended, delayed or otherwise deferred for any of the reasons contemplated in Sections 4 and 5 only to the extent such suspension, delay or deferral is permitted under U.S. Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(7), 1.409A-1(b)(4)(ii) or successor provisions, or as otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code.
6. .
Option of Company to Deliver Cash
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the time when any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) are payable pursuant to Sections 5 or 11, the Company may elect, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to deliver to the Participant in lieu of the Shares represented by Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) that are then payable an equivalent amount of cash (determined by reference to the closing price of the Shares on the principal exchange on which the Shares trade on the applicable payment date or if such date is not a trading date, on the most recent preceding trading date). Such payments shall be made no later than the deadline set forth in Section 5(a) hereof.

7. .
Restrictions on Transfer
(a) The Participant shall not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock), either voluntarily or by operation of law. Any attempt to dispose of any Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) in contravention of the above restriction shall be null and void and without effect.
(b) The Company shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any of the Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) which have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions set forth herein or (ii) to treat as the owner of such Performance Share Units (or Restricted Stock) any transferee to whom such Performance Share Units have been transferred in violation of any of the provisions contained herein.
8. . Neither the Plan, this Agreement, nor the grant of the Performance Share Units imposes any obligation on the Company or its Affiliates to have or continue a Business Relationship with the Participant.

Withholding Taxes
(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Affiliate employing the Participant (the "Employer") take with respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local tax and/or non-U.S. tax), social insurance, payroll tax or other tax-related items ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant with respect to the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units, or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Performance Share Units, including the award of the Performance Share Units, the earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), the issuance
 
of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of the Performance Share Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired at earning and the receipt of any dividends and or Dividend Equivalents; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the Award or any aspect of the Performance Share Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
(b) Prior to the relevant tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all withholding obligations of the Company and/or the Employer with respect to Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant hereby authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, in their sole discretion and without any notice to or authorization by the Participant, to withhold from the Shares being distributed under this Award upon the determination of earned Performance Share Units that number of whole Shares the fair market value of which (determined by reference to the closing price of the Common Stock on the principal exchange on which the Common Stock trades on the date the withholding obligation arises, or if such date is not a trading date, on the most recent preceding trading date) is equal to the aggregate withholding obligation as determined by the Company and/or Employer with respect to such Award, provided that the Company only withholds the number of Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding obligation amount. If the Company satisfies the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items by withholding a number of Shares being distributed under the Award as described above, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the Award of Performance Share Units (or the Restricted Stock), notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of the Award, earning and/or settlement of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock). In the event the Tax-Related Items withholding obligation would result in a fractional number of Shares to be withheld by the Company, such number of Shares to be withheld shall be rounded up to the next nearest number of whole Shares. If, solely due to rounding of Shares, the value of the number of Shares retained by the Company pursuant to this provision is more than the amount required to be withheld, then the Company may pay such excess amount to the relevant tax authority as additional withholding with respect to the Participant.
(c) Alternatively, or in addition, the Company may (i) only to the extent and in the manner permitted by all applicable securities laws, including making any necessary securities registration or taking any other necessary actions, instruct the broker whom it has selected for this purpose to sell on the Participant's behalf, the Shares to be issued upon the earning or settlement, as applicable, of the Participant's Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock) to meet the withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items, and/or (ii) withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by Participant from Participant's wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer.
(d) Finally, the Participant hereby acknowledges that the Participant is required to pay to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's Award of Performance Share Units, earning of the Performance Share Units (or vesting of Restricted Stock), or the issuance of Shares (or payment of cash) in settlement of earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Participant hereby acknowledges that the
 
Company may refuse to deliver the Shares in settlement of the earned Performance Share Units (or vested Restricted Stock) to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant's obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described in this Section. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any Shares that are retained by the Company pursuant to this provision, and under no circumstances will the Company be required to issue any fractional Shares.
