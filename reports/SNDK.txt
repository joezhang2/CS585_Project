SUNNYVALE, CA, July 17, 2002 . . . SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash memory data storage products, today announced results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2002. Total second quarter revenues were $127.7 million, compared to $92.6 million in the first quarter of 2002. Product revenues were $115.7 million, up 34% from the prior quarter. Second quarter revenues from licenses and royalties were $12.0 million, up from $6.2 million in the prior quarter. Second quarter net income was $9.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share compared to a net loss in the first quarter of $3.7 million, or negative $0.05 per share on a diluted basis.
 
Product gross margin for the second quarter was 27% compared to 6% in the first quarter of 2002. Average selling price per megabyte declined by 8% in the second quarter, compared to a 15% decline in the first quarter. Second quarter total units sold increased 37% and megabytes sold increased 48% compared to the previous quarter, both representing new record levels.
 
Total second quarter revenues increased 19% from $107.1 million in the second quarter of 2001. Product revenues increased 31% from $88.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Revenues from licenses and royalties decreased $7.0 million from $19.0 million in the second quarter of 2001. The second quarter 2002 net income of $9.0 million compares to a net loss of $10.0 million, or negative $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2001.
 
"We are very pleased with SanDisk's strong performance in the second quarter, our first profitable quarter from operations in six quarters," said Dr. Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk. "In the second quarter, we experienced surprisingly strong growth in our global retail and consumer OEM sales, as demonstrated by the record number of units and megabytes sold during the quarter. The strong demand for our products was accompanied by relatively stable pricing, due primarily to a good balance between demand and supply of flash memory. Product gross margins improved dramatically due to a combination of factors including our transition from wafers produced in Virginia to lower cost wafers produced by Toshiba's Yokkaichi foundry, increased contributions from MLC (Multi Level Cell) production output with our 1 Gigabit chip, significantly lower overhead expenses due to our restructuring activities in 2001, and the sale of $5.3 million of NOR flash inventory that was previously written off. Income from royalties was higher than expected due to higher sales by our licensees.
 
"New orders from OEM customers and industrial distributors are trending up. Retail continues to be a turns business, with most of the current quarter's projected sales yet to be booked. The digital consumer electronic markets that we address are continuing to experience steady growth, in particular digital cameras, digital camcorders, PDA's and smart phones. As the installed base for these products becomes larger, so does our opportunity to sell additional cards in the retail aftermarket. We expanded our product offerings in the retail channel with first production shipments of our Cruzer
personal storage device late in the quarter.
 
"The consolidation of our FlashVision joint venture production at Toshiba's Yokkaichi fabrication facility in Japan is proceeding on plan. New production at the FlashVision joint venture in Japan is projected to start late in the third quarter and pick up in the fourth quarter, in time for the anticipated pickup in demand for the Holiday season sales.
 
"Given the traditionally slow retail sales in July and August and our limited bookings visibility, and given our flash memory supply constraints until late in the quarter, we are forecasting product revenues in the third quarter to be slightly higher than in the second quarter and royalties to be approximately $8.0 million. We believe product gross margins should improve modestly relative to the second quarter as the percentage of shipments of the more cost effective MLC products continues to increase. We are cautiously optimistic about a stronger fourth quarter, particularly in our retail channel.
 
"As previously reported, we are engaged in a number of patent lawsuits with different companies. We expect our legal expenses to increase significantly in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 due to these lawsuits."
 
This news release contains certain forward looking statements including our expectations for future product revenues and bookings, earnings and profitability, product demand, average selling prices, and gross margins that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: future average selling price erosion due to excess industry capacity and extreme price competition; increased expenses and fluctuations in operating results and yields related to the startup of flash memory wafer production for FlashVision at the Yokkaichi foundry in Japan; potential delays in starting up production of NAND flash memory wafers at the FlashVision joint venture at Yokkaichi which may reduce our available supply of flash memory and cause us to not be able to meet customer demand for our flash products; our increased exposure to interruption of supply due to our increased dependence on a geographic sole source at Yokkaichi for our supply of NAND flash memory; the current global economic conditions in general and in our markets in particular; the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products based on the 1 Gigabit NAND MLC (Multilevel cell) .16 and .13 micron flash chips that SanDisk is obligated to purchase from FlashVision; fluctuations in royalty revenues due to industry wide changes in demand for flash memory products which impact royalty bearing sales of our licensees; the timely introduction and acceptance of new consumer products that incorporate our flash storage devices; slower than expected growth in the emerging markets for our products which may result in reduced sales and increased inventory; successful management of assembly operations in China and Taiwan; the unknown economic impact of past terrorist attacks and the military response thereto; seasonality of product sales; market acceptance of our Secure Digital, Cruzer, Memory Stick and Ultra CompactFlash card products; our ability to prevail in patent litigation proceedings which, if we fail to win, may result in reduced future royalty income, increased legal expenses, and potential interruption of sales of certain of our products in certain geographic markets; and the other risks detailed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, the Form 10Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We assume no obligation to update the information contained in this release.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) announced today that they have signed cross license and supply agreements covering flash memory technology. With these agreements, both companies have dismissed lawsuits that they had filed earlier against each other in California and Texas courts. A previous patent cross-licensing agreement between Samsung and SanDisk expired this month. The new agreements have a term of seven years.
SUNNYVALE, CA, Aug. 19, 2002
 
Under the agreements, Samsung and SanDisk will be cross-licensed to the flash memory and card patents of both companies. Samsung will also supply SanDisk with flash memory products for the next seven years. Both the license and supply agreements cover MLC (multi-level cell) patents and products. Other details of the agreement were not disclosed.
 
Y.W. Lee, CEO and president of Samsung Electronics, said, "With these agreements in place, the two companies bring a stronger and a more stable flash future for the end users. In particular, SanDisk brings leadership and many years of valuable experiences in the MLC technology and flash application areas. Samsung on the other hand has made critical breakthroughs in the NAND flash technology areas. In combination, the two sides now have the necessary foundation to raise the state of current flash technologies and assure that the anticipated increase in global demand for flash memory products, both in terms of volume and performance, will be satisfied."
 
Eli Harari, CEO and president of SanDisk, said, "These new licensing and supply agreements are very good and fair agreements to both our companies. The license agreement continues under the terms of the first license agreement that has just expired and expands the scope of the license to include the future right to sell flash products incorporating MLC patents. The supply agreement covers the supply of standard flash as well as the future supply of MLC flash. This supply agreement represents welcome news
 
to SanDisk's customers: it allows us to better meet the anticipated increase in global demand for flash memory in the coming years by supplementing our existing supply from FlashVision as well as from our other supply agreements with substantial new supplies of NAND flash from Samsung. I am particularly pleased and honored to sign these agreements with president Y.W. Lee of Samsung."
 
SanDisk will hold an investor conference call at 8:00 a.m. (Pacific time) today to discuss the matters covered by this press release. If you wish to listen to the call, dial 888-208-1812 at approximately 7:50 a.m. A webcast of the conference call will be available on and on for institutional investors.

 SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) today announced a settlement with Taiwan-based Power Quotient International Co., Ltd. and Power Quotient International-USA, Inc. (collectively, "PQI") in which PQI stipulated that their flash memory cards infringe SanDisk's U.S. Patent No. 5,602,987 ("the 987 Patent"), and that SanDisk's patent is valid and enforceable.
SUNNYVALE, CA, Oct. 21, 2002
 
As part of the settlement agreement, PQI also consented to an injunction and will not manufacture or sell their CompactFlash
or PC-ATA cards in the United States. PQI will pay SanDisk an undisclosed amount to compensate SanDisk for past sales.
 
Additionally, as part of the settlement, PQI agreed to provide notice to their customers that "PQI CompactFlash
and PC-ATA cards are subject to United States Patent No. 5,602,987. The unlicensed sale or importation of these cards into the United States constitutes infringement of United States Patent No. 5,602,987."
 
The agreement settles a complaint for patent infringement against PQI that SanDisk filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, which sought damages and an injunction against PQI from making, selling, offering for sale, using or importing into the U.S. all PQI CompactFlash
cards and PC cards that infringe SanDisk's U.S. Patent No. 5,602,987.
 
Steven S. Baik, senior intellectual property counsel for SanDisk, said, "This case confirms once again the validity and enforceability of the SanDisk 987 patent in the area of flash memory cards. This legal victory sends a clear message that SanDisk will aggressively enforce its intellectual property rights."

ITEM 5.    OTHER EVENTS
 
On October 16, 2002, we issued a press release announcing our financial results for the third quarter of 2002. A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
 
 
 
ITEM 7.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.
 
(c)    Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date:    November 6, 2002
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
October 16, 2002 . . . SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash memory data storage products, today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2002. Total third quarter revenues were $141.1 million, compared to $127.7 million in the second quarter of 2002. Product revenues were $132.0 million, up 14% from the prior quarter. Third quarter revenues from licenses and royalties were $9.1 million, down from $12.0 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter net income was $11.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share compared to the second quarter of $9.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. The third quarter effective tax rate was 39%, compared to 17% in the second quarter of 2002 and includes foreign withholding taxes on license payments received.
SUNNYVALE, CA,
 
Product gross margin for the third quarter was 34% compared to 27% in the second quarter of 2002. Average selling price per megabyte was relatively unchanged from the second quarter. Third quarter total units sold increased 2% and megabytes sold increased 12% compared to the previous quarter.
 
Total third quarter revenues increased 114% from $65.9 million in the third quarter of 2001. Product revenues increased 130% from $57.3 million in the same period of the prior year. Revenues from licenses and royalties increased $0.5 million from $8.6 million in the third quarter of 2001. The third quarter 2002 net income of $11.3 million compares to a net loss of $170.5 million, or negative $2.50 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2001.
 
"We are pleased with the solid performance and our financial results in the third quarter," said Dr. Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk. "Retail revenues grew sequentially by 19% reflecting increased sales in all geographic regions. Major contributions came from strong sales of Secure Digital (SD) cards and Cruzer, both relatively new products commanding higher gross margins. Sales to OEM customers
increased slightly over the prior quarter. New bookings during the traditionally slow summer quarter were 11% lower than bookings in the second quarter.
 
"Product gross margin improved to 34%, attributable to stable pricing conditions, lower product costs due primarily to a higher mix of the more cost effective MLC (Multi Level Cell) flash and the sale of $3.0 million of NOR flash inventory that was previously written off, which represented 2% of product gross margin contribution. Expense control remained good in all areas.
 
"During the quarter, we concluded important licensing and supply agreements with Samsung which resolved the costly litigation between us and established the framework for a productive relationship with Samsung in future years. In parallel, our FlashVision joint venture with Toshiba is on schedule to ramp up NAND flash production to meet the anticipated growth in demand for our products in future quarters. Early in October, we also announced with Toshiba our .09 micron (90 nanometer) next generation NAND flash joint development program. The 90 nanometer NAND flash is planned to deliver a lower cost, higher capacity successor in 2004 to the .13 micron NAND technology which is starting production at FlashVision in the current fourth quarter.
 
"Turning to the near term outlook, in recent years the fourth quarter has been our strongest quarter, driven primarily by retail sales in the traditionally strong year-end holiday sales season. We expect the same trend in the current fourth quarter. Similar to our experience last year in the same period, we anticipate that the majority of fourth quarter retail bookings and sales will occur in the second half of the quarter. Projected revenues for the fourth quarter will be driven primarily by consumer confidence, which frankly is difficult to gauge given the current political and economic market uncertainties. Income from licenses and royalties is expected to be approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter. Product gross margins are expected to be approximately 30% due to the anticipated increased availability of flash memory leading to declining average selling prices in the fourth quarter, partially offset by continuing cost reductions. Longer term, we believe that the flash markets that we address will continue to grow steadily in 2003, and we are determined to maintain the market leadership position that we have established over the past several years."
 
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements including our expectations for future product revenues and bookings, earnings and profitability, product demand, average selling prices, and gross margins that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: future average selling price erosion due to excess industry capacity and extreme price competition; increased expenses and fluctuations in operating results and yields related to the startup of flash memory wafer production for FlashVision at the Yokkaichi facility in Japan; potential delays in starting up production of NAND flash memory wafers at the FlashVision joint
venture at Yokkaichi which may reduce our available supply of flash memory and cause us to not be able to meet customer demand for our flash products; our increased exposure to interruption of supply due to our increased dependence on a principal source at Yokkaichi for our supply of NAND flash memory; the current global economic conditions in general and in our markets in particular; the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products based on the 1 Gigabit NAND MLC .16 and .13 micron flash chips that SanDisk is obligated to purchase from FlashVision; fluctuations in royalty revenues due to industry wide changes in demand for flash memory products which impact royalty bearing sales of our licensees; the timely introduction and acceptance of new consumer products that incorporate our flash storage devices; slower than expected growth in the emerging markets for our products which may result in reduced sales and increased inventory; successful management of assembly operations in China and Taiwan; the unknown economic impact of terrorist attacks and the military response thereto, or a war with Iraq; seasonality of product sales; market acceptance of our Secure Digital, Cruzer, Memory Stick and Ultra CompactFlash card products; our ability to prevail in patent litigation proceedings; and the other risks detailed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Forms 10Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and March 31, 2002 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2001. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We assume no obligation to update the information contained in this release.

SUNNYVALE, CA, January 22, 2003 . . . SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash memory data storage products, today announced results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2002. Total fourth quarter revenues were a record $179.8 million, up 27% sequentially from the prior quarter. Product revenues were $158.7 million, up 20% sequentially. Retail sales increased 35% and represented 69% of product sales, while OEM/Industrial sales declined 4% relative to the prior quarter due to continuing weakness in the Industrial/Telecom sector. Fourth quarter revenues from licenses and royalties were $21.1 million, up 133% sequentially due primarily to increased royalty-bearing sales by licensees. Product gross margin was a record 37%, up from 34% in the prior quarter. The average price per megabyte sold declined 15% sequentially. Fourth quarter units sold increased 21% and megabytes sold increased 43% compared to the previous quarter, both representing new record levels. Fourth quarter net income was $19.6 million, up 73% sequentially. Earnings per share were $0.26 per diluted share, up 63% sequentially and are net of unrealized losses of $15.8 million, before tax, or $0.20 per share, due to revaluation of the Company's equity investments in Tower Semiconductor and Divio.
 
Total revenue for fiscal 2002 was $541.3 million, up 48% from $366.3 million in 2001. Product revenues were $492.9 million, up 56% from $316.9 million in 2001. Revenues from licenses and royalties were $48.4 million, down 2% from $49.4 million in 2001. Net income was $36.2 million, compared to a net loss of $297.9 million in 2001. The net loss in 2001 included other-than-temporary impairment charges of $302.3 million, or $188.1 million net of tax. Earnings per share for fiscal 2002 were $0.51 per diluted share, which compared to a net loss of $4.37 per diluted share in 2001.
 
Product revenues for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased 90% and the average selling price per megabyte declined 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in units sold of 112% and in megabytes sold of 203% over the comparable period in 2001. Operating income totaled $42.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, compared to an operating loss of $14.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2001.
 
Net cash from operations was $40.9 million and $105.7 million for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2002, respectively. The Company's cash and short-term investment position increased $96.8 million or 33% from the prior year.
 
In the fourth quarter, retail revenues showed particularly strong growth in the US and Pacific Rim regions, with strong contributions from Compact Flash (CF), Secure Digital (SD) and Smart Media cards. SD card sales increased 82% from the prior quarter. Digital cameras were one of the hottest consumer electronics sellers this holiday season and SanDisk was a direct beneficiary because of its broad line of card products and its global distribution channels.
 
The product gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter was attributable to cost efficiencies from higher sales levels, increased sales of MLC (Multi Level Cell) flash, as well as the sale of $3.6 million of NOR flash inventory that was previously written off, which represented 2% of product gross margin contribution.
 
"We are exceptionally pleased with the fourth quarter results," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "The outlook for 2003 is encouraging despite an anticipated seasonal decline in the first quarter sales compared to the traditionally strong fourth quarter. We believe the markets that we address are relatively young and according to market forecasts are projected to grow at a fast pace in the next few years, thus spurring sales growth for our products. We plan to launch in 2003 a number of new and exciting products, some of which were announced at the January Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. In addition to the growing markets for our cards used in digital cameras and other digital consumer products, we continue to see strong design win activities, which we believe will give us increased penetration into new markets in 2003, such as advanced cell phones and embedded flash components. We believe that our ongoing transition from .16 micron to .13 micron NAND flash and MLC technology will allow us to continue our focus on aggressive cost reductions to give us a competitive cost structure. Despite the potential for near term pricing pressures, we are optimistic about the prospects for positive growth in our business in 2003."
 
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements including our expectations for future design wins, new product introductions, future product revenues and bookings, earnings and profitability, product demand, average selling prices, and gross margins that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: future average selling price erosion due to excess industry capacity and extreme price competition; increased expenses and fluctuations in operating results and yields related to the startup of .13 micron flash memory wafer production for FlashVision at the Yokkaichi facility in Japan; our increased exposure to interruption of supply due to our increased dependence on a principal source at Yokkaichi for our supply
of NAND flash memory; the current global economic conditions in general and in our markets in particular; the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products based on the NAND MLC .13 micron flash chips that SanDisk is obligated to purchase from FlashVision; fluctuations in royalty revenues due to industry wide changes in demand for flash memory products which impact royalty bearing sales of our licensees; the timely introduction and acceptance of new consumer products that incorporate our flash storage devices; slower than expected growth in the emerging markets for our products which may result in reduced sales and increased inventory; successful management of assembly operations in China and Taiwan; the unknown economic impact of terrorist attacks and the military response thereto, or a war with Iraq or in the Korean peninsula; seasonality of product sales; market acceptance of our Secure Digital, Cruzer, Memory Stick and Ultra CompactFlash card products; our ability to prevail in patent litigation proceedings; further impairment of our investments in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. and Divio, Inc. due to further decline in the stock valuation of either of these companies and the other risks detailed from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Form 10Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2002, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2001. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We assume no obligation to update the information contained in this release.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACT: Michael Gray, Senior Vice President Finance and Administration Chief Financial Officer (408) 542-0585 SANDISK ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2003 EARNINGS Record units and megabytes sold, increased OEM sales SUNNYVALE, CA, April 16, 2003 . . . SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash memory data storage card products, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Total first quarter revenues were $174.5 million, up 88% compared to the first quarter of 2002. Product revenues were $155.4 million, up 80% from $86.5 million in the same period of the prior year. First quarter total units sold increased 96%, total megabytes sold increased 205% and the average price per megabyte sold declined 40% compared to the same period of the prior year. Revenues from licenses and royalties were $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2003, up from $6.2 million in the same period of the prior year due primarily to increased royalty-bearing sales by licensees. First quarter net income was $24.9 million, net of unrealized losses of $6.7 million, before tax, resulting from revaluation of our equity investments in Divio and Tower Semiconductor. This compares to a net loss of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2002. Earnings per share for the first quarter of 2003 were $0.33 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $0.05 per diluted share in the same period in 2002. Product revenues for the first quarter of 2003 decreased 2% sequentially from the prior quarter. Growth in OEM sales of 30% partially offset a seasonal decline in retail sales of 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. First quarter total units sold increased 10% and total megabytes sold increased 29% compared to the previous quarter, both representing new record levels. First quarter product gross margins were 34%, down from 37% in the prior quarter. Average price per megabyte sold declined by 24% in the first quarter and was offset by comparable product cost reductions achieved during the quarter. First quarter sales of NOR flash inventory that was previously written off contributed 0.7% to product gross margins compared to 2% in the prior quarter. Revenues from licenses and royalties declined 10% from the prior quarter due to lower royalty-bearing sales by our licensees. Income before taxes of $27.6 million in the first quarter compares with $27.5 million in the prior quarter. In the first quarter of 2003, our provision for income taxes declined by $5.1 million due to a lower effective tax rate. This caused our net income to increase to $24.9 million in the first quarter from $19.6 million in the prior quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $34.0 million for the first quarter of 2003 compared to $3.6 million used in operating activities in the same quarter of 2002. Our cash and short-term investment position increased $28.0 million from the prior quarter to $484.5 million. "The first quarter was another excellent quarter for SanDisk. Results were better than expected considering the normal seasonal decline in first quarter retail sales compared to our
traditionally strong fourth quarter. We experienced a significant increase in sales to our OEM customers, which reached the highest sales level in the past eight quarters," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "During the quarter we introduced a number of important new products, including the miniSD card, which we believe will become a significant revenue generator for us in new cell phones with built-in digital cameras that are expected to be introduced this year. During the first quarter, we were able to move the retail market average card capacity to 120 megabytes, up from 90 megabytes in the prior quarter, through strategic pricing of higher capacity cards, where we enjoy the low cost benefits of our MLC (Multi Level Cell) NAND flash. Consumers are proving the significant price elasticity inherent to our business. We are currently on schedule to shift the majority of our NAND flash wafer starts at Yokkaichi from .16 micron to .13 micron in the second quarter. This transition should provide us with a lower cost structure for wafers manufactured by our FlashVision joint venture in Yokkaichi, starting in the third quarter of this year and continuing into 2004. With the projected growth in the usage of flash cards in digital cameras, cell phones and USB flash drives, we are optimistic about the prospects for our business in 2003." Second quarter 2003 business outlook: Retail sales are expected to be back-end loaded in the second quarter, while OEM sales are projected to continue the positive trend started in the first quarter. We currently anticipate second quarter 2003 total revenues to be approximately the same as the first quarter of 2003. Product gross margins are projected to be in the range of 26% to 30% due to the incremental costs that we expect to incur in the second quarter associated with the .13 micron NAND flash technology transition at FlashVision. Second quarter 2003 operating expenses are expected to increase moderately compared to the first quarter and our second quarter effective tax rate is expected to be consistent with the first quarter. This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including our expectations for new product introductions, future product revenues, average selling prices and gross margins, that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: future average selling price erosion due to excess industry capacity, start-up costs, fluctuations in operating results and yields related to the start-up of .13 micron flash memory wafer production for FlashVision at the Yokkaichi facility in Japan, adjustments to standard costs to reflect technology transitions, any interruption of supply from the Yokkaichi facility, current global economic and geo-political conditions, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products such as the new miniSD and the WiFi wireless cards that we announced in the first quarter, as well as new products that are based on the NAND and NAND/MLC .13 micron flash chips, fluctuations in royalty revenues, business disruption including reduced sales to our customers in the Pacific Rim that may arise from the current SARS epidemic in Asia, further impairment of our investments in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. and UMC due to the further decline in stock valuations and the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002. Future results may differ materially from those
previously reported. We assume no obligation to update the information contained in this release.

Exhibit 99.3 SANDISK FILES ACTION FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT OF NONINFRINGEMENT AND INVALIDITY AGAINST INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES AG SUNNYVALE, CA, JUNE 25, 2003 - SanDisk Corporation (NSDAQ: SNDK) announced today that it has filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Infineon Technologies AG. The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that SanDisk does not infringe United States Patent No. 5,726,601 (the "`601 patent") and that the `601 patent is invalid. SanDisk believes that its products do not infringe the `601 patent, as alleged in a letter received from Infineon. The Company believes Infineon's correspondence was motivated by Infineon's announced intention to become a flash supplier. Infineon is not a SanDisk patent licensee.

Exhibit 99.2
     SUNNYVALE, CA, July 16, 2003  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash memory data storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003. Total second quarter revenues grew 84% to $234.6 million compared to the second quarter of 2002 and increased 34% from the prior quarter of 2003. Second quarter net income was $41.3 million compared to $9.0 million and $24.9 million for the prior year's corresponding quarter and the first quarter of 2003, respectively. Earnings per share grew 300% for the second quarter of 2003 and were $0.52 per diluted share compared with $0.13 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2002. Earnings per share grew 58% sequentially compared to $0.33 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2003.
     "The second quarter was our best quarter ever for revenues and operating earnings. Megabytes and units sold in the quarter reflect record performance, far exceeding our internal forecasts. Demand for our products was exceptionally strong throughout the quarter from OEM and retail customers in all geographies. Current market demand is driven by strong sales of digital cameras as well as accelerating sales of camera cell phones, USB flashdrives and numerous other new applications for NAND flash. I am particularly pleased with our increasing penetration into the camera cell phone market, as well as our excellent internal execution in launching the miniSD card in the second quarter," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "Current demand for NAND flash is exceeding the total industry supply, resulting in a relatively benign pricing environment as we enter the third quarter. I am optimistic about our business prospects in the second half of the year."
Q2 Financial Highlights
 
Exhibit 99.2
Q2 Business Highlights
Business Outlook
     Despite continued limited bookings visibility, we are optimistic about our business prospects in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we are projecting continued strength in demand for our products in a relatively benign pricing environment fostered by industry-wide NAND flash memory capacity shortages. We are operating at 100% capacity utilization of our captive sources and maximizing our purchases from non-captive sources. Third quarter product revenues are expected to be capped at a level slightly higher than in the strong second quarter due to these capacity constraints. License and royalty revenues are expected to be approximately $18 million and operating expenses are projected to increase by approximately 12% sequentially. We project that third quarter product gross margins will be in the range of 28-32% which includes increased contribution from non-captive sources that typically generate lower product gross margins. The effective tax rate is forecast to increase to approximately 15% for the second half of the year. Share count changes will largely be a function of the average quarterly stock price. We expect our NAND flash supply availability from captive and non-captive sources to improve considerably in the fourth quarter, in time for the expected seasonally strong year-end.
Forward-Looking Statement
     This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including our business outlook, expectations for new product introductions, capacity, future product revenues, average selling prices, gross margins, operating margins and tax rates, that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: fluctuations in operating results, yields and possible delays related to the start-up of .13 micron flash memory wafer production for FlashVision at the Yokkaichi facility in Japan, delays in qualification of some new .13
 
Exhibit 99.2
micron product components, any interruption of supply from the Yokkaichi facility, future average selling price erosion due to excess industry capacity, current global economic and geo-political conditions, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products such as the new miniSD, as well as new products that are based on the NAND and NAND/MLC .13 micron flash chips, fluctuations in royalty revenues, business disruption including reduced sales to our customers in the Pacific Rim that may arise from regional issues in Asia, further impairment of our investments in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. and UMC due to any further decline in stock valuations and the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, the Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed on July 16, 2003, the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
 
On September 15, 2003, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release announcing the offering of 7,800,000 shares of its common stock. Registrant has granted the underwriters of the offering an option to purchase an additional 1,170,000 shares to cover over-allotments. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
 
On September 15, 2003, the Registrant also issued a press release announcing its updated business outlook for the third quarter and second half of 2003. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
 
In addition, on September 15, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Registrant determined it was in the best interests of the Registrant and its stockholders to amend the Registrant's existing stockholders' rights plan to terminate the preferred share purchase rights issued under the rights plan effective September 25, 2003 or such other date that new preferred share purchase rights are issued under Registrant's new rights plan described below. Also on September 15, 2003, the Registrant adopted a new rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right, or Right, for each outstanding share of the Registrant's common stock, $0.001 par value. The dividend is payable on September 25, 2003, the record date, to stockholders of record on that date. The terms of the new rights plan are substantially the same as those contained in the Registrant's existing rights plan. The new rights plan does, however, make three modifications to the terms of the existing rights plan. First, the new rights plan provides that a Three-Year Independent Director Evaluation Committee, or TIDE Committee, of the Board of Directors of the Registrant will review and evaluate, at least once every three years, the new rights agreement in order to consider whether the maintenance of the new rights agreement continues to be in the interests of the Registrant and its stockholders. The TIDE Committee will be comprised of members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors who are "independent" as defined by applicable law and the listing standards of the Nasdaq National Market in effect from time to time. Second, the new rights plan removes an exception to the definition of "Acquiring Person", as described below, so that all of Registrant's investors will be subject to the same ownership limitations. Third, the new rights plan reduces the purchase price per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, described below, from $500 to $450 and decreases the redemption price from $.01 to $.001 per Right.
 
The following description sets forth the material terms of the new rights plan.
 
Under the new rights plan, each Right will entitle the registered holder to purchase from the Registrant one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value, referred to as the Preferred Shares, at a purchase price of $450.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement by and between the Registrant and Computershare Trust Company, Inc. as Rights Agent.
 
Until the earlier to occur of (i) ten (10) days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons, referred to as an Acquiring Person, have acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares or (ii) ten (10) business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of such outstanding Common Shares, the earlier of such dates being called the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the common stock share certificates outstanding as of the record date, by such common stock share certificate.
 
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the Distribution Date or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights, new Common Share certificates issued after the record date, upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares, will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights, the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the record date will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights will be mailed to holders of record of shares of common stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
 
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire at the close of business on April 28, 2007, referred to as the Final Expiration Date, unless the rights Agreement is amended to change the Final Expiration Date or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Registrant.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Shares with a conversion price, less than the then current market price of the Preferred Shares, or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends paid out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in Preferred Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
The number of outstanding Rights and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of each Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the shares of common stock or a stock dividend on the shares of common stock payable in shares of common shares or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the shares of common stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
 
Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend declared per share of common stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per share of common stock. Each Preferred Share will have 100 votes, voting together with the shares of common stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of common stock are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per share of common stock. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.
 
Because of the nature of the Preferred Shares' dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-hundredth interest in a Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of common stock.
 
In the event that, following the Distribution Date, the Registrant is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction with an Acquiring Person or an affiliate thereof, or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold to an Acquiring Person or an affiliate thereof, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
 
In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (except pursuant to a tender offer for all of the shares of common stock at a price and on terms determined by a majority of the Board of Directors to be fair to and otherwise in the best interests of the Registrant and its stockholders), proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of shares of common stock (or cash, other securities or property) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
 
At any time after the acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, the Board of Directors of the Registrant may exchange the Rights (other than the Rights owned by such person or group which have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock (or a fraction of a Preferred Share having equivalent market value) per Right (subject to adjustment).
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional Preferred Shares will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, which may, at the election of the Registrant, be evidenced by depositary receipts) and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
 
At any time prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the Distribution Date (unless the Board of Directors extends such ten (10) day period), the Board of Directors of the Registrant may redeem the Rights in whole, but not
in part, at a redemption price of $.001 per Right, upon the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors. The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the redemption price. The Rights are also redeemable under other circumstances as specified in the Rights Agreement.
 
The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Registrant without the consent of the holders of the Rights, upon the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors, including an amendment to lower certain thresholds described above to not less than the greater of (i) any percentage greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known to the Registrant to be beneficially owned by any person or group of affiliated or associated persons and (ii) 10%, except that from and after the Distribution Date no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Registrant, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the Registrant on terms not approved by the Registrant's Board of Directors, except pursuant to an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors since the Rights may be redeemed by the Registrant at the redemption price prior to the occurrence of a Distribution Date or the new rights plan may be amended to provide that the Final Expiration Date will occur prior to such Distribution Date.
 
The form of the Rights Agreement, dated as of September 15, 2003, by and between the Registrant and the Rights Agent, specifying the terms of the Rights, is attached hereto as an exhibit and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Rights is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit. The foregoing description of the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibit.

EXHIBIT 4.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Rights Agreement (this "Agreement" or the "Rights Agreement") is entered into as of September 15, 2003 by and between SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Computershare Trust Company, Inc. (the "Rights Agent").
 
 
the Board of Directors of the Company on September 15, 2003 (i) authorized, approved and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each Common Share (as hereinafter defined) of the Company outstanding as of the Close of Business (as hereinafter defined) on September 25, 2003 (the "Record Date"), each Right representing the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (as hereinafter defined) upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and (ii) further authorized and directed the issuance of one Right with respect to each Common Share that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter defined).
WHEREAS,
 
Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
 
Section 1. . For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings indicated:
Certain Definitions
 
(a) "Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which, together with all Affiliates and Associates (as such terms are hereinafter defined) of such Person, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as such term is hereinafter defined) of 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding, but shall not include the Company, any Subsidiary (as such term is hereinafter defined) of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing:
 
(i) no Person shall become an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of Common Shares by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares beneficially owned by such Person to 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding; provided, however, that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding by reason of share purchases by the Company and shall, after such share purchases by the Company, become the Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Shares of the Company, then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person";

Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report); or
 
(iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other Person with which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of securities) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (except to the extent contemplated by the proviso to Section 1(d)(ii)(B)) or disposing of any securities of the Company.

Issue of Right Certificates
 
(a) Until the earlier of (i) the tenth day after the Shares Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of the Company or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any Person becoming the Beneficial Owner of Common Shares aggregating 15% or more of the then outstanding Common Shares (including any such date which is after the date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the Rights; the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the "Distribution Date"), (x) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof) by the certificates for Common Shares registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be Right Certificates) and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the right to receive Right Certificates will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Shares. As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company will notify the Rights Agent thereof and the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Company will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class, insured, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Right Certificate, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (a "Right Certificate"), evidencing one Right for each Common Share so held. As of the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.
 
(b) On the Record Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Company will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Purchase Preferred Shares, in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage-prepaid mail, to each record holder of Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Record Date, at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company. With respect to certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by
 
such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof together with a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto. Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Shares outstanding on the Record Date, with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights attached thereto, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby.
 
(c) Certificates for Common Shares which become outstanding (including, without limitation, reacquired Common Shares referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph (c)) after the Record Date but prior to the earliest of the Distribution Date, the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:
 
This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between SanDisk Corporation and Computershare Trust Company, Inc., dated as of September 15, 2003 (the "Rights Agreement"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of SanDisk Corporation. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. SanDisk Corporation will mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request therefor. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, Rights issued to any Person who becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) may become null and void.
 
With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or acquires any Common Shares after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Shares shall be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the Common Shares which are no longer outstanding.
 
Section 4. . The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase Preferred Shares and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially the same as Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any stock exchange or transaction reporting system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Section 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number
Form of Right Certificates
 
of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share as shall be set forth therein at the price per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share set forth therein (the "Purchase Price"), but the number of such one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share and the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.
 
Section 5. . The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its President, any of its Vice Presidents, or its Treasurer or Chief Financial Officer, either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof, and shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights Agreement any such person was not such an officer.
Countersignature and Registration
 
Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its office designated for such purpose, books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates.
 
Section 6. . Subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof, at any time after the Close of Business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to the Close of Business on the earlier of the Redemption Date or the Final Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share (or other securities or property) as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver to the person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
Transfer, Split-Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates
 
Upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.
 
Section 7. .
Exercise of Rights; Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights
 
(a) Except as provided in Section 23(c), the registered holder of any Right Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby (except as otherwise provided herein) in whole or in part at any time after the Distribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to purchase and certification on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, together with payment of the Purchase Price for each one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share as to which the Rights are exercised, at or prior to the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on April 28, 2007 (the "Final Expiration Date"), (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "Redemption Date"), (iii) the time at which such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof, or (iv) the consummation of any merger or other acquisition involving the Company pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1(d)(ii)(A)(2) hereof.
 
(b) The Purchase Price for each one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share pursuant to the exercise of a Right shall initially be $450.00, shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof and shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) below.
 
(c) Upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the Purchase Price for the shares to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 9 hereof by certified check, cashier's check or money order payable to the order of the Company, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) requisition from any transfer agent of the Preferred Shares certificates for the number of Preferred Shares to be purchased and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply with all such requests, or (B) requisition from a depositary agent properly appointed by the Company depositary receipts representing such number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share as are to be purchased (in which case certificates for the Preferred Shares represented by such receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with the depositary agent) and the Company hereby directs the depositary agent to comply with such request, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) after receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate.
 
(d) In case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.
 
(e) The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued Preferred Shares or any Preferred Shares held in its treasury, the number of Preferred Shares that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights in accordance with this Section 7.
 
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder upon the occurrence of any purported exercise as set forth in this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such exercise, and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.
 
Section 8. . All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all cancelled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company.
Cancellation and Destruction of Right Certificates
 
Section 9. .
Availability of Preferred Shares
 
(a) The Company covenants and agrees that it will use its best efforts to cause to be reserved and kept available out of and to the extent of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock not reserved for another purpose (and, following the occurrence of an event described in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a), out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock and/or other securities), the number of Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of any such event, Common Stock and/or other securities) that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.
 
(b) If the Preferred Shares (or, following the occurrence of an event described in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a), the Common Shares and/or other securities) are at any time listed on a national securities exchange or included for quotation on any transaction reporting system, then so long as the Preferred Shares (and, following the occurrence of any such event, Common Shares and/or other securities) issuable and deliverable upon exercise of the Rights may be listed on such exchange or included for quotation on any such transaction reporting
 
system, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable (but only to the extent that it is reasonably likely that the Rights will be exercised), all shares reserved for such issuance to be listed on such exchange or included for quotation on any such transaction reporting system upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise.
 
(c) The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the earliest date after the first occurrence of an event described in Section 11(a)(ii) in which the consideration to be delivered by the Company upon exercise of the Rights has been determined in accordance with Section 11(a)(iv) hereof, or as soon as is required by law following the Distribution Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and (iii) cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities or (B) the date of expiration of the Rights. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days after the date set forth in clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section 9(c), the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file such registration statement and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating, and notify the Rights Agent, that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement and notification to the Rights Agent at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. The Company will also take such action as may be appropriate under, or to ensure compliance with, the securities or "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with the exercisability of the Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction, unless the requisite qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained, or an exemption therefrom shall be available and until a registration statement has been declared effective.
 
(d) The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all Preferred Shares delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such Preferred Shares (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.
 
(e) The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any Preferred Shares upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depositary receipts for the Preferred Shares in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or to deliver any certificates or depositary receipts for Preferred Shares upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax is due.
 
Section 10. . Each person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the Preferred Shares represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes) was made; provided, however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Preferred Shares transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the Preferred Shares transfer books of the Company are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred Shares for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein.
Preferred Shares Record Date
 
Section 11. . The Purchase Price, the number of Preferred Shares covered by each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11.
Adjustment of Purchase Price, Number of Shares or Number of Rights
 
(a) (i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares, (B) subdivide the outstanding Preferred Shares, (C) combine the outstanding Preferred Shares into a smaller number of Preferred Shares or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred Shares (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred Shares transfer books of the Company were open, such holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. If an event occurs which would require an adjustment under both Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii), the adjustment provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addition to, and shall be made prior to any adjustment required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii).
 
(ii) Subject to Section 24 of this Agreement, in the event that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of Common Shares of the Company as shall equal the result
 
obtained by dividing (x) the product obtained by multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable, by (y) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Company's Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of the occurrence of such event. Except as provided in Section 23(c), in the event that any Person shall become an Acquiring Person and the Rights shall then be outstanding, the Company shall not take any action which would eliminate or diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the first occurrence of an event in which any Person shall become an Acquiring Person, any Rights beneficially owned by (A) an Acquiring Person or an Associate or Affiliate of an Acquiring Person, (B) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring Person becomes such, or (C) a transferee of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person becoming such and receives such Rights pursuant to either (1) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of equity interests in such Acquiring Person or to any Person with whom the Acquiring Person has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or (2) a transfer which the Board of Directors, has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a primary purpose or effect the avoidance of this Section 11(a)(ii), shall become null and void without any further action and no holder of such Rights shall have any rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights, whether under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise. No Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 that represents Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof; no Right Certificate shall be issued at any time upon the transfer of any Rights to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence or any Associate or Affiliate thereof or to any nominee of such Acquiring Person, Associate or Affiliate; and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent for transfer to an Acquiring Person whose Rights would be void pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be cancelled. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder.
 
(iii) The right to buy Common Shares of the Company pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph (a) shall not arise if the event causing such Person to become an Acquiring Person (A) is a consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or similar transaction subject to Section 13 hereof, or (B) is an acquisition of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or an exchange offer for all outstanding Common Shares at a price and on terms determined by at least a majority of the Board of Directors, and after receiving advice from one or more investment banking firms, to be (1) at a price which is fair to stockholders (taking into account all factors which such members of the Board of Directors deem relevant including, without limitation, prices which could reasonably be achieved if the Company or its assets were sold in an orderly basis designed to realize maximum value) and (2) otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
 
(iv) In lieu of issuing Common Shares in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the Company may, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines that such action is necessary or appropriate and not contrary to the interest of holders of Rights (and, in the event that the number of Common Shares which are authorized by the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation but not outstanding or reserved for issuance for purposes other than upon exercise of the Rights are not sufficient to permit the exercise in full of the Rights, or if any necessary regulatory approval for such issuance has not been obtained by the Company, the Company shall): (A) determine the excess of (1) the value of the Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of a Right (the "Current Value") over (2) the Purchase Price (such excess being referred to as the "Spread") and (B) with respect to each Right, make adequate provision to substitute for such Common Shares, upon exercise of the Rights, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in the Purchase Price, (3) other equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares or units of shares of any series of preferred stock which the Board of Directors of the Company has deemed to have the same value as Common Shares (such shares or units of shares of preferred stock are herein called "common stock equivalents")), except to the extent that the Company has not obtained any necessary regulatory approval for such issuance, (4) debt securities of the Company, except to the extent that the Company has not obtained any necessary regulatory approval for such issuance, (5) other assets or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having an aggregate value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, based upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors of the Company; provided, however, if the Company shall not have made adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the occurrence of an event described in Section 11(a)(ii), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase Price, Common Shares (to the extent available), except to the extent that the Company has not obtained any necessary regulatory approval for such issuance, and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If the Board of Directors, shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional Common Shares could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights or that any necessary regulatory approval for such issuance will be obtained, the thirty (30) day period set forth above may be extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of an event described in Section 11(a)(ii), in order that the Company may seek stockholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares or take action to obtain such regulatory approval (such period, as it may be extended, the "Substitution Period"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of this Section 11(a)(iv), the Company (x) shall provide that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights held by holders entitled to receive Common Shares or other securities or property upon exercise of such Rights and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of additional shares, to take any action to obtain any required regulatory approval and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall
 
issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect and shall promptly notify the Rights Agent of such suspension. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iv), the value of the Common Shares shall be the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the Common Shares at the Close of Business on the date of the occurrence of one of the events described in Section 11(a)(ii) and the value of any "common stock equivalent" shall be deemed to have the same value as the Common Shares on such date.
 
(b) In the event that the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Shares entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares (or shares having the same rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Shares ("equivalent preferred shares")) or securities convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares at a price per Preferred Share or equivalent preferred share (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into Preferred Shares or equivalent preferred shares) less than the then current per share market price of the Preferred Shares (as defined in Section 11(d)) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of Preferred Shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current market price and the denominator of which shall be the number of Preferred Shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional Preferred Shares and/or equivalent preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible). In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights. Preferred Shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Preferred Shares (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Preferred Shares) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then current per share market price of the Preferred Shares on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be
 
distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one Preferred Share and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Preferred Shares. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
 
(d) (i) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of any security (a "Security" for the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior to such date; provided, however, that in the event that the current per share market price of the Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security and prior to the expiration of thirty (30) Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on Nasdaq or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on Nasdaq, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use, or, if on any such date the Security is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no market maker is making a market in the Security, the "current per share market price" of such Security on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company as provided for above shall be used. The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.
 
(ii) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Shares shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the Preferred Shares are not publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Shares shall be conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price of the Common Shares as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof), multiplied by one hundred. If neither the Common Shares nor the Preferred Shares are publicly held or so listed or traded, "current
 
per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
 
(e) No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one one-millionth of a Preferred Share or one ten-thousandth of any other share or security as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the date of the expiration of the right to exercise any Rights.
 
(f) If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than Preferred Shares, thereafter the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Shares contained in Section 11(a) through (c), inclusive, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect to the Preferred Shares shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
 
(g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
 
(h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share (calculated to the nearest one one-millionth of a Preferred Share) obtained by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of one one-hundredths of a share covered by a Right immediately prior to this adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price by, (ii) the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price.
 
(i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the
 
record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
 
(j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
 
(k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below one one-hundredth of the then par value, if any, of the Preferred Shares issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Preferred Shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
 
(l) In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date of the Preferred Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Preferred Shares and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.
 
(m) Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Shares, issuance wholly for cash of any Preferred Shares at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Shares or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Shares, dividends on Preferred Shares payable in Preferred Shares or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Shares shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
 
(n) In the event that, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in Common Shares) into a greater or lesser number of Common Shares, then in any such case (A) the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share purchasable after such event upon proper exercise of each Right shall be determined by multiplying the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share so purchasable immediately prior to such event by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately before such event and the denominator of which is the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such event, and (B) each Common Share outstanding immediately after such event shall have issued with respect to it that number of Rights which each Common Share outstanding immediately prior to such event had issued with respect to it. The adjustments provided for in this Section 11(n) shall be made successively whenever such a dividend is declared or paid or such a subdivision, combination or consolidation is effected.
 
Section 12. . Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Shares or the Preferred Shares a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the failure by the Company to make such certification or give such notice shall not affect the validity of or the force or effect of the requirement for such adjustment. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment contained therein and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of such adjustment unless and until it shall have received such certificate.
Certificate of Adjusted Purchase Price or Number of Shares
 
Section 13. .
Consolidation, Merger or Sale or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power
 
(a) Except as provided in Section 13(b) hereof, in the event, directly or indirectly, (1) the Company shall consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other Person, (2) any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger and, in connection with such consolidation or merger, all or part of the Common Shares shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person (or the Company) or cash or any other property, or (3) the Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, directly or indirectly, assets or earning power aggregating 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person other than the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that (i) each holder of a Right (except as otherwise provided herein) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to the then current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Shares, such number of Common Shares of such other Person (including the Company as successor thereto or as the surviving corporation) as shall equal the result obtained by dividing (A) the
 
product obtained by multiplying the then current Purchase Price by the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share for which a Right is then exercisable, by (B) 50% of the then current per share market price of the Common Shares of such other Person (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; (ii) the issuer of such Common Shares shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such issuer; and (iv) such issuer shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its Common Shares in accordance with Section 9 hereof) in connection with such consummation as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the Common Shares thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights. The Company shall not consummate any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless prior thereto the Company and such issuer shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement so providing. The Company shall not enter into any transaction of the kind referred to in this Section 13 if at the time of such transaction there are any rights, warrants, instruments or securities outstanding or any agreements or arrangements which, as a result of the consummation of such transaction, would eliminate or substantially diminish the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply to successive mergers or consolidations or sales or other transfers.
 
The supplemental agreement referred to above in this Section 13(a) to be entered into by the Company and the Rights Agent shall also provide that, as soon as practicable after the date of any of the events described in this Section 13(a), such issuer shall:
 
(i) prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the Final Expiration Date, and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws;
 
(ii) use its best efforts to list (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on a national securities exchange or to meet the eligibility requirements for quotation on Nasdaq; and
 
(iii) deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for such issuer which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the Exchange Act.
 
(b) In the event of any merger or other acquisition transaction involving the Company pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1(d)(ii)(A)(2), the provisions of Section 13(a) hereof shall not be applicable to such transaction and this Agreement and the rights of holders of Rights hereunder shall be terminated in accordance with Section 7(a) hereof.
 
(c) The term "issuer," for purposes of this Section 13, shall refer to the Person (or Affiliate or Associate) referred to in Section 13(a); provided, however, that (i) if such Person (or Affiliate or Associate) is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person, the term "issuer" shall refer to such other Person, and (ii) in case such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the term "issuer" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of such Common Shares having the greatest aggregate value.
 
(d) If, for any reason, the Rights cannot be exercised for Common Shares of such issuer as provided in Section 13(a), then each holder of Rights shall have the right to exchange its Rights for cash from such issuer in an amount equal to the number of Common Shares that it would otherwise be entitled to purchase multiplied by 50% of the current per share market price, as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof, of such Common Shares of such issuer. If, for any reason, the foregoing provision cannot be applied to determine the cash amount into which the Rights are exchangeable, then the Board of Directors of the Company, based upon the advice of one or more nationally recognized investment banking firms, shall determine such amount reasonably and with good faith to the holders of Rights. Any such determination shall be final and binding on the Rights Agent and the holders of Rights.
 
Section 14. .
Fractional Rights and Fractional Shares
 
(a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on Nasdaq or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on Nasdaq, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, shall be used.
 
(b) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Preferred Shares (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share). Fractions of Preferred Shares in integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share
 
may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it; provided, however, that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Shares represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional Preferred Shares that are not integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one Preferred Share. For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a Preferred Share shall be the closing price of a Preferred Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise.
 
(c) The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise of a Right (except as provided above).
 
Section 15. . All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Shares); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Shares), may, in such holder's own behalf and for such holder's own benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such holder's right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations hereunder, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.
Rights of Action
 
Section 16. . Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that:
Agreement of Right Holders
 
(a) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Shares;
 
(b) after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the office of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; and
 
(c) subject to Sections 6 and 7(f) hereof, the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated Common Shares certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right
 
Certificates or the associated Common Shares certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
 
(d) notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory or administrative agency or commission, or any statute, rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or enacted by any governmental authority, prohibiting or otherwise restraining performance of such obligation; provided, however, the Company must use its best efforts to have any such order, decree or ruling lifted or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.
 
Section 17. . No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Preferred Shares or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in Section 25 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Right Certificate Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder
 
Section 18. . The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense, incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for any action taken, suffered or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the execution, acceptance and administration of this Agreement and the exercise and performance hereunder of its duties, including the costs and expenses of defending against and appealing any claim of liability in the premises. The indemnity provided herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the expiration of the Rights. The costs and expenses incurred in enforcing this right of indemnification shall be paid by the Company.
Concerning the Rights Agent
 
The Rights Agent may conclusively rely upon and shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with, its administration of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder in reliance upon any Right Certificate or certificate for the Preferred Shares or Common Shares or for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified
 
or acknowledged, by the proper person or persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth in Section 20 hereof.
 
Section 19. . Any corporation into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the stock transfer or corporate trust business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent
 
In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
 
Section 20. . The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms and conditions and no implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Duties of Rights Agent
 
(a) Before the Rights Agent acts or refrains from acting, it may consult with legal counsel of its choice (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the advice or opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion.
 
(b) Whenever in the administration, exercise and performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and
 
such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
 
(c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
 
(d) The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
 
(e) The Rights Agent shall not be under any liability or responsibility in respect of the legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the legality, validity or enforceability or the execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof and has actual knowledge of such change or adjustment); nor shall it be liable or responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Section 3, 11, 13, 23 or 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of the certificate described in Section 12 hereof or has actual knowledge of such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any Preferred Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any Preferred Shares will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
 
(f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
 
(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the administration, exercise and performance of its duties hereunder from any one of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be responsible or liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five (5) Business Days after the
 
date any officer of the Company actually received such application, unless any such officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
 
(h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
 
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
 
(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if the Rights Agent in good faith believes that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
 
(k) If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange, the certification on the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, that the Rights evidenced by the Right Certificate are not owned by an Acquiring Person, or an Affiliate or Associate thereof, has either not been completed or in any manner indicates any other response thereto, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange, without first consulting with the Company.
 
Section 21. . The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares (as to which the Rights Agent has received prior written notice) by registered or certified mail, and the Company shall mail notice thereof to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares (as to which the Rights Agent has received prior written notice) by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a
Change of Rights Agent
 
Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any state of the United States, in good standing, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers, and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
 
Section 22. . Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors, to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Common Shares following the Distribution Date and prior to the redemption or expiration of the Rights, the Company (a) shall, with respect to Common Shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of stock options or under any employee benefit plan or arrangement or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities of the Company currently outstanding or issued at any time in the future by the Company and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Company, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; provided, however, that (i) no such Right Certificate shall be issued and this sentence shall be null and void ab initio if, and to the extent that, such issuance or this sentence would create a significant risk of or result in material adverse tax consequences to the Company or the Person to whom such Right Certificate would be issued or would create a significant risk of or result in such options' or employee plans' or arrangements' failing to qualify for otherwise available special tax treatment and (ii) no such Right Certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the issuance thereof.
Issuance of New Right Certificates
 
Section 23. .
Redemption
 
(a) The Company may, at its option, upon approval by a majority of the Board of Directors, at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the tenth business day following the Shares Acquisition Date, or (ii) such date or dates on or after the tenth business day following the Shares Acquisition Date to which such option may be extended by a majority of the Board of Directors
 
(for one or more successive 10 day periods) by vote(s) first taken or written consent(s) first given prior to the tenth business day following the Shares Acquisition Date and, thereafter, prior to the completion of any such 10 day extension or extensions (or, if the Shares Acquisition Date shall have occurred prior to the Record Date, prior to (A) the tenth business day following the Record Date or (B) such date or dates on or after the tenth business day after the Record Date to which such option may be extended by a majority of the Board of Directors (for one or more successive 10 day periods) by vote(s) first taken or written consent(s) first given prior to the tenth business day following the Record Date and, thereafter, prior to the completion of any such 10 day extension or extensions), redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $.001 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption Price"), and the Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price either in cash, Common Shares (based on the current per share market price thereof (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) at the time of redemption), or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. The redemption of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.
 
(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 23, and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within 10 days after such action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights Agent and shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Shares. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption will state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value any Rights at any time in any manner other than that specifically set forth in this Section 23 or in Section 24 hereof, and other than in connection with the purchase of Common Shares prior to the Distribution Date.
 
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable pursuant to Section 7(a) at any time when the Rights are redeemable hereunder.
 
Section 24. .
Exchange
 
The Company, at its option, upon approval by a majority of the Board of Directors, at any time after any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, may exchange all or part of the then outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend
 
or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (such exchange ratio being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any such Subsidiary, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan), together with all Affiliates and Associates of such Person, becomes the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the Common Shares then outstanding.
 
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of Common Shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; provided, however, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company promptly shall mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of such Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the Common Shares for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
 
In any exchange pursuant to this Section 24, the Company, at its option, may substitute Preferred Shares (or equivalent preferred shares, as such term is defined in Section 11(b) hereof) for Common Shares exchangeable for Rights, at the initial rate of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (or equivalent preferred share) for each Common Share, as appropriately adjusted to reflect adjustments in the voting rights of the Preferred Shares pursuant to the terms thereof, so that the fraction of a Preferred Share delivered in lieu of each Common Share shall have the same voting rights as one Common Share.
 
In the event that there shall not be sufficient Common Shares or Preferred Shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with Section 24(a), the Company shall either take such action as may be necessary to authorize additional Common Shares or Preferred Shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights or alternatively, at the option of the Board of Directors, with respect to each Right (i) pay cash in an amount equal to the Purchase Price, in lieu of issuing Common Shares or Preferred Shares in exchange therefor, or (ii) issue debt or equity securities, or a combination thereof, having a value equal to the Current Value (as hereinafter defined) of the Common Shares or Preferred Shares exchangeable for each such Right, where the value of such securities shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Board of Directors, or (iii) deliver any combination of cash, property, Common Shares, Preferred Shares and/or other securities having a value equal to the Current Value in exchange for each Right. The term "Current Value", for the purposes of this Section 24, shall mean the product of the current per share market price of Common Shares (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the occurrence of the event described above in subparagraph (a)) multiplied by the
 
number of Common Shares for which the Right otherwise would be exchangeable if there were sufficient shares available. To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 24(d), the Board of Directors, may temporarily suspend the exercisability of the Rights for a period of up to sixty (60) days following the date on which the event described in Section 24(a) shall have occurred, in order to seek any authorization of additional Common Shares or Preferred Shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to the above provision and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended.
 
The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Common Shares or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. In lieu of such fractional Common Shares, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Common Shares would otherwise be issuable an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Common Share. For the purposes of this paragraph (e), the current market value of a whole Common Share shall be the closing price of a Common Share (as determined pursuant to the second sentence of Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of exchange pursuant to this Section 24.
 
Section 25. .
Notice of Certain Events
 
(a) In case the Company shall propose (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Preferred Shares or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Preferred Shares (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its Preferred Shares rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional Preferred Shares or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Shares (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision of outstanding Preferred Shares), (iv) to effect any consolidation or merger into or with, or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or other transfer), in one or more transactions, of 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to, any other Person, (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or (vi) to declare or pay any dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or to effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Shares (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of dividends in Common Shares), then, in each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which shall specify the record date for the purposes of such stock dividend, or distribution of rights or warrants, or the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place and the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares and/or Preferred Shares, if any such date is to be fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least ten (10) days prior to the record date for determining holders of the Preferred Shares for purposes of such action, and in the case of any such other action, at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action or the date of participation therein by the holders of the Common Shares and/or Preferred Shares, whichever shall be the earlier.
 
(b) In case any of the events set forth in Section 11(a)(ii) hereof shall occur, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe such event and the consequences of such event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) hereof. In the event any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Company will promptly notify the Rights Agent thereof.

From and after the Distribution Date, the Company may from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Rights, by action of its Board of Directors, in order to cure any ambiguity, to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other provisions herein, or to make any other provisions with respect to the Rights which the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which shall be consistent with, and for the purpose of fulfilling, the objectives of the Board of Directors in adopting this Agreement, including, without limitation, to change the Purchase Price, the Redemption Price, any time periods herein specified, and any other term hereof, any such supplement or amendment to be evidenced by a writing signed by the Company and the Rights Agent; provided, however, that from and after such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, this Agreement shall not

Upon receipt of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Company that the proposed supplement or amendment is consistent with this Section 27 and, after such time as any Person has become an Acquiring Person, that the proposed supplement or amendment does not adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights, the Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or amendment. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company may at any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, by action of its Board of Directors, amend this Agreement to lower the thresholds set forth in Sections 1(a) and 3(a) to not less than the greater of (i) any percentage greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known by the Company to be beneficially owned by any Person (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or any entity holding Common Shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan) and (ii) 10%.

The Board of Directors of the Company shall have the exclusive power and authority to administer this Agreement and to exercise all rights and powers specifically granted to the Board, or the Company, or as may be necessary or advisable in the administration of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the right and power to (i) interpret the provisions of this Agreement and (ii) make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of this Agreement (including a determination to redeem or not redeem the Rights or to amend the Agreement). All such actions, calculations, interpretations and determinations (including, for purposes of clause (y) below, all omissions with respect to the foregoing), which are done or made by the Board in good faith, shall (x) be final, conclusive and binding on the Company, the Rights Agent, the holders of the Right Certificates and all other parties and (y) not subject the Board to any liability to the holders of the Rights.
Determinations and Actions by the Board of Directors
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that the Three-Year Independent Director Evaluation Committee (the "TIDE Committee") (as described below) of the Board of Directors of the Company shall review and evaluate this Agreement in order to consider whether the maintenance of this Agreement continues to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, at least once every three years, or sooner than that if (i) any Person shall have made a proposal to the Company or its stockholders, or taken any other action that, if effective, could cause such Person to become an Acquiring Person, and (ii) a majority of the members of the TIDE Committee shall deem such review and evaluation appropriate after giving due regard to all relevant circumstances. Following each such review, the TIDE Committee will communicate its conclusions to the full Board of Directors of the Company, including any recommendation in light thereof as to whether this Agreement should be modified or the Rights should be redeemed. The TIDE Committee shall be comprised of members of the
 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors who are "independent" as defined under applicable law and Nasdaq listing standards (or the listing standards of the principal exchange or trading system on which the Company's shares of common stock are listed or admitted for trading) in effect from time to time, and who are selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, and may be the full Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.
 
The TIDE Committee shall have the power to set its own agenda and to retain, at the expense of the Company, independent legal, accounting or other professional consultants selected by the TIDE Committee, for any matters relating to the purpose of the TIDE Committee. The Company shall cause its employees to make themselves available to cooperate with the TIDE Committee for any matters related to its purpose.

Benefits of this Agreement
 
Section 31. . If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any such term, provision, covenant or restriction is held by such court or authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable and the Board of Directors of the Company, determines in its good faith judgment that severing the invalid language from this Agreement would adversely affect the purpose or effect of this Agreement, the right of redemption set forth in Section 23 hereof shall be reinstated and shall not expire until the tenth business day following the date of such determination by the Board of Directors of the Company.

(A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of the Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock).
 
(C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A
 
Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
 
Section 3. . The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
Voting Rights
 
(A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
(B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.
 
(C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.
 
Section 4. .
Certain Restrictions
 
(A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:
 
(i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;
 
(ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
 
(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
 
(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
 
(B) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
 
Section 5. . Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.
Reacquired Shares
 
Section 6. . Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in
Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up
 
clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
 
Section 7. . In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
Consolidation, Merger, etc
 
Section 8. . The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.
No Redemption
 
Section 9. . The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock.
Rank
 
Section 10. . The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall not be amended in any manner which would materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class.

Exhibit C
 
 
 
On September 15, 2003, the Board of Directors of SanDisk Corporation (the "Company") declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock (the "Common Stock"), par value $.001 per share (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend is payable on September 25, 2003 (the "Record Date") to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $450.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of September 15, 2003 (the "Rights Agreement") between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, Inc. as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").
 
Until the earlier to occur of (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "Acquiring Person") have acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares or (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of such outstanding Common Shares (the earlier of such dates being called the "Distribution Date"), the Rights will be evidenced, with respect to any of the Common Share certificates outstanding as of the Record Date, by such Common Share certificate with a copy of this Summary of Rights attached thereto.
 
The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date, upon transfer or new issuance of Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for Common Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of this Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
 
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire at the close of business on April 28, 2007 (the "Final Expiration Date"), unless the Final Expiration Date is changed or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Company.
 
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Shares, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Shares of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Shares with a conversion price, less than the then current market price of the Preferred Shares or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends paid out of earnings or retained earnings or dividends payable in Preferred Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above).
 
The number of outstanding Rights and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of each Right are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Shares or a stock dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Shares occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
 
Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend declared per Common Share. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per Common Share. Each Preferred Share will have 100 votes, voting together with the Common Shares. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Shares are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per Common Share. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.
 
Because of the nature of the Preferred Shares' dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-hundredth interest in a Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one Common Share.
 
In the event that, after the Rights become exercisable, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction with an Acquiring Person or an affiliate thereof, or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold to an Acquiring Person or an affiliate thereof, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
 
In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (except pursuant to a tender offer for all of the Common Shares at a price and on terms determined by a majority of the Board of Directors to be fair to and otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders) proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that number of Common Shares (or cash, other securities or property) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
 
At any time after the acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one Common Share (or a fraction of a Preferred Share having equivalent market value) per Right (subject to adjustment).
 
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional Preferred Shares will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Shares on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise.
 
At any time prior to the tenth (10th) business day after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (unless the Board of Directors extends such ten-day period), the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.001 per Right (the "Redemption Price"), upon the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors. The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price. The Rights are also redeemable under other circumstances as specified in the Rights Agreement.
 
The terms of the Rights may be amended by the Board of Directors of the Company without the consent of the holders of the Rights, including an amendment to lower certain thresholds described above to not less than the greater of (i) any percentage greater than the largest percentage of the outstanding Common Shares then known to the Company to be beneficially owned by any person or group of affiliated or associated persons and (ii) 10%, except that from and after a Distribution Date no such amendment may adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Rights.
 
In addition, the Rights Agreement provides that a Three-Year Independent Director Evaluation Committee (the "TIDE Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Registrant will review and evaluate the Rights Agreement in order to consider whether the maintenance of the Rights Agreement continues to be in the interests of the Registrant and its stockholders at least once every three years. The TIDE Committee will be comprised of members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors who are "independent" as defined by applicable law and the listing standards of the Nasdaq National Market (or the listing standards of the principal exchange or trading system on which the Company's shares of common stock are listed or admitted for trading) in effect from time to time.
 
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
 
A copy of the Rights Agreement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a Registration Statement on Form 8-A. A copy of the Rights Agreement is available free of charge from the Company. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA, September 15, 2003, SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) today announced that it will offer 7,800,000 shares of its common stock in a public offering. SanDisk has granted the underwriters for the offering an option to purchase an additional 1,170,000 shares to cover over allotments.
 
SanDisk currently anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock in the offering to invest in new flash memory fabrication and test capacity and for general corporate purposes, including working capital and other capital expenditures. SanDisk may also use the proceeds to fund acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses or to obtain the right to use additional technologies.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA, September 15, 2003, SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) today updated its business outlook for the quarter ending September 30, 2003 and fiscal year 2003. This announcement was made in connection with SanDisk's separate announcement today of its intention to make a public offering of its shares under its previously filed shelf registration statement.
 
Business Outlook
 
SanDisk disclosed today its expectation of continued strength in demand for its products. Thus far in the September 30, 2003 quarter, SanDisk is experiencing record bookings and a relatively benign pricing environment fostered by apparent industry-wide NAND flash memory capacity shortages. As previously stated, third quarter product revenues are expected to be capped at a level slightly higher than in the second quarter due to NAND flash memory supply constraints. SanDisk is maximizing capacity utilization of its captive sources and purchases from non-captive sources. Product gross margins are expected to be between 28% and 32%. Operating expenses are projected to increase by approximately 12% sequentially.

8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated expressly for use therein.
provided
however
 
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying
 
party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
pro rata
 
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company (including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company) and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
 
9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Shares which it has agreed to purchase hereunder at a Time of Delivery, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Shares on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Shares on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Shares, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Shares.

Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
     On October 13, 2003, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release announcing that the United States District Court for the Northern District of California had ruled in the SanDisk patent case against Ritek Corporation and granted Ritek's motion for summary judgment. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
     On Oct. 10, 2003, in the case involving SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Ritek Corporation, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted defendant Ritek Corporation's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement. In its order, the court found that the accused Ritek CompactFlash memory cards did not infringe on SanDisk's patent, United States Patent No. 5,602,987 ("Flash EEPROM system"). The order does not affect the validity of the patent.
SUNNYVALE, CA, OCT. 13, 2003 
     Charles Van Orden, SanDisk vice president and general counsel, said, "SanDisk respectfully but strongly disagrees with the court's ruling and will immediately take steps to appeal the decision to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. SanDisk believes that the court incorrectly interpreted the claims of the patent and that the company has a strong basis for appeal."
     License obligations under SanDisk's existing licenses are not impacted by the court ruling and, accordingly, the company does not expect royalty income to be affected.

Exhibit 99.1
     Late in the afternoon on October 14, 2003, SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) was advised by its Taiwanese law firm, Lee and Li, one of the largest law firms in Asia, that one of Lee and Li's senior associates had fraudulently sold, and misappropriated the proceeds from, approximately 121 million shares of SanDisk's United Microelectronics Corporation stock held by Lee and Li on behalf of SanDisk pursuant to a power of attorney. The current market value of the misappropriated shares is approximately $100 million. In a press release issued late yesterday in Taiwan by Lee and Li and in a separate written assurance, the firm stated that it will not let SanDisk suffer any loss as a result of its former employee's criminal acts. Both SanDisk and Lee and Li are vigorously investigating the incident. SanDisk is also investigating whether it is insured against any portion of this loss.

Exhibit 99.2
     SUNNYVALE, CA, October 15, 2003  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2003. Total third quarter revenues grew 99% to $281.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2002 and increased 20% sequentially. Third quarter net income was $50.6 million compared to $11.3 million and $41.3 million for the third quarter of 2002 and the second quarter of 2003, respectively. Earnings per share grew 275% for the third quarter of 2003 and were $0.60 per diluted share compared with $0.16 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2002. Earnings per diluted share grew 15% sequentially and reflect a tax rate of 35% compared to $0.52 per diluted share with a tax rate of 9% in the second quarter of 2003.
     "The third quarter was an outstanding operational quarter for SanDisk," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "Bookings during the quarter were exceptionally strong for both our OEM and retail customers. We exceeded our expectations for third quarter product revenues and total megabytes shipped due to excellent execution in operations and the successful conversion to .13 micron technology. Product gross margins improved to 35% from 32% in the prior quarter due to the benign pricing environment, as well as higher margin contribution from the increasing sales of Secure Digital cards. For the first time we sold more than 10 million total cards during the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to increase our flash shipments from new capacity coming on stream primarily from our FlashVision joint venture. We are also projecting seasonally strong demand for our products and a continuing benign pricing environment."
Q3 Financial Highlights
 
Q3 Business Highlights
Business Outlook
     We are optimistic about our business prospects in the fourth quarter of the year. We continue to expand our capacity and are maximizing our flash memory supply from both captive and non-captive sources. Following the trend of the previous two years, we expect that our fourth quarter will be seasonally strong in retail, and that our primary challenge will be to meet consumer demand for our products. Our 2003 total revenue is forecasted to exceed $1.0 billion, up from our September projection of $950 million. License and royalty revenues are projected to be approximately $24 million. Product gross margin is expected to be in the range of 32-36%, reflecting a continuing benign pricing environment, lower product costs from our captive .13 micron flash memory and higher flash memory costs from our non-captive sources. Operating expenses are forecasted to increase by approximately 13-15%. The effective tax rate is projected to be 20-22%. An increase in interest income is anticipated due to the proceeds from our underwritten public offering and our share count will increase by approximately 8.3 million shares. Additional share count changes will largely be a function of the average quarterly stock price.
Separate Announcement
     SanDisk separately announced today that it was advised late yesterday by its Taiwanese law firm, Lee and Li, one of the largest law firms in Asia, that one of Lee and Li's attorneys had fraudulently sold, and misappropriated the proceeds from shares of SanDisk's United Microelectronics Corporation stock held by Lee and Li on behalf of SanDisk pursuant to a power of attorney. The third quarter financial results included in this press release do not account for this theft. The amount of loss, if any, is not determinable at this time. Any amount that is not fully repaid may result in non-operating accounting charges in the periods corresponding to the dates of the fraudulent sales.

SANDISK ANNOUNCES RECORD FOURTH QUARTER REVENUES AND OPERATING EARNINGS ANNUAL REVENUES INCREASE 99% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO EXCEED $1 BILLION; ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 298% YEAR-OVER-YEAR SUNNYVALE, CA, January 21, 2004 -- SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2003. Total fourth quarter revenues grew 116% to $389 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2002 and increased 38% sequentially. Income from license and royalties grew to $36 million, up 63% from $22 million in the prior quarter. Fourth quarter net income was $88 million compared to $20 million and $15 million for the fourth quarter of 2002 and the third quarter of 2003, respectively. Earnings per share grew 262% for the fourth quarter of 2003 and were $0.94 per diluted share compared with $0.26 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2002. Total revenue for fiscal 2003 was $1.1 billion, up 99% from $541 million in 2002. Product revenues were $982 million, up 99% from $493 million in 2002. Net income was $169 million, compared to net income of $36 million in 2002. Earnings per share for fiscal 2003 were $2.03 per diluted share, which compared to net earnings of $0.51 per diluted share in 2002. "Our excellent performance in the fourth quarter capped an outstanding year for SanDisk," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "In the fourth quarter we were able to meet the strong surge in holiday season demand and increased our megabyte shipments by 39%, primarily from increased production of .13 micron NAND at our FlashVision joint venture. In the past two quarters alone, we shipped almost as many megabytes of flash memory as in the prior fifteen years combined. Royalty income increased dramatically in the fourth quarter, reflecting the industry-wide growth of flash memory shipments by our licensees. This is a testimony to the value of SanDisk's broad based patents in these growing markets." "I am grateful to our worldwide employees for their fantastic team execution, our global customers for making this our first billion dollar year, and our partners and suppliers. In particular, we are privileged to have Toshiba as our steadfast FlashVision joint venture partner. We are also appreciative of the excellent support we are receiving from Samsung in consistently meeting their supply commitments in the face of tight capacity."
"We are optimistic about our business prospects, based on projected continuing strong growth in our target markets for digital cameras and portable digital consumer electronics, the growing adoption of our cards in camera cell phones, and our growing market share in USB flash drives. Flash storage technology and product innovations are enabling numerous other emerging industrial, telecom, automotive and medical applications. Market research reports are forecasting flash cards to grow from $3.5 billion in 2003 to more than $10 billion by 2007. SanDisk is the market leader for flash cards worldwide and we believe we are exceptionally well positioned to be a major participant as this very large opportunity unfolds. We expect to face competition from new flash memory chip suppliers starting late in 2004 or in 2005. This will challenge us to relentlessly drive down our costs through our technology transitions and economies of scale, create new and exciting storage products, and expand our global sales reach and brand awareness among consumers." Q4 FINANCIAL/BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS - Product revenues were a record $353 million, a growth rate of 36% sequentially and 123% year-over-year. - Income from license and royalties increased to $36 million, up 63% from $22 million in the third quarter and up 70% from the corresponding quarter last year. - Sales of CompactFlash and SD cards each exceeded $100 million in the fourth quarter. SanDisk also experienced strong sales growth of Cruzer Mini, miniSD, xD Picture Card and TriFlash products. - Total megabytes sold in the fourth quarter were a record and increased 39% sequentially and 250% year-over-year. Total megabytes sold in 2003 were approximately 235% higher than in 2002. - Average price per megabyte sold in the fourth quarter declined 1.7% sequentially and 36% compared to the corresponding quarter of last year. Average price per megabyte sold in 2003 declined by 40% compared to 2002. - Total gross margin was 42.3% of total revenues and product gross margin was 36.4%, up from 35.3% in the third quarter of 2003. - Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $109 million in the fourth quarter and SanDisk completed an underwritten public offering in the fourth quarter adding $522 million in net proceeds. SanDisk's cash and short-term investment position was $1.3 billion at year-end. - SanDisk signed an agreement with Fujifilm enabling the Company to manufacture xD-Picture Cards for Fuji and to sell cards under the Fuji label through SanDisk's global retail distribution channels. - SanDisk was added to the prestigious NASDAQ -100(R) Index. - Toshiba and SanDisk announced that they intend to accelerate construction of a new 300-millimeter Fab 3 wafer fabrication facility at Toshiba's Yokkaichi operations in order to meet projected growing demand for NAND flash memory in the second half of the decade.
SEPARATE ANNOUNCEMENT SanDisk separately announced today that its Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend to each stockholder of record at the close of business on February 3, 2004. BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2004 SanDisk is optimistic about business prospects in 2004 and expects: - Total annual revenues between $1.5 billion and $1.75 billion - License and royalty revenue of approximately $30 million per quarter with potential upside in the first and fourth quarters - Average change in selling price per megabyte comparable to the overall decline in 2003 rates at approximately 40%. Price declines are expected to be more moderate in the first half and in the second half of the year price declines are expected to reflect new capacity increases - Product gross margins in the first half of approximately 32-36%, and 28-32% in the second half - Operating expenses are expected to increase as the business grows and average approximately 15% of total revenues - Effective tax rate of approximately 37% - Capital equipment outlays of approximately $75 million primarily for SanDisk test equipment and $175 million in equipment loans to FlashVision. In the first quarter of 2004 SanDisk projects: - Modest seasonal decline in product revenues of 5%-10% sequentially. License and royalty revenues comparable with the fourth quarter of 2003 - Product gross margins of between 33% and 35% - Operating expense sequential growth of approximately 12%-14% due to volume increases, additional research and development hiring, and increases in marketing expenses. These projections could vary significantly depending on a number of factors primarily related to growth in demand and the growth in supply, both of which are difficult to forecast accurately for any particular quarter in 2004. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including our business outlook, expectations for new product introductions, capacity, future product revenues, average selling prices, gross margins, operating margins and tax rates, that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     SUNNYVALE, CA, April 14, 2004  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 28, 2004. First quarter total revenues increased 122% to $387 million compared to the first quarter of 2003 and were essentially unchanged from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. First quarter product sales were up 118% year-over-year and down 4% to $339 million compared to $353 million in the fourth quarter. Income from license and royalties increased to $48 million, up 153% and 34% year-over-year and sequentially. First quarter operating income was $99 million, compared to $35 million and $109 million for the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2003, respectively. The first quarter effective tax rate was 37% compared to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2003. Earnings per share were $0.34 per diluted share compared with $0.17 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2003 and $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.
     "The first quarter was another good quarter for SanDisk given the traditional first quarter seasonality. Royalty income significantly exceeded our expectations due to strong sales of flash memory by our licensees in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we introduced a number of important products that are expected to materially contribute to our revenues in 2004 and in future years. Specifically, these include Shoot and Store consumable flash cards targeted for sales through supermarkets and convenience stores, TransFlash for semi-embedded storage in new models of camera cell phones, Reduced-Size MultiMediaCard for removable storage primarily in European multimedia camera phones, a broad lineup of new Cruzer USB flashdrives, and the industry's broadest lineup of MemoryStick Pro and Pro Duo," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation.
     "Supply and demand were in balance throughout the first quarter which resulted in stable pricing. Early in the second quarter we announced the world's first 4 gigabit NAND MLC monolithic chip, which employs the new 90-nanometer technology that we developed jointly with Toshiba. This chip is expected to start production in the third quarter of 2004 and we expect this will allow us to build highly cost effective 512 megabyte (MB) capacity cards using just one NAND chip and one controller chip. We recently initiated price reductions averaging approximately 20% for many of our products, primarily focusing on 256MB and higher capacities. The new lower pricing is intended to proactively drive demand elasticity and accelerate the retail consumer market transition towards 512MB and higher capacity cards in the second half of 2004. We expect overall year-over-year price reductions to be approximately at
 
the previously stated 40%, which we consider healthy for stimulating the rapid growth and continuing adoption of flash storage in new mega market applications."
Additional Q1 Financial/Business Highlights
Business Outlook for the Second Quarter and 2004
     SanDisk continues to be optimistic about business prospects in 2004 and expects:
     These projections could vary significantly depending on a number of factors primarily related to growth in market demand and supply, the success of our recent price actions, start-up costs and capital outlays, and incremental supply and yields from our new 90 nanometer NAND MLC technology, all of which are difficult to forecast accurately for any particular quarter in 2004.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
     This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including our business outlook, expectations for new product introductions, capacity, future revenues, average selling prices, gross margins, operating expenses, capital equipment expenditures and tax rates that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: market demand for our products may grow more slowly than our expectations or a slower adoption rate for these products in new markets that we are targeting, our recent price reductions may not result in strengthening demand as we anticipate, fluctuations in operating results, yields and possible delays related to our planned conversion to 90 nanometer NAND flash currently planned to start in the second half of the year, any interruption of or delay in supply from any of the semiconductor manufacturing facilities that supply products to us, future average selling price erosion that may be more severe than our expectations due to possible excess industry capacity of flash memory either from existing suppliers or from new competitors, decreased demand, price increases from non-captive flash memory sources and third-party subcontractors, higher than expected operating expenses due to unanticipated hiring and marketing expenses, higher than anticipated capital expenditures due to unexpected outlays for test equipment and FlashVision, adverse global economic and geo-political conditions, including adverse currency exchange rates, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products that are based on the 90 nanometer NAND technology, fluctuations in license and royalty revenues, higher than anticipated tax rates, business interruption due to earthquakes or other natural disasters, particularly in areas in the Pacific Rim where we manufacture and assemble products, further impairment of our investments in Tower Semiconductor Ltd. due to any decline in stock valuations, and the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, the Form 10-K for the year ended December 28, 2003 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We assume no obligation to update the information contained in this release.

Exhibit 99.1
,  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced the appointment of Judy Bruner as Executive Vice President of Administration and CFO. Ms. Bruner brings over 20 years of experience leading finance and administration functions and managing technology companies through periods of high growth. At SanDisk, she will be responsible for heading finance, investor relations, legal, human resources, business development and IT functions.
SUNNYVALE, CA
April 30, 2004
"SanDisk's expectations for rapid growth in the coming years dictate that we bring in someone of Judy's financial and management skills to help us build our infrastructure, manage our growth and capture our opportunity to its fullest. Judy has brought tremendous strength to our Board, in particular the Audit Committee, in the past few years. While we will miss her on the Board, we are truly fortunate to have her join our executive staff. I am really happy and excited with this significant strengthening of our senior management team," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation.
     Judy Bruner has been a SanDisk Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board since 2002. She plans to step-down immediately from the Audit Committee and will step down from her Director position after a brief transition period.
 
     From 1999 until current, Ms. Bruner has served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Palm Inc. where she helped guide the company through the spin-off from 3Com and the Palm IPO, and then as CFO of palmOne with the spin-off of PalmSource and the acquisition of Handspring. Ms. Bruner has a diverse financial background with experience at both a start-up and large corporations including 3Com and Hewlett Packard.
     Bruner will assume her new role on June 21, 2004 as Michael Gray transitions out of his current role as CFO at SanDisk.
     "I would like to thank Michael Gray for his excellent support, hard work, and high integrity during these last 9 years," stated Eli. "Michael was instrumental in taking SanDisk public, raising equity financing, increasing SanDisk's visibility in the investment community and growing the company from about $50M when he started to over $1B in 2003 revenues. Mike leaves many friends at SanDisk and we wish him well as he spends time with his family before pursuing other career opportunities."

Exhibit 99.2
     SanDisk announced today that in the case involving SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK), defendant Ritek Corporation and defendant Pretec Electronics Corporation, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted defendant Pretec's motion for summary judgment of non-infringement on the same ground that summary judgment was previously granted for defendant Ritek Corporation in October 2003. The District Court's grant of summary judgment merely extends the effect of the Court's October 2003 order to Pretec CompactFlash memory cards. The order does not affect the validity of the patent in question, SanDisk's United States Patent No. 5,602,987.
SUNNYVALE, CA, May 3, 2004 
     The District Court's grant of summary judgment for Pretec applied the same claim construction that the District Court used in its October 2003 order granting summary judgment for defendant Ritek, a claim construction that SanDisk is in the process of appealing. In its order, the District Court expressly denied Pretec's attempt to expand the Court's October 2003 order to find non-infringement on the basis of new claim construction arguments. The Court declared that Pretec was barred from raising such new arguments in the future.
     Charles Van Orden, SanDisk vice president and general counsel, said, "As I stated in October 2003, SanDisk respectfully but strongly disagrees with the court's claim construction ruling. SanDisk is pleased that this order will clear the way for SanDisk to now move forward with its appeal with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. SanDisk strongly believes that the court incorrectly interpreted the claims of the 987 patent and that the company has a strong basis for appeal."
     As SanDisk stated in October 2003, license obligations under SanDisk's existing licenses are not impacted by the court ruling and, accordingly, the company does not expect royalty income to be affected.

Exhibit 99.1
SUNNYVALE, CA, July 14, 2004  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 27, 2004. Second quarter total revenues increased 85% to $433 million compared to the second quarter of 2003 and increased 12% from the first quarter of 2004. Second quarter net income was $71 million, compared to $41 million and $64 million for the second quarter of 2003 and the first quarter of 2004, respectively. Earnings per share were $0.38 per diluted share compared with $0.26 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2003 and $0.34 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2004.
"Record results for our second quarter are a testimony to the success of SanDisk's strategy and unique business model, which combines vertical integration of leading edge technology, rapid introduction of differentiated products targeted at new applications, expanding worldwide retail distribution and a strong portfolio of patents to generate significant operating margins," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation.
"The pricing moves that we initiated early in the second quarter stimulated consumer demand and resulted in 38% sequential quarterly growth in total megabytes and 24% sequential growth in average capacity per card sold in retail. Product gross margins improved to 35%, despite a 16% decline in average selling price per megabyte, because of a favorable mix of MLC and captive flash, and the positive impact of our product segmentation strategy; fully 25% of the retail revenue in the second quarter came from highly differentiated products. Late in the quarter we shipped first production cards employing our new 4Gbit NAND/MLC chip, and as planned we are starting to ramp 90 nanometer production in the third quarter," added Harari.
"I am particularly encouraged by the growing acceptance of flash cards and modules in dozens of new generation cell phones sporting mega pixel cameras, music players, video clips, video games and internet access, which we expect will be one of the major catalysts for strong growth in demand for our products in the next several years," said Harari.

Table of Contents
Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On September 10, 2004, SanDisk Corporation, or SanDisk, closed a transaction with Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba, under which SanDisk and Toshiba created a new semiconductor company, Flash Partners, Ltd., a Japanese , owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba, and agreed to cooperate in the construction and equipping of a new 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, Fab 3, to produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. Toshiba is bearing the cost to construct the Fab 3 building, which will be located in Yokkaichi, Japan, the manufacturing site of the parties' current FlashVision joint venture. Both parties will equally share the cost of the manufacturing equipment as well as startup costs and initial design and development of manufacturing process technology, which costs are expected to be substantial, and depreciation of the Fab 3 building will be a component of the cost per wafer charged to each party. With the creation of Flash Partners, Ltd., SanDisk and Toshiba are expanding their current business relationship. In 2000, SanDisk and Toshiba formed a joint venture, FlashVision, to equip a 200-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, operate the facility and supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba.
yugen kaisha
     The total investment in Fab 3, excluding the cost of building construction, is currently estimated at $2.5 billion through the end of 2006, of which SanDisk's share is estimated to be approximately $1.25 billion, with initial NAND product production currently scheduled for the end of 2005. This investment is expected to generate approximately 37,500 wafers per month, of which SanDisk's allocation will be 50%. Fab 3 has available space to expand capacity beyond 37,500 wafers per month, and it is expected that further investments and output would continue to be shared 50/50 between SanDisk and Toshiba. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.
     In connection with the Fab 3 transaction, SanDisk, SanDisk International Limited, or SanDisk International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk, and Toshiba entered into a Flash Partners Master Agreement, or Master Agreement, and other ancillary agreements, each dated as of September 10, 2004, the material rights and obligations of which are described herein. The Master Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to equip and operate Fab 3. Under the terms of the Master Agreement, SanDisk is obligated to purchase half of Fab 3's NAND wafer production output. In addition to the Master Agreement, SanDisk International and Toshiba entered into a Flash Partners Operating Agreement, which sets forth the provisions governing the business of Flash Partners, the conduct of Flash Partners' affairs and the rights, powers, preferences, limitations and responsibilities of Flash Partners' unitholders, employees and directors.
     SanDisk and Toshiba also entered into an Amended and Restated Common R&D and Participation Agreement, or Common R&D Agreement, and an Amended and Restated Product Development Agreement, or Product Development Agreement, each of which governs both the FlashVision and Flash Partners relationships. The Common R&D Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which SanDisk participates in Toshiba's development of certain manufacturing process technology common to each party's products. SanDisk's payment obligation under the Common R&D Agreement is based on a variable computation with certain payment caps and is paid in installments. The Product Development Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to jointly develop certain products and technologies, and SanDisk's payment obligation thereunder is based on a variable computation.
     In addition to the agreements described above, SanDisk and Toshiba also entered into a Patent Indemnification Agreement and a Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement. The Patent Indemnification Agreement provides for certain rights and obligations of each party for claims that NAND flash memory products manufactured and sold by Flash Partners infringe third-party patents. Under the Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement, Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and Flash Partners for, environmental remediation costs or liability resulting from Flash Partners' manufacturing operations in certain circumstances.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Contact: Media Contact: Lori Barker Padon Mike Wong (408) 542-9565 (408) 548-0223 SANDISK ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS REVENUES INCREASE 45% YEAR OVER YEAR AND OPERATING MARGIN AT 21% SUNNYVALE, CA, October 13, 2004 -- SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 26, 2004. Third quarter total revenues increased 45% to $408 million compared to the third quarter of 2003 and decreased 6% from the second quarter of 2004. Third quarter net income was $54 million, compared to $15 million* and $71 million for the third quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2004, respectively. Earnings per share were $0.29 per diluted share compared with $0.09* per diluted share in the same quarter of 2003 and $0.38 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004. "Industry wide supply of NAND flash memory increased at a faster rate than the increase in demand during the summer months. Although we sold a record numbers of units and megabytes, we experienced a steeper than expected average price per megabyte decline of 22% compared to the second quarter. This resulted in third quarter revenues 6% below the second quarter and product margins approximately 6 points below the second quarter and 1 point below the low end of our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. Despite aggressive price declines, we were able to generate 21% operating margins and $129 million in cash from operations for the quarter," said Eli Harari, President and CEO of SanDisk Corporation. "During the third quarter we introduced an array of exciting new products that are starting to ship this holiday season, including the world's fastest flash cards - our new line of SanDisk Extreme IIITM cards, and a new line of flash digital music players that we introduced yesterday and which we expect to become a major new product category for us. We continue to make steady inroads into mobile phones, and are shipping flash card bundles to Motorola, Sony Ericsson, Samsung Mobile, NEC and Siemens, among others. In the third quarter we shipped more than 1 million TransFlashTM modules, and we currently expect seven leading handset OEM's to introduce more than 40 handset models using TransFlashTM in 2005, " Harari added. "We are optimistic about global demand for our products in the traditionally strong fourth quarter. We have a front row seat in what we believe are some of the fastest growing markets in consumer electronics, mobile handsets, USB Flashdrives and digital music players. In the fourth quarter we expect to break for the first time the 10 cents per megabyte price point at the consumer level for our 512 megabyte and gigabyte capacity cards. This is one tenth of the price of flash cards just three years ago and represents a major milestone for flash storage, which we believe will accelerate the wide-scale
adoption of our flash cards in numerous mobile and consumer applications. We expect to achieve this price point while maintaining our profitability through significant reductions in our captive production costs in the fourth quarter as we ramp up production of our newest, leading edge 90 nanometer NAND/MLC 4 gigabit Flash memory chips, which deliver significantly lower cost per megabyte than our current .13 micron production technology. With proper execution, we believe we are well positioned to exceed the $500 million quarterly revenue mark for the first time in the fourth quarter," said Harari. ADDITIONAL THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AND HIGHLIGHTS o Product sales were $365 million, a growth of 41% year-over-year and a decrease of 7% sequentially. o Average price per megabyte sold in the third quarter declined 34% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. o Income from license and royalties increased to $43 million from $42 million in the second quarter. o Total gross margin was 36% of revenues compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2003 and 41% in the second quarter of 2004. o Product gross margin was 29%, compared to 35% in both the third quarter of 2003 and in the second quarter of 2004. o Operating income was $84 million, a growth of 25% year-over-year and a decline of 24% sequentially. Operating margins were 21%, compared to 25% in the prior quarter. o Cash flow from operations was $129 million. o Total megabytes sold in the third quarter were a record and increased 115% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. o Average density per card sold in retail increased sequentially to 254MB from 236MB. o OEM sales grew to 22% of product revenues from 19% in the prior quarter with strength in the mobile handset market. o The TransFlashTM mobile module sold over one million units during the quarter. o SanDisk Ultra(R)II high performance cards took top awards in independent performance tests and the Ultra products were among our fastest growing products. o SanDisk global brand advertising campaign expanded to North American TV advertising during the 2004 Athens Olympics. o M-Systems and SanDisk signed a strategic collaboration and patent cross licensing agreement to jointly develop and promote a new USB Flash Drive platform. o Toshiba and SanDisk signed an agreement for the new 300mm NAND Fab at Toshiba's Yokkaichi facility currently scheduled to start production late in 2005.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On December 24, 2004, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement") with Mitsui Leasing & Development, Ltd. ("Mitsui"). Under this Guarantee Agreement, SanDisk will guarantee the payment obligations of Flash Partners yugen kaisha ("Flash Partners"), SanDisk's 49.9%-owned flash memory manufacturing company formed with Toshiba Corporation, to Mitsui under a Basic Lease Agreement for semiconductor manufacturing equipment to be installed in Fab 3 at Toshiba's Yokkaichi operations (the "Basic Lease Agreement") dated as of December 24, 2004 among Flash Partners (as Lessee) and Mitsui, IBJ Leasing Co., Ltd. ("IBJ") and Sumisho Lease Co., Ltd. ("Sumisho") (collectively, the "Lessors"). Toshiba has entered into a similar guarantee agreement with IBJ and Sumisho and SanDisk has no guarantee obligations to these other Lessors. SanDisk's guarantee obligation represents 50% of Flash Partners' 50 billion obligation to the Lessors under the Basic Lease Agreement.
Under the Basic Lease Agreement, Flash Partners will lease flash memory manufacturing equipment from the Lessors for a period of four or five years, upon the mutual agreement of Flash Partners and the Lessors. Under the Basic Lease Agreement, Flash Partners is obligated to make quarterly lease payments. The Basic Lease Agreement also provides Flash Partners with an option to purchase the leased equipment.
If Flash Partners defaults on any of its financial obligations under the Basic Lease Agreement guaranteed by SanDisk, Mitsui may demand that SanDisk perform such obligations within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of such demand, so long as Mitsui has first provided Flash Partners with 10 business days to cure such default.
Additionally, the Lessors may terminate the Basic Lease Agreement, and accelerate all of Flash Partners' obligations under the Basic Lease Agreement, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) Flash Partners' failure to make payments under the Basic Lease Agreement or related agreements and the applicable payments are not made within two business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (ii) Flash Partners' failure to obtain and maintain required insurance over the leased equipment; (iii) Flash Partners' failure to release encumbrances over the leased equipment; (iv) Flash Partners' breach of any provision of any related agreement, which breach of a related agreement is not cured within 10 business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (v) a petition for            compulsory execution or public sale is filed      , or any procedure to collect tax delinquency is taken, or any petition for bankruptcy or similar proceeding is filed, with respect to Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk unless such petition or procedure is cancelled or ceases to exist within 30 calendar days; (vi) Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk discontinues the whole or material part of its business, or adopts a resolution of dissolution without the approval of the Lessors; (vii) Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk receives a governmental order to suspend the whole or material part of its business or to prohibit continuation of such business; (viii) Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk assign all or a material part of their business without the consent of the Lessors; (ix) Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk suspend payment or any clearing bank undertakes procedures for suspension of transactions by Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk with banks and similar institutions; (x) there is a change in the interest
Table of Contents
ratio in Flash Partners directly or indirectly invested by each of Toshiba and SanDisk without the agreement of the Lessors; (xi) the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004 among Toshiba, SanDisk and SanDisk International Limited is cancelled, annulled or terminated; (xii) any monetary obligation of Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk in excess of $20.0 million has become immediately due and payable, other than obligations where the third-party creditor has explicitly or implicitly agreed to the delay or the amount is in dispute and the third-party creditor has agreed that it will not commence taking remedies for a reasonable period before settlement; or (xiii) any other material adverse change affecting payments under the Basic Lease Agreement (excluding changes which can be resolved within 30 calendar days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors).
Upon the occurrence of any of these events, the Lessors may, at their option, terminate the Basic Lease Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to Flash Partners, and Mitsui may demand that SanDisk perform its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of such demand.
Upon such default or termination as described above, SanDisk will be jointly and severally liable with Flash Partners to Mitsui, without any obligation on the part of Mitsui to first exhaust any remedies it may have against Flash Partners.

Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: Investor Contact: Media Contact: Lori Barker Padon Mike Wong (408) 542-9565 (408) 548-0223 SANDISK ANNOUNCES RECORD FOURTH QUARTER REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME o REVENUE OF $549 MILLION; EPS $0.42 o UNITS UP 45% AND MEGABYTES UP 110% SEQUENTIALLY FROM PRIOR QUARTER o PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN INCREASES 3 POINTS TO 32%; OPERATING MARGIN 23% o STRONG CONSUMER SALES INTO DIGITAL CAMERAS, FLASH DRIVES, MOBILE HANDSETS AND DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYERS SUNNYVALE, CA, January 27, 2005 - SanDisk(R) Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended January 2, 2005. Total fourth quarter revenues increased 41% on a year-over-year basis to $549 million and increased 35% compared to the third quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter net income, which reflected a 37% tax rate, was $78 million compared to $88 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2003, which reflected a 20% tax rate, and $54 million of net income in the third quarter of 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.42 compared with $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $0.29 in the third quarter of 2004. Total revenue for fiscal 2004 was $1.8 billion, up 65% from $1.1 billion in 2003. Product revenues were $1.6 billion, up 63% from $1.0 billion in 2003. License and royalty revenues were $174 million, up 79% from $97 million in 2003. Net income was $267 million, up 58% from net income of $169 million in 2003. The provision for income tax was 37% for 2004 compared to 30% in 2003. Fully diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2004 were $1.44, compared to $1.02 in 2003. "SanDisk experienced outstanding results in our fourth quarter due to strong demand for our products in digital cameras, USB flash drives, mobile handsets and our new line of flash digital audio players," said SanDisk CEO Eli Harari. "In the fourth quarter we sold 110% more megabytes than in the prior quarter by successfully shifting consumer preference to our higher capacity cards. Higher yields on our 90-nanometer NAND/MLC, and higher unit volumes allowed us to aggressively reduce our costs and improve operating margins by almost 3% in the quarter despite a 34% sequential decline in the average price per megabyte." "In 2005 we will continue our focus on three areas. First, driving growth in our target consumer and handset markets, including the new storage opportunities in handsets, flash digital audio players, video games, second generation intelligent flash drives, and crypto-secure cards. Second, building our brand and expanding our global sales channels beyond 100,000 storefronts. Third, executing the transition of our captive volume production from 90-nanometer to 70-nanometer NAND/MLC, as well as ramping the new 300-millimeter flash fab, both currently scheduled to commence in the second half
of 2005. I am optimistic about the rapidly expanding and pervasive use of our storage technology and products in numerous emerging markets and applications over the next several years." FINANCIAL RESULTS AND HIGHLIGHTS o Revenue was a record $549 million in the fourth quarter, up 35% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. o Megabytes sold in the fourth quarter increased a record 110% sequentially and increased 228% year-over-year. Total megabytes sold in 2004 were approximately 167% higher than in 2003. o Units sold in the fourth quarter increased 45% sequentially and increased 55% year-over-year. Units sold in 2004 were 53% higher than in 2003. o Average density per card sold in retail increased to 356Megabytes (MB) in the fourth quarter from 254MB in the third quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
SUNNYVALE, CA, April 21, 2005  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the first quarter ended April 3, 2005. Total first quarter revenues increased 17% on a year-over-year basis to $451 million. First quarter net income was $75 million, up 17% compared to $64 million in the first quarter of 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.39, up 15% compared with $0.34 in the first quarter of 2004.
"The first quarter was another good quarter for SanDisk coming off of the strong fourth quarter holiday sales. We are particularly pleased with this quarter's profitability. Shipments from 90-nanometer chips increased to more than 80% of our first quarter's captive supply as 90-nanometer yields exceeded our expectations. Our product gross margins grew to 37%, driven by our increased 90-nanometer output and a modest 10% sequential decline in the average price per megabyte. Industry-wide supply for NAND memory is currently well balanced with growing demand from existing applications and new markets. Demand in the first quarter was exceptionally strong for our high capacity cards, and royalty revenues grew nicely reflecting the continuing growth of the NAND flash market for our licensees," said SanDisk CEO Eli Harari. "As we move forward in 2005, we believe SanDisk is well positioned to continue expanding into new markets such as the emerging market for our flash cards in handsets, the digital flash music player market and the exciting market for our cards in video game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation Portable."

     At the 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") held on May 27, 2005 (the "Annual Meeting"), the stockholders approved the SanDisk Corporation 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan and the various ancillary documents under the Plan are attached hereto and are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.
     The Plan consists of three separate equity incentive programs: (i) the discretionary grant program under which eligible individuals may be granted options to purchase shares of the Registrant's common stock ("Common Stock") at the fair market value per share on the grant date or stock appreciation rights with a base price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the grant date, (ii) the stock issuance program under which eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards which vest upon completion of a designated service period or the attainment of pre-established performance milestones and (iii) the automatic grant program for the non-employee members of the Registrant's board of directors pursuant to which new and continuing non-employee board members are to receive grants (in the form of stock options and/or restricted stock or restricted stock units) automatically at periodic intervals over their period of board service. Participation in the discretionary grant and stock issuance programs is limited to employees of the Registrant and its subsidiaries, non-employee members of the Registrant's board of directors or the board of directors of any subsidiary, and consultants and other independent advisors in the service of the Registrant or any subsidiary
     5,700,000 shares of Common Stock have been initially reserved for issuance over the term of the Plan. The share reserve may be increased by up to an additional 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the extent any options outstanding under the Registrant's 1995 Stock Option Plan ("1995 Plan") or the Registrant's 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan ("Directors Plan") at the time of the Annual Meeting subsequently expire or terminate unexercised. No participant in the Plan may receive option grants, stand-alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances (whether vested or unvested) or other stock-based awards for more than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in any single calendar year, subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions. The maximum number of shares which may be issued without cash consideration under the stock issuance program may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock from time to time authorized for issuance under the Plan.
     The plan administrator will have full power and authority (subject to the express terms of the Plan) to select the individuals who are to receive awards under the discretionary grant and stock issuance programs and to determine the time or times when those awards are to be made, the number of shares and the vesting schedule applicable to each award and the remaining terms and conditions of each such award. The plan administrator will also have the discretionary authority to accelerate the vesting of any and all outstanding awards under the two programs. Awards under the automatic option grant program will be made in accordance with the express terms of that program, except for the limited authority of the plan administrator to determine the actual number of shares for which each such award is to be made, subject to the limitations of the program on the maximum number of shares for which awards may be made to new or continuing members of the Registrant's board of directors.
     On May 27, 2005, upon stockholder approval of the Plan at the Annual Meeting and pursuant to the terms of the automatic grant program and the limited discretion provided the plan administrator under such program, each non-employee member of the Registrant's board of directors (Irwin Federman, Catherine P. Lego, Michael E. Marks, Dr. James D. Meindl and Alan F. Shugart) was automatically granted a stock option for 6,250 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of $26.09 per share, the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the grant date, and a restricted stock unit award covering an additional 2,500 shares of Common Stock. Both the stock option grant and the restricted stock unit award made to each non-employee board member will vest upon the earlier of (i) the director's completion of one year of board service measured from the May 27, 2005 grant date or (ii) such individual's continuation in board service through the day immediately preceding the date of the 2006 annual stockholders meeting. However, the shares subject to each award will immediately vest in full upon the individual's death or disability while a board member or upon the occurrence of certain changes in ownership or control during his or her period of board service.
     On May 27, 2005, subsequent to the Annual Meeting, the compensation committee of the Registrant's board of directors granted a stock option under the Plan for 200,000 shares of Common Stock to Dr. Eli Harari, the Registrant's President and Chief Executive Officer. The option grant has an exercise price of $26.09 per share and will become exercisable with respect to (i) 25% of the option shares upon Dr. Harari's completion of 1 year of service measured from the grant date and (ii) the

balance of the option shares in successive equal quarterly installments upon his completion of each succeeding 3-month period of service over the 36-month period measured from the 1st anniversary of the grant date.
     At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders also approved the SanDisk Corporation 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the SanDisk Corporation 2005 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to a broad-based employee stock purchase program for both U.S. and foreign employees of the Registrant and its subsidiaries.

Exhibit 10.1
     
I. PURPOSE OF THE PLAN
          This 2005 Stock Incentive Plan is intended to promote the interests of SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation, by providing eligible persons in the Corporation's service with the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest, or otherwise increase their proprietary interest, in the Corporation as an incentive for them to remain in such service.
          Capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the attached Appendix.
     
II. STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN
          A. The Plan shall be divided into three separate equity incentive programs:
                the Discretionary Grant Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock or stock appreciation rights tied to the value of such Common Stock,
-
                the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be issued shares of Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards which vest upon the completion of a designated service period or the attainment of pre-established performance milestones, or such shares of Common Stock may be issued through direct purchase or as a bonus for services rendered the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary), and
-
                the Automatic Grant Program under which eligible non-employee Board members will automatically receive grants at designated intervals over their period of continued Board service.
-
          B. The provisions of Articles One and Five shall apply to all equity programs under the Plan and shall govern the interests of all persons under the Plan.
 
     
III. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN
          A. The Compensation Committee shall have sole and exclusive authority to administer the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs with respect to Section 16 Insiders. Administration of the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs with respect to all other persons eligible to participate in those programs may, at the Board's discretion, be vested in the Compensation Committee or a Secondary Board Committee, or the Board may retain the power to administer those programs with respect to all such persons. However, any discretionary option grants, stock appreciation rights, stock issuances or other stock-based awards for members of the Compensation Committee must be authorized by a disinterested majority of the Board.
          B. Members of the Compensation Committee or any Secondary Board Committee shall serve for such period of time as the Board may determine and may be removed by the Board at any time. The Board may also at any time terminate the functions of any Secondary Board Committee and reassume all powers and authority previously delegated to such committee.
          C. Each Plan Administrator shall, within the scope of its administrative functions under the Plan, have full power and authority (subject to the provisions of the Plan) to establish such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate for proper administration of the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs and to make such determinations under, and issue such interpretations of, the provisions of those programs and any outstanding options, stock appreciation rights, stock issuances or other stock-based awards thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable. Decisions of the Plan Administrator within the scope of its administrative functions under the Plan shall be final and binding on all parties who have an interest in the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs under its jurisdiction or any stock option, stock appreciation right, stock issuance or other stock-based award thereunder.
          D. Service as a Plan Administrator by the members of the Compensation Committee or the Secondary Board Committee shall constitute service as Board members, and the members of each such committee shall accordingly be entitled to full indemnification and reimbursement as Board members for their service on such committee. No member of the Compensation Committee or the Secondary Board Committee shall be liable for any act or omission made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any option grant, stock appreciation right, stock issuance or other stock-based award thereunder under the Plan.
          E. Administration of the Automatic Grant Program shall be self-executing in accordance with the terms of that program, and no Plan Administrator shall exercise any discretionary functions with respect to any option grants or stock issuances made under that program, except that the Compensation Committee shall have the express authority to establish from time to time the specific number of shares to be subject to the initial and annual grants made to the non-employee Board members under such program.
 
     
IV. ELIGIBILITY
          A. The persons eligible to participate in the Discretionary Grant and Stock Issuance Programs are as follows:
                    (i) Employees,
                    (ii) non-employee members of the Board or the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary, and
                    (iii) consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary).
          B. The Plan Administrator shall have full authority to determine, (i) with respect to the grant of options or stock appreciation rights under the Discretionary Grant Program, which eligible persons are to receive such grants, the time or times when those grants are to be made, the number of shares to be covered by each such grant, the time or times when the grant is to become exercisable, the vesting schedule (if any) applicable to the granted option or stock appreciation right, the maximum term for which such option or stock appreciation right is to remain outstanding and the status of a granted option as either an Incentive Option or a Non-Statutory Option and (ii) with respect to stock issuances or other stock-based awards under the Stock Issuance Program, which eligible persons are to receive such issuances or awards, the time or times when the issuances or awards are to be made, the number of shares subject to each such issuance or award, the vesting and issuance schedules applicable to the shares which are the subject of such issuance or award and the consideration for those shares.
          C. The Plan Administrator shall have the absolute discretion either to grant options or stock appreciation rights in accordance with the Discretionary Grant Program or to effect stock issuances and other stock-based awards in accordance with the Stock Issuance Program.
          D. The individuals who shall be eligible to participate in the Automatic Grant Program shall be limited to (i) those individuals who first become non-employee Board members on or after the Plan Effective Date, whether through appointment by the Board or election by the Corporation's stockholders, and (ii) those individuals who continue to serve as non-employee Board members on or after the Plan Effective Date. A non-employee Board member who has previously been in the employ of the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary) shall not be eligible to receive a grant under the Automatic Grant Program at the time he or she first becomes a non-employee Board member, but shall be eligible to receive periodic grants under the Automatic Grant Program while he or she continues to serve as a non-employee Board member.
 
     
V. STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
          A. The stock issuable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including shares repurchased by the Corporation on the open market. The number of shares of Common Stock initially reserved for issuance over the term of the Plan shall be limited to five million seven hundred thousand (5,700,000) shares. The Plan shall serve as the successor to the two Predecessor Plans, and no further stock option grants shall be made under those Predecessor Plans on or after the Plan Effective Date. However, all options outstanding under the Predecessor Plans on the Plan Effective Date shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and no provision of this Plan shall be deemed to affect or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of those options with respect to their acquisition of shares of Common Stock thereunder. To the extent any options outstanding under the Predecessor Plans on the Plan Effective Date expire or terminate unexercised, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to those expired or terminated options at the time of expiration or termination shall be added to the share reserve under this Plan and shall accordingly be available for issuance hereunder, up to a maximum of an additional ten million (10,000,000) shares.
          B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued without cash consideration pursuant to the Stock Issuance Program shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock from time to time authorized for issuance under the Plan, including (without limitation): (i) any shares added to the Plan reserve by reason of the expiration or termination of outstanding options under the Predecessor Plans prior to exercise, (ii) any increases to the Plan reserve from time to time approved by the Corporation's stockholders and (iii) any adjustments to the authorized share reserve effected in accordance with Section V.E. of this Article One.
          C. No one person participating in the Plan may receive stock options, stand-alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances (whether vested or unvested) or other stock-based awards (whether in the form of restricted stock units or other share-right awards) for more than one million (1,000,000) shares of Common Stock in the aggregate per calendar year.
          D. Shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding options or other awards made under the Plan shall be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan to the extent those options or awards expire or terminate for any reason prior to the issuance of the shares of Common Stock subject to those options or awards. Unvested shares issued under the Plan and subsequently forfeited or repurchased by the Corporation, at a price per share not greater than the original issue price paid per share, pursuant to the Corporation's repurchase rights under the Plan shall be added back to the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan and shall accordingly be available for subsequent reissuance. Should the exercise price of an option under the Plan be paid with shares of Common Stock, then the authorized reserve of Common Stock under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which that option is exercised, and not by the net number of shares issued under the exercised stock option.
 
If shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under the Plan are withheld by the Corporation in satisfaction of the withholding taxes incurred in connection with the exercise of an option or stock appreciation right or the issuance of fully-vested shares under the Stock Issuance Program, then the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares issuable under the exercised stock option or stock appreciation right or the gross number of fully-vested shares issuable under the Stock Issuance Program, calculated in each instance prior to any such share withholding.
          E. If any change is made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Plan Administrator to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities by which the share under the Plan may increase by reason of the expiration or termination of unexercised options under the Predecessor Plans, (iii) the maximum number and/or class of securities which may be issued without cash consideration under the Stock Issuance Program, (iv) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted stock options, stand-alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances and other stock-based awards under the Plan per calendar year, (v) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which grants may subsequently be made under the Automatic Grant Program to new and continuing non-employee Board members, (vi) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise or base price per share in effect under each outstanding option or stock appreciation right under the Plan and (vii) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding restricted stock unit or other stock-based award under the Plan and the issue price (if any) payable per share. Such adjustments to the outstanding options, stock appreciation rights or other stock-based awards are to be effected in a manner which shall preclude the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under those options, stock appreciation rights or other stock-based awards. The adjustments determined by the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive.
          F. Outstanding awards granted pursuant to the Plan shall in no way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
 
     
I. OPTION TERMS

               (i) cash or check made payable to the Corporation,

               (iii) to the extent the option is exercised for vested shares, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which the Optionee shall concurrently provide instructions to (a) a brokerage firm (reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation for purposes of administering such procedure in compliance with the Corporation's pre-clearance/pre-notification policies) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and (b) the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm on such settlement date in order to complete the sale.

          B. Each option shall be exercisable at such time or times, during such period and for such number of shares as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the documents evidencing the option.

Exercise and Term of Options
.
          C. .
Effect of Termination of Service
               1. The following provisions shall govern the exercise of any options granted pursuant to the Discretionary Grant Program that are outstanding at the time of the Optionee's cessation of Service or death:
               (i) Any option outstanding at the time of the Optionee's cessation of Service for any reason shall remain exercisable for such period of time thereafter as shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the documents evidencing the option, but no such option shall be exercisable after the expiration of the option term.
               (ii) Any option held by the Optionee at the time of the Optionee's death and exercisable in whole or in part at that time may be subsequently exercised by the personal representative of the Optionee's estate or by the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to the Optionee's will or the laws of inheritance or by the Optionee's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of that option.
               (iii) Should the Optionee's Service be terminated for Misconduct or should the Optionee otherwise engage in Misconduct while holding one or more outstanding options granted under this Article Two, then all of those options shall terminate immediately and cease to be outstanding.
               (iv) During the applicable post-Service exercise period, the option may not be exercised for more than the number of vested shares for which the option is at the time exercisable. No additional shares shall vest under the option following the Optionee's cessation of Service, except to the extent (if any) specifically authorized by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion pursuant to an express written agreement with the Optionee. Upon the expiration of the applicable exercise period or (if earlier) upon the expiration of the option term, the option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any shares for which the option has not been exercised.
               2. The Plan Administrator shall have complete discretion, exercisable either at the time an option is granted or at any time while the option remains outstanding, to:
               (i) extend the period of time for which the option is to remain exercisable following the Optionee's cessation of Service from the limited exercise period otherwise in effect for that option to such greater period of time as
 
the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate, but in no event beyond the expiration of the option term,
               (ii) include an automatic extension provision whereby the specified post-Service exercise period in effect for any option granted under this Article Two shall automatically be extended by an additional period of time equal in duration to any interval within the specified post-Service exercise period during which the exercise of that option or the immediate sale of the shares acquired under such option could not be effected in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, but in no event shall such an extension result in the continuation of such option beyond the expiration date of the term of that option, and/or
               (iii) permit the option to be exercised, during the applicable post-Service exercise period, not only with respect to the number of vested shares of Common Stock for which such option is exercisable at the time of the Optionee's cessation of Service but also with respect to one or more additional installments in which the Optionee would have vested had the Optionee continued in Service.
          D. The holder of an option shall have no stockholder rights with respect to the shares subject to the option until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the exercise price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares.
Stockholder Rights

          E. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to grant options which are exercisable for unvested shares of Common Stock. Should the Optionee cease Service while such shares are unvested, the Corporation shall have the right to repurchase any or all of those unvested shares at a price per share equal to the of (i) the exercise price paid per share or (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock at the time of repurchase. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable (including the period and procedure for exercise and the appropriate vesting schedule for the purchased shares) shall be established by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right.

Incentive Options
               (ii) . Non-Statutory Options shall be subject to the same limitation on transfer as Incentive Options, except that the Plan Administrator may structure one or more Non-Statutory Options so that the option may be assigned in whole or in part during the Optionee's lifetime to one or more Family Members of the Optionee or to a trust
Non-Statutory Options
 
established exclusively for one or more such Family Members, to the extent such assignment is in connection with the Optionee's estate plan or pursuant to a domestic relations order. The assigned portion may only be exercised by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to the assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for the option immediately prior to such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate.
               (iii) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Optionee may designate one or more persons as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of his or her outstanding options under this Article Two (whether Incentive Options or Non-Statutory Options), and those options shall, in accordance with such designation, automatically be transferred to such beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the Optionee's death while holding those options. Such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall take the transferred options subject to all the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement evidencing each such transferred option, including (without limitation) the limited time period during which the option may be exercised following the Optionee's death.

               To the extent the Employee holds two (2) or more such options which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year, then for purposes of the foregoing limitations on the exercisability of those options as Incentive Options, such options shall be deemed to become first exercisable in that calendar year on the basis of the chronological order in which they were granted, except to the extent otherwise provided under applicable law or regulation.
          C. If any Employee to whom an Incentive Option is granted is a 10% Stockholder, then the exercise price per share shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the option grant date, and the option term shall not exceed five (5) years measured from the option grant date.

III. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
          A. . The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority, exercisable in its sole discretion, to grant stock appreciation rights in accordance with this Section III to selected Optionees or other individuals eligible to receive option grants under the Discretionary Grant Program.
Authority

Types
          C. . The following terms and conditions shall govern the grant and exercise of Tandem Rights.
Tandem Rights
               1. One or more Optionees may be granted a Tandem Right, exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may establish, to elect between the exercise of the underlying option for shares of Common Stock or the surrender of that option in exchange for a distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value (on the option surrender date) of the number of shares in which the Optionee is at the time vested under the surrendered option (or surrendered portion thereof) over (ii) the aggregate exercise price payable for such vested shares.
               2. No such option surrender shall be effective unless it is approved by the Plan Administrator, either at the time of the actual option surrender or at any earlier time. If the surrender is so approved, then the distribution to which the Optionee shall accordingly become entitled under this Section III shall be made in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the option surrender date.
               3. If the surrender of an option is not approved by the Plan Administrator, then the Optionee shall retain whatever rights the Optionee had under the surrendered option (or surrendered portion thereof) on the option surrender date and may exercise such rights at any time prior to the of (i) five (5) business days after the receipt of the rejection notice or (ii) the last day on which the option is otherwise exercisable in accordance with the terms of the instrument evidencing such option, but in no event may such rights be exercised more than seven (7) years after the date of the option grant.
later
          D. . The following terms and conditions shall govern the grant and exercise of Stand-alone Rights:
Stand-Alone Rights
               1. One or more individuals eligible to participate in the Discretionary Grant Program may be granted a Stand-alone Right not tied to any underlying option under this Discretionary Grant Program. The Stand-alone Right shall relate to a specified number of shares of Common Stock and shall be exercisable upon such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may establish. In no event, however, may the Stand-alone Right have a maximum term in excess of seven (7) years measured from the grant date. Upon exercise of the Stand-
 
alone Right, the holder shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the Corporation in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the exercise date) of the shares of Common Stock underlying the exercised right over (ii) the aggregate base price in effect for those shares.
               2. The number of shares of Common Stock underlying each Stand-alone Right and the base price in effect for those shares shall be determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion at the time the Stand-alone Right is granted. In no event, however, may the base price per share be less than the Fair Market Value per underlying share of Common Stock on the grant date. In the event outstanding Stand-alone Rights are to be assumed in connection with a Change in Control transaction or otherwise continued in effect, the shares of Common Stock underlying each such Stand-alone Right shall be adjusted immediately after such Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which those shares of Common Stock would have been converted in consummation of such Change in Control had those shares actually been outstanding at that time. Appropriate adjustments to reflect such Change in Control shall also be made to the base price per share in effect under each outstanding Stand-alone Right, the aggregate base price shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding Stand-alone Rights under the Discretionary Grant Program, substitute, for the securities underlying those assumed rights, one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control transaction.

               3. Stand-alone Rights shall be subject to the same transferability restrictions applicable to Non-Statutory Options and may not be transferred during the holder's lifetime, except if such assignment is in connection with the holder's estate plan and is to one or more Family Members of the holder or to a trust established for the holder and/or one or more such Family Members or pursuant to a domestic relations order covering the Stand-alone Right as marital property. In addition, one or more beneficiaries may be designated for an outstanding Stand-alone Right in accordance with substantially the same terms and provisions as set forth in Section I.F of this Article Two.
               4. The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-alone Right shall be made in shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date.
               5. The holder of a Stand-alone Right shall have no stockholder rights with respect to the shares subject to the Stand-alone Right unless and until such person shall have exercised the Stand-alone Right and become a holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issued upon the exercise of such Stand-alone Right.
          E. . The provisions governing the exercise of Tandem and Stand-alone Rights following the cessation of the recipient's Service shall be substantially the same as those set forth in Section I.C of this Article Two for the options granted under the
Post-Service Exercise
 
Discretionary Grant Program, and the Plan Administrator's discretionary authority under Section I.C.2 of this Article Two shall also extend to any outstanding Tandem or Stand-alone Appreciation Rights.
F. Upon the exercise of any Tandem or Stand-alone Right under this Section III, the share reserve under Section V of Article One shall be reduced by the gross number of shares as to which such right is exercised, and not by the net number of shares actually issued by the Corporation upon such exercise.

IV. CHANGE IN CONTROL/HOSTILE TAKE-OVER
          A. In the event of a Change in Control, each outstanding option or stock appreciation right under the Discretionary Grant Program shall automatically accelerate so that each such option or stock appreciation right shall, immediately prior to the effective date of that Change in Control, become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to such option or stock appreciation right and may be exercised as to any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock. However, an outstanding option or stock appreciation right shall become exercisable on such an accelerated basis if and to the extent: (i) such option or stock appreciation right is to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or is otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such option or stock appreciation right is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing at the time of the Change in Control on any shares as to which the option or stock appreciation right is not otherwise at that time exercisable and provides for subsequent payout of that spread in accordance with the same exercise/vesting schedule applicable to those shares or (iii) the acceleration of such option or stock appreciation right is subject to other limitations imposed by the Plan Administrator.
not
          B. All outstanding repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program shall automatically terminate, and the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall immediately vest in full, in the event of a Change in Control, except to the extent: (i) those repurchase rights are to be assigned to the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or are otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such accelerated vesting is precluded by other limitations imposed by the Plan Administrator.
          C. Immediately following the consummation of the Change in Control, all outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Discretionary Grant Program shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.
 
          D. Each option which is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to the Optionee in consummation of such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Change in Control. Appropriate adjustments to reflect such Change in Control shall also be made to (i) the exercise price payable per share under each outstanding option, the aggregate exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same, (ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities available for issuance over the remaining term of the Plan (iii) the maximum number and/or class of securities by which the share reserve under this Plan may be increased by reason of the expiration or termination of unexercised options under the Predecessor Plans, (iv) the maximum number and/or class of securities which may be issued without cash consideration under the Stock Issuance Program and (v) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted stock options, stand-alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances and other stock-based awards under the Plan per calendar year. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding options under the Discretionary Grant Program, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction.
provided
          E. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those options or stock appreciation rights shall, immediately prior to the effective date of a Change in Control, become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to those options or stock appreciation rights and may be exercised as to any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock, whether or not those options or stock appreciation rights are to be assumed in the Change in Control transaction or otherwise continued in effect. In addition, the Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more of the Corporation's repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those rights shall immediately terminate upon the consummation of the Change in Control transaction, and the shares subject to those terminated rights shall thereupon vest in full.
          F. The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority to structure one or more outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those options or stock appreciation rights shall become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to those options or stock appreciation rights in the event the Optionee's Service is subsequently terminated by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of any Change in Control transaction in which those options or stock appreciation rights do not otherwise fully accelerate. In addition, the Plan Administrator may structure one or more of the Corporation's repurchase rights so that
 
those rights shall immediately terminate with respect to any shares held by the Optionee at the time of such Involuntary Termination, and the shares subject to those terminated repurchase rights shall accordingly vest in full at that time.
          G. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those options or stock appreciation rights shall, immediately prior to the effective date of a Hostile Take-Over, become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to those options or stock appreciation rights and may be exercised as to any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock. In addition, the Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more of the Corporation's repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those rights shall terminate automatically upon the consummation of such Hostile Take-Over, and the shares subject to those terminated rights shall thereupon vest in full. Alternatively, the Plan Administrator may condition the automatic acceleration of one or more outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Discretionary Grant Program and the termination of one or more of the Corporation's outstanding repurchase rights under such program upon the subsequent termination of the Optionee's Service by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of such Hostile Take-Over.
          H. The portion of any Incentive Option accelerated in connection with a Change in Control or Hostile Take-Over shall remain exercisable as an Incentive Option only to the extent the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation is not exceeded. To the extent such dollar limitation is exceeded, the accelerated portion of such option shall be exercisable as a Non-statutory Option under the Federal tax laws.
     
V. PROHIBITION ON REPRICING PROGRAMS
          The Plan Administrator shall not (i) implement any cancellation/regrant program pursuant to which outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Plan are cancelled and new options or stock appreciation rights are granted in replacement with a lower exercise price per share, (ii) cancel outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Plan with exercise prices per share in excess of the then current Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock for consideration payable in equity securities of the Corporation or (iii) otherwise directly reduce the exercise price in effect for outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Plan, without in each such instance obtaining stockholder approval.
 
     
I. STOCK ISSUANCE TERMS
          Shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program, either as vested or unvested shares, through direct and immediate issuances without any intervening option grants. Each such stock issuance shall be evidenced by a Stock Issuance Agreement which complies with the terms specified below. Shares of Common Stock may also be issued under the Stock Issuance Program pursuant to share right awards or restricted stock units which entitle the recipients to receive the shares underlying those awards or units upon the attainment of designated performance goals or the satisfaction of specified Service requirements or upon the expiration of a designated time period following the vesting of those awards or units.
          The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued without cash consideration under the Stock Issuance Program (whether as direct stock issuances or pursuant to restricted stock units or other share-right awards) may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock from time to time authorized for issuance under the Plan, including (without limitation): (i) any shares added to the Plan reserve by reason of the expiration or termination of outstanding options under the Predecessor Plans prior to exercise, (ii) any increases to the Plan reserve from time to time approved by the Corporation's stockholders and (iii) any adjustments to the authorized share reserve effected in accordance with Section V.E. of Article One.
          A. .
Issue Price
               1. The issue price per share shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator, but shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the issuance date.
               2. Shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program for any of the following items of consideration which the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in each individual instance:
               (i) cash or check made payable to the Corporation,
               (ii) past services rendered to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary); or
               (iii) any other valid consideration under the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
          B. .
Vesting Provisions
               1. Shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program may, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be fully and immediately vested upon issuance or may vest in one or more installments over the Participant's period of Service or upon the attainment of specified performance objectives. The elements of the vesting schedule applicable to any unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and incorporated into the Stock Issuance Agreement. Shares of Common Stock may also be issued under the Stock Issuance Program pursuant to share right awards or restricted stock units which entitle the recipients to receive the shares underlying those awards or units upon the attainment of designated performance goals or the satisfaction of specified Service requirements or upon the expiration of a designated time period following the vesting of those awards or units, including (without limitation) a deferred distribution date following the termination of the Participant's Service.
               2. The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section 162(m), to structure one or more stock issuances or restricted stock unit or share right awards so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those issuances or awards shall vest (or vest and become issuable) upon the achievement of certain pre-established corporate performance goals based on one or more of the following criteria: (1) return on total stockholder equity; (2) earnings per share of Common Stock; (3) net income or operating income (before or after taxes); (4) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (5) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and charges for stock-based compensation, (6) sales or revenue targets; (7) return on assets, capital or investment; (8) cash flow; (9) market share; (10) cost reduction goals; (11) budget comparisons; (12) measures of customer satisfaction; (13) any combination of, or a specified increase in, any of the foregoing; (14) new product development or successful completion of research and development projects; and (15) the formation of joint ventures, research or development collaborations, or the completion of other corporate transactions intended to enhance the Corporation's revenue or profitability or enhance its customer base. In addition, such performance goals may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of the Corporation's performance under one or more of the measures described above relative to the performance of other entities and may also be based on the performance of any of the Corporation's business units or divisions or any Parent or Subsidiary. Performance goals may include a minimum threshold level of performance below which no award will be earned, levels of performance at which specified portions of an award will be earned and a maximum level of performance at which an award will be fully earned.
               3. Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including money paid other than as a regular cash dividend) which the Participant may have the right to receive with respect to the Participant's unvested shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's
 
receipt of consideration shall be issued subject to (i) the same vesting requirements applicable to the Participant's unvested shares of Common Stock and (ii) such escrow arrangements as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate.
               4. The Participant shall have full stockholder rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant under the Stock Issuance Program, whether or not the Participant's interest in those shares is vested. Accordingly, the Participant shall have the right to vote such shares and to receive any dividends paid on such shares, subject to any applicable vesting requirements. The Participant shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to a restricted stock unit or share right award until that award vests and the shares of Common Stock are actually issued thereunder. However, dividend-equivalent units may be paid or credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom shares of Common Stock, on outstanding restricted stock unit or share right awards, subject to such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate.
               5. Should the Participant cease to remain in Service while holding one or more unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program or should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested shares of Common Stock, then those shares shall be immediately surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, and the Participant shall have no further stockholder rights with respect to those shares. To the extent the surrendered shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration paid in cash or cash equivalent, the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the of (i) the cash consideration paid for the surrendered shares or (ii) the Fair Market Value of those shares at the time of cancellation.
lower
               6. The Plan Administrator may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested shares of Common Stock which would otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant's Service or the non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those shares. Any such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant's interest in the shares of Common Stock as to which the waiver applies. Such waiver may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant's cessation of Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance objectives. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of performance objectives may be waived with respect to shares which were intended at the time of issuance to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except in the event of the Participant's Involuntary Termination or as otherwise provided in Section II of this Article Three.
               7. Outstanding share right awards or restricted stock units under the Stock Issuance Program shall automatically terminate, and no shares of Common Stock shall actually be issued in satisfaction of those awards or units, if the performance goals or Service requirements established for such awards or units are not attained or satisfied. The Plan Administrator, however, shall have the discretionary authority to issue vested shares of Common Stock under one or more outstanding share right awards or restricted stock units as to which the designated performance goals or Service requirements have not been attained or satisfied.
 
However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of performance goals may be waived with respect to awards or units which were intended, at the time those awards or units were granted, to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except in the event of the Participant's Involuntary Termination or as otherwise provided in Section II of this Article Three.
     
II. CHANGE IN CONTROL/HOSTILE TAKE-OVER
          A. All of the Corporation's outstanding repurchase rights under the Stock Issuance Program shall terminate automatically, and all the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall immediately vest in full, in the event of any Change in Control, except to the extent (i) those repurchase rights are to be assigned to the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or are otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such accelerated vesting is precluded by other limitations imposed in the Stock Issuance Agreement.
          B. Each outstanding restricted stock unit or share right award assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect shall be adjusted immediately after the consummation of that Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which the shares of Common Stock subject to the award immediately prior to the Change in Control would have been converted in consummation of such Change in Control had those shares actually been outstanding at that time, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the consideration (if any) payable per share thereunder, provided the aggregate amount of such consideration shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding restricted stock units or share right awards, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction.
          C. If any such restricted stock unit or share right award is not assumed or otherwise continued in effect or replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares of Common Stock at the time of the Change in Control and provides for the subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting schedule applicable to those shares, then such unit or award shall vest, and the shares of Common Stock subject to that unit or award shall be issued as fully-vested shares, immediately prior to the consummation of the Change in Control.
          D. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more unvested stock issuances or one or more restricted stock unit or other share right awards under the Stock Issuance Program so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those issuances or awards shall automatically vest (or vest and become issuable) in whole or in part immediately upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or upon the subsequent termination of the Participant's Service by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of that Change in Control transaction.
 
          E. The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority to structure one or more unvested stock issuances or one or more restricted stock unit or other share right awards under the Stock Issuance Program so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those issuances or awards shall automatically vest (or vest and become issuable) in whole or in part immediately upon the occurrence of a Hostile Take-Over or upon the subsequent termination of the Participant's Service by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of that Hostile Take-Over.
          F. The Plan Administrator's authority under Paragraphs D and E of this Section II shall also extend to any stock issuances, restricted stock units or other share right awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), even though the automatic vesting of those issuances, units or awards pursuant to Paragraph D or E of this Section II may result in their loss of performance-based status under Code Section 162(m).
 
I. OPTION TERMS
          A. The Automatic Grant Program under this Article Four shall supersede and replace the Corporation's 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, and no further stock option grants shall be made under that plan on or after the Plan Effective Date. However, all options outstanding under that plan on the Plan Effective Date shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and no provision of this Plan shall be deemed to affect or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of those options with respect to their acquisition of shares of Common Stock thereunder.

The actual number of shares for which such initial option grant shall be made shall (subject to the 150,000-share limit) be determined by the Plan Administrator at the time of each such grant.
Initial Grant:
               2. On the date of each annual stockholders meeting, beginning with the 2005 Annual Meeting, each individual who is to continue to serve as a non-employee Board member, whether or not that individual is standing for re-election to the Board at that particular annual meeting, shall automatically be granted a Non-Statutory Option to purchase not more than forty thousand (40,000) shares of Common Stock, provided that such individual has served as a non-employee Board member for a period of at least six (6) months. There shall be no limit on the number of such annual share option grants any one continuing non-employee Board member may receive over his or her period of Board service, and non-employee Board members who have previously been in the employ of the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary) shall be eligible to receive one or more such annual option grants over their period of continued Board service. The actual number of shares for which such annual option grants are made to each continuing non-employee Board member shall (subject to the 40,000-share limit) be determined by the Plan Administrator on or before the date of the annual stockholders meeting on which those grants are to be made.

Option Term
.
          D. Each option shall be immediately exercisable for any or all of the option shares. However, any unvested shares purchased under the option shall be subject to repurchase by the Corporation, at the of (i) the exercise price paid per share or (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock at the time of repurchase, upon the Optionee's cessation of Service prior to vesting in those shares. The shares subject to each initial 150,000-share-or-less grant shall vest, and the Corporation's repurchase right shall lapse, in four (4) successive equal annual installments upon the Optionee's completion of each year of Service (whether as a non-employee Board member, Employee or consultant) over the four (4)-year period measured from the option grant date. The shares subject to each annual 40,000-share-or-less grant made to a non-employee Board member for his or her continued Board service shall vest, and the Corporation's repurchase right shall lapse, in one installment upon the of (i) the Optionee's completion of the one (1)-year period of Service (whether as a non-employee Board member, Employee or consultant) measured from the grant date or (ii) the Optionee's continuation in such Service capacity through the day immediately preceding the next annual stockholders meeting following such grant date.

earlier
          E. Each option under this Article Four may be assigned in whole or in part during the Optionee's lifetime to one or more of his or her Family Members or to a trust established exclusively for the Optionee and/or one or more such Family Members, to the extent such assignment is in connection with the Optionee's estate plan or pursuant to a domestic relations order. The assigned portion may only be exercised by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to the assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for the option immediately prior to such assignment and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate. The Optionee may also designate one or more persons as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of his or her outstanding options under this Article Four, and the options shall, in accordance with such designation, automatically be transferred to such beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the Optionee's death while holding those options. Such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall take the transferred options subject to all the terms and conditions of the applicable agreement evidencing each such transferred option, including (without limitation) the limited time period during which the option may be exercised following the Optionee's death.
Limited Transferability of Options
.
 
          F. The following provisions shall govern the exercise of any options held by the Optionee at the time the Optionee ceases Service:
Termination of Board Service
.
               (i) The Optionee (or, in the event of Optionee's death while holding the option, the personal representative of the Optionee's estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to the Optionee's will or the laws of inheritance or the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of such option) shall have a twelve (12)-month period following the date of such cessation of Service in which to exercise such option.
               (ii) During the twelve (12)-month exercise period, the option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of vested shares of Common Stock for which the option is exercisable at the time of the Optionee's cessation of Service. However, should the Optionee cease to serve as a Board member by reason of death or Permanent Disability, then all shares at the time subject to the option shall immediately vest so that such option may, during the twelve (12)-month exercise period following such cessation of Board service, be exercised for any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock.
               (iii) In no event shall the option remain exercisable after the expiration of the option term. Upon the expiration of the twelve (12)-month exercise period or (if earlier) upon the expiration of the option term, the option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested shares for which the option has not been exercised. However, the option shall, immediately upon the Optionee's cessation of Service for any reason (other than cessation of Board service by reason of death or Permanent Disability), terminate and cease to be outstanding to the extent the option is not otherwise at that time exercisable for vested shares.
     
II. CHANGE IN CONTROL/HOSTILE TAKE-OVER
          A. Should a Change in Control occur prior to the Optionee's cessation of Service, then the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to each outstanding option held by such Optionee under this Automatic Grant Program but not otherwise vested shall automatically vest in full so that each such option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control, become exercisable for all the option shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock and may be exercised for any or all of those vested shares. Immediately following the consummation of the Change in Control, each automatic option grant shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.
 
          B. Should a Hostile Take-Over occur prior to the Optionee's cessation of Service, then the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to each outstanding option held by such Optionee under this Automatic Grant Program but not otherwise vested shall automatically vest in full so that each such option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of the Hostile Take-Over, become exercisable for all the option shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock and may be exercised for any or all of those vested shares. Each such option shall remain exercisable for such fully vested option shares until the expiration or sooner termination of the option term.
          C. All outstanding repurchase rights under this under this Automatic Grant Program shall automatically terminate, and the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall immediately vest in full, in the event of any Change in Control or Hostile Take-Over.
          D. Each option which is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to the Optionee in consummation of such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Change in Control. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the exercise price payable per share under each outstanding option, the aggregate exercise price payable for such securities shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding options under the Automatic Grant Program, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction.
provided
     
III. REMAINING TERMS
          The remaining terms of each grant shall be the same as the terms in effect for option grants made under the Discretionary Grant Program.
     
IV. ALTERNATIVE AWARDS
          The Compensation Committee shall have full power and authority to award, in lieu of one or more initial or annual automatic option grants under this Article Four, unvested shares of Common Stock or restricted stock units which in each instance have an aggregate Fair Market Value substantially equal to the fair value (as determined for financial reporting purposes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard 123R or any successor standard) of the automatic option grant which such award replaces. Any such alternative award shall be made at the same time the automatic option grant which it replaces would have been made, and the vesting provisions (including vesting acceleration) applicable to such award shall be substantially the same as in effect for the automatic option grant so replaced.
 
     
I. TAX WITHHOLDING
          A. The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of options or stock appreciation rights or the issuance or vesting of such shares under the Plan shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable income and employment tax withholding requirements.

          A. The Board shall have complete and exclusive power and authority to amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects.

          B. The Compensation Committee of the Board shall have the discretionary authority to adopt and implement from time to time such addenda or subplans to the Plan as it may deem necessary in order to bring the Plan into compliance with applicable laws and regulations of any foreign jurisdictions in which grants or awards are to be made under the Plan and/or to obtain favorable tax treatment in those foreign jurisdictions for the individuals to whom the grants or awards are made.
          C. Options and stock appreciation rights may be granted under the Discretionary Grant Program and stock-based awards may be made under the Stock Issuance Program that in each instance involve shares of Common Stock in excess of the number of shares then available for issuance under the Plan, provided no shares shall actually be issued pursuant to those grants or awards until the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under
 
the Plan is sufficiently increased by stockholder approval of an amendment of the Plan authorizing such increase. If stockholder approval is required and is not obtained within twelve (12) months after the date the first excess grant or award made against such contingent increase, then any options, stock appreciation rights or other stock-based awards granted on the basis of such excess shares shall terminate and cease to be outstanding.

Any such right to exercise this option shall lapse, and this option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the twelve (12)-month period following the date of Optionee's death or (ii) the Expiration Date.
               (c) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Permanent Disability while this option is outstanding, then Optionee (or any person or persons to whom this option is transferred pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph 3) shall have a period of twelve (12) months (commencing with the first day following such cessation of Service) during which to exercise this option. In no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date.
               (d) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, this option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of Option Shares for which this option is, at the time of Optionee's cessation of Service, vested and exercisable pursuant to the Exercise Schedule specified in the Grant Notice or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Paragraph 6. This option shall not vest or become exercisable for any additional Option Shares,
 
whether pursuant to the normal Exercise Schedule specified in the Grant Notice or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Paragraph 6, following the Optionee's cessation of Service, except to the extent (if any) specifically authorized by the Plan Administrator pursuant to an express written agreement with the Optionee. Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any exercisable Option Shares for which the option has not otherwise been exercised.
               (e) Should Optionee's Service be terminated for Misconduct or should Optionee otherwise engage in any Misconduct while this option is outstanding, then this option shall terminate immediately and cease to remain outstanding.
          6. .
Special Acceleration of Option
               (a) This option, to the extent outstanding at the time of a Change in Control but not otherwise fully exercisable, shall automatically accelerate so that this option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of such Change in Control, become exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this option and may be exercised for any or all of those Option Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock. However, this option shall become exercisable on such an accelerated basis, if and to the extent: (i) this option is to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or is otherwise to be continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) this option is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing at the time of the Change in Control on any Option Shares for which this option is not otherwise at that time exercisable (the excess of the Fair Market Value of those Option Shares over the aggregate Exercise Price payable for such shares) and provides for subsequent payout of that spread in accordance with the same Exercise Schedule for those Option Shares as set forth in the Grant Notice.
not
               (b) Immediately following the Change in Control, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.
               (c) If this option is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect, then this option shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to Optionee in consummation of such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Change in Control, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of this option, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control, provided such common stock is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities exchange or market.
 
               (d) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
          7. . Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number and/or class of securities subject to this option and (ii) the Exercise Price in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder.
Adjustment in Option Shares
          8. . The holder of this option shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the Option Shares until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the Exercise Price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares.
Stockholder Rights
          9. .
Manner of Exercising Option
               (a) In order to exercise this option with respect to all or any part of the Option Shares for which this option is at the time exercisable, Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) must take the following actions:
                    (i) Execute and deliver to the Corporation a Notice of Exercise for the Option Shares for which the option is exercised or comply with such other procedures as the Corporation may establish for notifying the Corporation of the exercise of this option for one or more Option Shares.
                    (ii) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased shares in one or more of the following forms:
                         (A) cash or check made payable to the Corporation;

                         (C) through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable instructions (i) to a brokerage firm (reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation for purposes of administering such procedure in accordance with the Corporation's pre-clearance/pre-notification policies) to effect the
 
               Except to the extent the sale and remittance procedure is utilized in connection with the option exercise, payment of the Exercise Price must accompany the Notice of Exercise (or other notification procedure) delivered to the Corporation in connection with the option exercise.
                    (iii) Furnish to the Corporation appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this option.
                    (iv) Make appropriate arrangements with the Corporation (or Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Optionee) for the satisfaction of all applicable income and employment tax withholding requirements applicable to the option exercise.
               (b) As soon as practical after the Exercise Date, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this option) a certificate for the purchased Option Shares, with the appropriate legends affixed thereto.
               (c) In no event may this option be exercised for any fractional shares.

Compliance with Laws and Regulations
               (a) The exercise of this option and the issuance of the Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Optionee with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance.
               (b) The inability of the Corporation to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Corporation to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this option shall relieve the Corporation of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained.

If the Option Shares covered by this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of shares of Common Stock which may without stockholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this option shall be void with respect to those excess shares, unless stockholder approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.

               (b) No installment under this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option if (and to the extent) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which such installment first becomes exercisable hereunder would, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or any other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any
 
other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate. Should such One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation be exceeded in any calendar year, this option shall nevertheless become exercisable for the excess shares in such calendar year as a Non-Statutory Option.
               (c) Should the exercisability of this option be accelerated upon a Change in Control, then this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option only to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which this option first becomes exercisable in the calendar year in which the Change in Control transaction occurs does not, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or one or more other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate. Should the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation be exceeded in the calendar year of such Change in Control, the option may nevertheless be exercised for the excess shares in such calendar year as a Non-Statutory Option.
               (d) Should Optionee hold, in addition to this option, one or more other options to purchase Common Stock which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year as this option, then for purposes of the foregoing limitations on the exercisability of such options as Incentive Options, this option and each of those other options shall be deemed to become first exercisable in that calendar year, on the basis of the chronological order in which such options were granted, except to the extent otherwise provided under applicable law or regulation.

Exhibit 10.6
RECITALS
     A. The Corporation has implemented an automatic option grant program under the Plan pursuant to which eligible non-employee members of the Board will automatically receive special option grants at periodic intervals over their period of Board service in order to provide such individuals with a meaningful incentive to continue to serve as members of the Board.
     B. Optionee is an eligible non-employee Board member, and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the automatic grant of an option to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan.
     C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix.
          , it is hereby agreed as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
          1. . The Corporation hereby grants to Optionee, as of the Grant Date, a Non-Statutory Option to purchase up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Grant Notice. The Option Shares shall be purchasable from time to time during the option term specified in Paragraph 2 at the Exercise Price.
Grant of Option
          2. . This option shall have a term of seven (7) years measured from the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in accordance with Paragraph 5 or 6.
Option Term
          3. .
Limited Transferability
               (a) This option may be assigned in whole or in part during Optionee's lifetime to one or more of the Optionee's Family Members or to a trust established for the exclusive benefit of Optionee and/or one or more such Family Members, to the extent such assignment is in connection with the Optionee's estate plan or pursuant to a domestic relations order. The assigned portion shall be exercisable only by the person or persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to such assignment. The terms applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as those in effect for this option immediately prior to such assignment.
               (b) Should the Optionee die while holding this option, then this option shall be transferred in accordance with Optionee's will or the laws of inheritance. However, Optionee may designate one or more persons as the beneficiary or beneficiaries of this option, and this option shall, in accordance with such designation, automatically be transferred to such
 
beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the Optionee's death while holding this option. Such beneficiary or beneficiaries shall take the transferred option subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including (without limitation) the limited time period during which this option may, pursuant to Paragraph 5, be exercised following Optionee's death.
          4. .
Exercisability/Vesting
               (a) This option shall be immediately exercisable for any or all of the Option Shares, whether or not the Option Shares are at the time vested in accordance with the Vesting Schedule, and shall remain so exercisable until the Expiration Date or sooner termination of the option term under Paragraph 5 or 6.
               (b) Optionee shall, in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Grant Notice, vest in the Option Shares in one or more installments over his or her period of Service (whether as a non-employee Board member, Employee or consultant). The Option Shares shall, however, be subject to accelerated vesting pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 5, 6 or 7, but in no event shall any additional Option Shares vest following Optionee's cessation of Service.
          5. . Should Optionee's Service cease while this option remains outstanding, then the option term specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this option shall cease to be outstanding) prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with the following provisions:
Cessation of Service
               (a) Should Optionee cease Service for any reason (other than death or Permanent Disability) while this option is outstanding, then the period during which this option may be exercised shall be reduced to a twelve (12)-month period measured from the date of such cessation of Service, but in no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date. During such limited period of exercisability, Optionee (or the person or persons to whom this option is transferred pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph 3) may not exercise this option in the aggregate for more than the number of Option Shares (if any) in which Optionee is vested on the date of his or her cessation of Service. Upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of such twelve (12)-month period or (ii) the specified Expiration Date, the option shall terminate and cease to be exercisable with respect to any vested Option Shares for which the option has not been exercised.
               (b) Should Optionee die during the twelve (12)-month period following his or her cessation of Service but while this option is outstanding, then (i) the personal representative of Optionee's estate or (ii) the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to Optionee's will or the laws of inheritance following Optionee's death or to whom the option is transferred during Optionee's lifetime pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph 3 or (iii) the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this option (as the case may be) shall have the right to exercise this option for any or all of the Option Shares in which Optionee is vested at the time of Optionee's cessation of Service (less any Option Shares purchased by Optionee after such cessation of Service but prior to death). Any such right
 
to exercise this option shall terminate, and this option shall accordingly cease to be exercisable for such vested Option Shares, upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the twelve (12)-month period measured from the date of Optionee's cessation of Service or (ii) the specified Expiration Date.
               (c) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of death or Permanent Disability, then any Option Shares at the time subject to this option but not otherwise vested shall vest in full so that this option may be exercised for any or all of the Option Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock at any time prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the twelve (12)-month period measured from the date of Optionee's cessation of Service or (ii) the specified Expiration Date, whereupon this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding.
               (d) Upon Optionee's cessation of Service for any reason other than death or Permanent Disability, this option shall immediately terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any and all Option Shares in which Optionee is not otherwise at that time vested in accordance with the normal Vesting Schedule or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Paragraphs 6 and 7 below.
          6. .
Change in Control
               (a) Should a Change in Control occur during Optionee's period of Service, then any Option Shares at the time subject to this option but not otherwise vested shall automatically vest so that this option shall, immediately prior to the specified effective date for that Change in Control, become exercisable for all of the Option Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock and may be exercised for any or all of those vested shares. Immediately following the consummation of the Change in Control, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation or its parent company or otherwise continued in effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.
               (b) If this option is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect, then this option shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities which would have been issuable to Optionee in consummation of such Change in Control had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Change in Control, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, provided the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control transaction, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of this option, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction, provided such common stock is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities exchange or market.
 
          7. . In the event of a Hostile Take-Over effected during Optionee's period of Service, any Option Shares at the time subject to this option but not otherwise vested shall automatically vest so that this option shall, immediately prior to the effective date of that Hostile Take-Over, become exercisable for all of the Option Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock and may be exercised for any or all of those vested shares. This option shall remain exercisable for such fully vested Option Shares until the of (i) the specified Expiration Date, or (ii) the sooner termination of this option in accordance with Paragraph 5 or 6.

To the extent the option is exercised for unvested Option Shares, execute and deliver to the Corporation a Purchase Agreement for those unvested Option Shares.
                    (ii) Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased shares in one or more of the following forms:
                         (A) cash or check made payable to the Corporation,
                         (B) shares of Common Stock held by Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Corporation's earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date, or
 
                         (C) to the extent the option is exercised for vested Option Shares, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising the option) shall concurrently provide irrevocable instructions (I) to a brokerage firm (reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation for purposes of administering such procedure in accordance with the Corporation's pre-clearance/pre-notification policies) to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable income and employment taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and (II) to the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm on such settlement date in order to complete the sale.
                       (iii) Furnish to the Corporation appropriate documentation that the person or persons exercising the option (if other than Optionee) have the right to exercise this option.
               (b) Except to the extent the sale and remittance procedure is utilized in connection with the option exercise, payment of the Exercise Price must accompany the Notice of Exercise or other notification process (or the Purchase Agreement, if applicable) delivered to the Corporation in connection with the option exercise.
               (c) As soon after the Exercise Date as practical, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of Optionee (or any other person or persons exercising this option) a certificate for the purchased Option Shares, with the appropriate legends affixed thereto. To the extent any such Option Shares are unvested, the certificates for those Option Shares shall be endorsed with an appropriate legend evidencing the Corporation's repurchase rights and may be held in escrow with the Corporation until such shares vest.
               (d) In no event may this option be exercised for any fractional shares.
          11. . This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise make changes in its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets. In addition, this Agreement shall not in any way be construed or interpreted so as to affect adversely or otherwise impair the right of the Corporation or the stockholders to remove Optionee from the Board at any time in accordance with the provisions of applicable law.
No Impairment of Rights

exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such exercise and issuance.
               (b) The inability of the Corporation to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Corporation to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this option shall relieve the Corporation of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Corporation, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals.
          13. .

RECITALS
          A. The Board has adopted the Plan for the purpose of retaining the services of selected Employees and consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary).
          B. Participant is to render valuable services to the Corporation (or a Parent or Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Corporation's issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Participant under the Stock Issuance Program.
          C. All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix A.
, it is hereby agreed as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
          1. . The Corporation hereby awards to the Participant, as of the Award Date, Restricted Stock Units under the Plan. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock on the vesting date of that unit. The number of shares of Common Stock subject to the awarded Restricted Stock Units, the applicable vesting schedule for those shares, the dates on which those vested shares shall become issuable to Participant and the remaining terms and conditions governing the award (the "Award") shall be as set forth in this Agreement.
Grant of Restricted Stock Units
          2. . Prior to actual receipt of the Shares which vest hereunder, the Participant may not transfer any interest in the Award or the underlying Shares. Any Shares which vest hereunder but which otherwise remain unissued at the time of the
Limited Transferability
 
Participant's death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of the Participant's will or the laws of inheritance or to the Participant's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this Award. The Participant may also direct the Corporation to issue the stock certificates for any Shares which in fact vest and become issuable under the Award during his or her lifetime to one or more designated family members or a trust established for the Participant and/or his or her family members. The Participant may make such a beneficiary designation or certificate directive at any time by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator or its designee.
          3. . Should the Participant cease Service for any reason prior to vesting in one or more Shares subject to this Award, then the Award will be immediately cancelled with respect to those unvested Shares, and the number of Restricted Stock Units will be reduced accordingly. The Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled units.
Cessation of Service
          4. 
Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents
               (a) The holder of this Award shall not have any stockholder rights, including voting or dividend rights, with respect to the Shares subject to the Award until the Participant becomes the record holder of those Shares following their actual issuance upon the Corporation's collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes.
               (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any dividend or other distribution payable other than in shares of Common Stock, whether regular or extraordinary, be declared and paid on the outstanding Common Stock while one or more Shares remain subject to this Award (i.e., those Shares are not otherwise issued and outstanding for purposes of entitlement to the dividend or distribution), then a special book account shall be established for the Participant and credited with a phantom dividend equivalent to the actual dividend or distribution which would have been paid on those Shares had they been issued and outstanding and entitled to that dividend or distribution. As the Shares subsequently vest hereunder, the phantom dividend equivalents credited to those Shares in the book account shall be distributed to the Participant (in cash or such other form as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in its sole discretion) concurrently with the issuance of the vested Shares to which those phantom dividend equivalents relate. However, each such distribution shall be subject to the Corporation's collection of the Withholding Taxes applicable to that distribution.
          5. .
Change of Control
               (a) Any Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award at the time of a Change in Control may be assumed by the successor entity or otherwise continued in full force and effect or may be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor entity which preserves the Fair Market Value of the unvested shares of Common Stock subject to the Award at the time of the Change in Control and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to the Award. In the event of such assumption or continuation of the Award or such replacement of the Award with a cash incentive program, no accelerated vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall occur at the time of the Change in Control.
 
               (b) In the event the Award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect, the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award shall be adjusted immediately after the consummation of the Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which the Shares subject to those units immediately prior to the Change in Control would have been converted in consummation of that Change in Control had those Shares actually been issued and outstanding at that time. To the extent the actual holders of the outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation (or parent entity) may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award at that time, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in the Change in Control transaction, provided such common stock is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities exchange or market.
               (c) If the Restricted Stock Units subject to this Award at the time of the Change in Control are not assumed or otherwise continued in effect or replaced with a cash incentive program in accordance with Paragraph 5(a), then those units will vest immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control. The Shares subject to those vested units will be issued immediately upon such vesting (or otherwise converted into the right to receive the same consideration per share of Common Stock payable to the other stockholders of the Corporation in consummation of that Change in Control), subject to the Corporation's collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7.
               (d) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
          6. . Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder.
Adjustment in Shares
          7. .
Issuance of Shares of Common Stock
               (a) As soon as administratively practicable following each date one or more Shares vest in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of the Participant a certificate (which may be in electronic form) for the shares of Common Stock which vest on that date under the Award and shall concurrently distribute to the Participant any phantom dividend equivalents with respect to those Shares, subject in each instance to the Corporation's collection of the applicable Withholding Taxes. The Withholding Taxes may be collected from the Participant through any of the following alternatives:
 
           the Participant's delivery of his or her separate check payable to the Corporation in the amount of such Withholding Taxes, or
-
           the use of the proceeds from a next-day sale of the Shares issued to the Participant, provided and only if (i) such a sale is permissible under the Corporation's trading policies governing the sale of Common Stock, (ii) the Participant makes an irrevocable commitment, on or before the vesting date for those Shares, to effect such sale of the Shares and (iii) the transaction is not otherwise deemed to constitute a prohibited loan under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or
-
           with respect to the distributed phantom dividend equivalents, the Corporation's withholding a portion of that distribution, with the cash portion to be the first portion so withheld.
-
               (b) The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion and pursuant to procedures authorized and established by the Plan Administrator for such purpose, permit the Participant to satisfy the Withholding Tax liability applicable to the Shares which vest under the Award by allowing the Participant to direct the Corporation to withhold a portion of those vested Shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the vesting date) equal to the amount of such Withholding Taxes; , that the amount of any Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Corporations required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. Participant shall be notified in writing in the event such Share withholding mechanism is actually to be made available from time to time with respect to one or more Shares which vest under this Agreement.
provided, however
               (c) Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph 5 or this Paragraph 7, the settlement of all Restricted Stock Units which vest under the Award shall be made solely in shares of Common Stock. In no event, however, shall any fractional shares be issued. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Common Stock to be issued at the time the Award vests shall, to the extent necessary, be rounded down to the next whole share in order to avoid the issuance of a fractional share.
 
          8. . The issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Award shall be subject to compliance by the Corporation and Participant with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such issuance.
Compliance with Laws and Regulations
          9. . Any notice required to be given or delivered to the Corporation under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Corporation at its principal corporate offices. Any notice required to be given or delivered to Participant shall be in writing and addressed to Participant at the address indicated below Participant's signature line on this Agreement.

Construction
          12. . The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without resort to that State's conflict-of-laws rules.
Governing Law
          13. . Nothing in this Agreement or in the Plan shall confer upon Participant any right to continue in Service for any period of specific duration or interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining Participant) or of Participant, which rights are hereby expressly reserved by each, to terminate Participant's Service at any time for any reason, with or without cause.

, it is hereby agreed as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
          1. . Participant is hereby awarded, as of the Award Date, Restricted Stock Units under the Automatic Grant Program.

Grant of Restricted Stock Units

Any Shares which vest hereunder but which otherwise remain unissued at the time of the Participant's death may be transferred pursuant to the provisions of the Participant's will or the laws of inheritance or to the Participant's designated beneficiary or beneficiaries of this Award. The Participant may also direct the Corporation to issue the stock certificates for any Shares which in fact vest and become issuable under the Award during his or her lifetime to one or more designated family members or a trust established for the Participant and/or his or her family members. The Participant may make such a beneficiary designation or certificate directive at any time by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator or its designee.

The Participant shall thereupon cease to have any right or entitlement to receive any Shares under those cancelled units.
Cessation of Service
          4.
Stockholder Rights and Dividend Equivalents
               (a) The holder of this Award shall not have any stockholder rights, including voting or dividend rights, with respect to the Shares subject to the Award until the Participant becomes the record holder of those Shares following their actual issuance.
               (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, should any dividend or other distribution payable other than in shares of Common Stock, whether regular or extraordinary, be declared and paid on the outstanding Common Stock while one or more Shares remain subject to this Award (i.e., those Shares are not otherwise issued and outstanding for purposes of entitlement to the dividend or distribution), then a special book account shall be established for the Participant and credited with a phantom dividend equivalent to the actual dividend or distribution which would have been paid on those Shares had they been issued and outstanding and entitled to that dividend or distribution. As the Shares subsequently vest hereunder, the phantom dividend equivalents credited to those Shares in the book account shall be distributed to the Participant (in cash or such other form as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in its sole discretion) concurrently with the issuance of the vested Shares to which those phantom dividend equivalents relate.

               (b) Should Participant cease Service by reason of death or Permanent Disability, then the Restricted Stock Units at the time subject to this Award will vest immediately, and the Shares subject to those vested units will be issued as soon as administratively practicable following such cessation of Service.
               (c) This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
          6. . Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the total number and/or class of securities issuable pursuant to this Award in order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of benefits hereunder.
Adjustment in Shares
          7. . As soon as administratively practicable following each date one or more Shares vest in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Corporation shall issue to or on behalf of the Participant a certificate (which may be in electronic form) for the shares of Common Stock which vest on that date under the Award and shall concurrently distribute to the Participant any phantom dividend equivalents with respect to those Shares.

Exhibit 99.1
SUNNYVALE, CA, July 21, 2005  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended July 3, 2005. Second quarter revenues increased 19% on a year-over-year basis to $515 million and increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2005. Second quarter net income, which included $27 million from our portion of Fab 3 development costs, was $70.5 million compared to $70.6 million in the second quarter of 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share were $0.37, compared with $0.38 in the second quarter of 2004.
"We are very pleased with our second quarter results," said Eli Harari, SanDisk CEO. "SanDisk gained U.S. retail market share, and demand for high capacity cards grew at a surprisingly fast pace to an average retail card capacity of 496 megabytes. Demand for 1 gigabyte and higher capacity cards has been strong for the gaming market and our premium Ultra and Extreme lines. OEM bookings are robust, primarily from handset manufacturers that are bundling high capacity cards with new handsets that support music, video and higher megapixel cameras. We believe this trend may be a positive precursor for the long awaited handset card market acceleration in 2006. During the second quarter, we made steady progress towards qualifying our new 70-nanometer 8 gigabit NAND/MLC chip. We expect to complete internal qualification and start production of this highly cost-effective chip in the third quarter and reach volume output in the fourth quarter  in time for the anticipated increase in demand for high capacity cards for year-end holiday sales. We firmly believe that our 2005 investments in advanced technology and in large-scale 300 millimeter NAND/MLC fab capacity, coupled with our valuable IP assets and our strong balance sheet, position SanDisk well for 2006."

Exhibit 99.1
SUNNYVALE, CA, October 20, 2005  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the third quarter ended October 2, 2005. Third quarter revenues increased 45% on a year-over-year basis to a record $590 million and increased 15% compared to the second quarter of 2005. Third quarter net income was $107.5 million compared to $54.1 million in the third quarter of 2004 and $70.5 million in the second quarter of 2005. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.55, up 90% on a year-over-year basis and up 49% compared to the second quarter of 2005.
"We are very pleased with the outstanding results for our third quarter. Demand was strong throughout the quarter in our served markets. We are particularly encouraged by the excellent adoption of our cards in music-enabled mobile phones that require high capacity cards," said Eli Harari, SanDisk CEO. "Demand for NAND flash continues to grow globally and is currently outstripping industry-wide supply, particularly for high density NAND. Towards the end of the quarter we began first shipments of cards employing our cost effective 70-nanometer 8 gigabit NAND/MLC chip. Together with Toshiba we are accelerating the production ramp at Flash Partners' 300 millimeter fab to meet the anticipated strong demand for NAND flash in the fourth quarter and in 2006. We are optimistic about our business in the traditionally strong fourth quarter."

Conference Call
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business outlook in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2006, production schedules, market growth rates, market supply and demand, and scheduled appearances by our CEO and CFO that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: slower than expected growth in market demand for our products or a slower adoption rate for these products in current and new markets that we are targeting, any interruption of or delay in supply from any of the semiconductor manufacturing or subcontracting facilities, including test and assembly facilities that supply products to us, the fact that no security technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, slower than expected expansion of our global sales channels, fluctuations in operating results, unexpected yield variances and longer than expected low yields and other possible delays related to our conversion to 70-nanometer NAND flash technology or the ramp-up of the new 300-millimeter flash fabrication facility, unexpected delays in the ramp-up of volume production of our new 70-nanometer 8 gigabit NAND/MLC chip, our inability to make additional planned smaller geometry conversions in a timely manner, future average selling price erosion that may be more severe than our expectations due to decreased demand or possible excess industry capacity of flash memory from ourselves as well as from existing suppliers or from new competitors that are planning to aggressively increase supply in the fourth quarter of 2005 or 2006, price increases from non-captive flash memory sources and third-party subcontractors, higher than expected operating expenses, higher than anticipated capital equipment expenditures, adverse global economic and geo-political conditions, including adverse currency exchange rates and acts of terror, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products that are based on 70-nanometer NAND technology, fluctuations in license and royalty revenues, business interruption due to earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics or other natural disasters, particularly in areas in the Pacific Rim and Japan where we manufacture and assemble products, potential impact of high energy prices and other global events outside of our control which could adversely impact consumer confidence and hence reduce demand for our products, scheduled appearances by our executives could be cancelled or delayed by us or the network, and the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, the Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2005 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Exhibit 99.1
     MARIA BARTIROMO, host:
     Welcome back. SanDisk out with news of an acquisition right now, as well as 3rd quarter earnings. The chipmaker's net income shot up to $107.5 million; record high revenue of $590 million. Also this hour SanDisk announcing the acquisition of Matrix, a privately held memory chipmaker.
     The stock is rising in the extended hours tonight: up 11 percent. As we speak, just popped, a few moments ago when the company released the news up $5 to $52.82.
     SanDisk Founder and CEO, Eli Harari joins me in a First on CNBC interview, ahead of the company Conference Call at 5:00 eastern. Dr. Harari, nice to have you with us.
     Dr. ELI HARARI (CEO, SanDisk): Hi, Maria.
     BARTIROMO: Earnings up 90 percent, and revenue up 45 percent. What can you tell us about the quarter? What is behind this growth?
     Mr. HARARI: Outstanding quarter, very strong growth across five major markets. The handset market particularly, we sold over 5 million cards into that market that. That market did not exist a year ago, and its really growingreally taking off. (Graph of SanDisk net income bar graph)
     BARTIROMO: You are about to have a conference call with analysts. What is the most important message you want to get out to those analysts?
     Mr. HARARI: The 4th quarter is gonna be very good; very strong demand, supply constraint and a very good 2006. And we're really thrilled about the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor today.
     BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about Matrix in a minute. We talk a lot here about the impact oil prices have had on the consumer. (Graph of SanDisk three year line
 
graph) We're going into the 4th quarter, and you're saying that you're going to see a good 4th quarter. Do you worry that some of the consumer electronics out therethat, of course, your very chips go intomight see a slowdown because of the pressure that people are facing with the price of oil?
     Mr. HARARI: Our markets are global, so we really have more than 50 percent of our sales outside of the United States. We, of course, are concerned like everybody else about impact later, you know, Christmas season but, from our visibility today, it's looking very good for the 4 quarter. (Graph of SanDisk vs Peers, percentage change in 6 months line graph)
th
     BARTIROMO: What does the matrix technology do for your company? The stock is already up 95 percent over the last six months, sir. What does matrix give you?
     Mr. HARARI: Matrix is a strategic investment by our company. They have developed a revolutionary technology to basicallybasically manufacture memory in three dimensions. It's like stackingit's basically like a skyscraper, rather than a single story house. That technology has, we believe great future.
     BARTIROMO: And of course we're seeing a number of new developments, as far as consumer electronics: the Apple coming out with video iPod, you've got a number of new video phones and doing so many things in the wireless revolution. (Visual SanDisk chip) Do you need a different chipa more upgraded chip? Are you going to need new upgraded technology in order to keep pace with what's happening in your industry?
     Mr. HARARI: Yes, it just so happens we've got this chip we're just starting production with an eight gigabit flash chip; it's the industry leading chip. It is one gigabyte on one chip. We can stack four of those to get you a four-gigabyte basically in one package. And we think that that (sic) chip is going to do very, very well for us next year.
     BARTIROMO: Having said that the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates, sir. And a lot of people now say that maybe there is a voice inside the Fed saying maybe 50 basis points next time. You've got higher oil prices and, higher interest rates.

     Mr. HARARI: 2006, we think is going to be a very strong growth year for our products acrosscertainly, handsets, gaming applications. Consumers are spending, you know, at a $50 to $200 range. There's actually quite a lot of disposable income, and it's a global market. The China marketEurope is really developing. So we are very bullish about 2006.

Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities
On October 20, 2005, SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("SanDisk"), Mike Acquisition Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SanDisk ("Mike"), Matrix Semiconductor Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Matrix"), and certain other parties, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement") providing for the merger of Matrix with and into Mike (the "Merger"). The Merger is expected to close before the end of 2005, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, including obtaining the approval of Matrix's stockholders as well as applicable regulatory approvals.
In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, SanDisk has agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Matrix and to assume Matrix's outstanding options and other equity compensation awards in exchange for approximately $12 million in cash and a number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001, of SanDisk (the "SanDisk Common Stock") equal to approximately $238 million divided by the average closing price of the SanDisk Common Stock over five consecutive trading days leading up to the closing of the Merger. The Merger Agreement also contains a so-called collar, which limits the number of shares of SanDisk Common Stock issuable in the Merger if there is a dramatic increase or decrease in the price of shares of SanDisk Common Stock.
The shares of common stock to be issued by SanDisk in the Merger are expected to be issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, for the issuance and exchange of securities approved, after a public hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions of the exchange by a state commission authorized by law to grant such approval. SanDisk intends to apply for such a public fairness hearing before the Commissioner of the California Department of Corporations, in accordance with Section 25142 of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968. If such approval is obtained, the shares issued in the Merger will be freely tradable, subject to certain restrictions set forth in Rule 145 of the Securities Act of 1933. The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that SanDisk will seek to register the shares of common stock to be issued in the

Exhibit 99.1
SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA, October 20, 2005, SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. today announced that they signed a definitive agreement for SanDisk to acquire Matrix. Matrix is a privately held company based in Santa Clara, California that has been developing and supplying 3-D integrated circuit (three dimensional) one-time programmable (OTP) technology since its inception in 1998. Matrix 3-D Memory is used for storage applications that do not require multiple rewrites and where low cost is the paramount consideration, such as video games, music and other content, or for archiving.
The Matrix technology can achieve low cost by building multiple layers of memory arrays on a standard silicon substrate so that active circuitry is not confined to the silicon surface but extends vertically as well. Because OTP technology is not rewritable once programmed, it complements rather than directly competes with Flash memory, which is rewritable but more costly. Matrix has over 100 U.S. issued patents in 3-D integrated circuit technology. SanDisk intends to support and sell Matrix's 3D OTP products through its various sales channels and will work closely with Matrix's customers to assure continuity of supply during the transition.
"We have high regard for the Matrix team and welcome them to SanDisk. Use of the Matrix 3-D Memory extends beyond video games and hopefully will play an important role in content distribution such as incorporation in our recently launched Gruvi cards for secure distribution of premium music titles and other preloaded content in handsets," said Eli Harari, Chief Executive Officer of SanDisk.
"The Matrix team is excited about joining SanDisk and fulfilling our vision of 3-D memory technology," said Dennis Segers, President of Matrix Semiconductor. "Joining SanDisk will provide us with financial, manufacturing, marketing and sales channel resources to help establish Matrix 3DM as a mainstream storage technology for a broad range of consumer applications."
The acquisition consideration will be approximately $250 million, consisting of approximately $238 million of newly issued SanDisk shares and equity incentives and approximately $12 million of cash. The closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory
 
approval and the satisfaction of standard conditions. The parties expect to complete the acquisition by the end of 2005.
Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains forward-looking statements about expectations of achieving commercialization of 3-D Memory, expectations of future revenues from and applications for 3-D Memory, expectations regarding the acquisition's dilutive effect on SanDisk's 2006 earnings per share and expectations concerning the successful integration and continuation of Matrix's business and operations. There are numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause the forward-looking statements in this news release to be inaccurate and that may significantly and adversely affect the combined company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: the combined company's failure to successfully commercialize 3-D Memory or to achieve future revenue from 3-D Memory applications, loss of key customers, loss of key employees, loss in value or use of any material portion of Matrix's patent portfolio, higher than expected operating expenses, unanticipated costs of integration, the risk that the acquisition is not consummated due to the failure to obtain regulatory approval or the failure to satisfy one or more conditions precedent, diversion of management attention from its core business, and other risks detailed from time-to-time in SanDisk's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, its Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2005 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. The companies do not intend to update the information contained in this release.

On December 16, 2005, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement") with IBJ Leasing Co., Ltd. ("IBJ"), Sumisho Lease Co., Ltd. ("Sumisho") and Toshiba Finance Corporation (together with IBJ and Sumisho, the "Lessors"). Under this Guarantee Agreement, SanDisk will guarantee 50% of the payment obligations of Flash Partners Yuken Kaisha ("Flash Partners"), SanDisk's 49.9%-owned flash memory manufacturing company formed with Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba"), to the Lessors under a Basic Lease Contract for lease of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to be installed in Fab 3 at Toshiba's Yokkaichi operations (the "Basic Lease Contract") dated as of December 16, 2005 among Flash Partners (the "Lessee") and the Lessors. Toshiba has entered into a similar guarantee agreement with IBJ and Sumisho, as to which SanDisk has no additional guarantee obligations. SanDisk's guarantee obligation represents 50% of Flash Partners' 35 billion obligation to the Lessors under the Basic Lease Contract.
Under the Basic Lease Contract, Flash Partners will lease flash memory manufacturing equipment from the Lessors for a period of four or five years, as specified in each drawdown under the Basic Lease Contract, and is obligated to make quarterly lease payments. The Basic Lease Contract also provides Flash Partners with an option to purchase the leased equipment at fair market value at the time of purchase.
If Flash Partners defaults on any of its financial obligations under the Basic Lease Contract guaranteed by SanDisk, the Lessors may demand that SanDisk perform such obligations within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of the demand, so long as the Lessors have first provided Flash Partners with 10 business days to cure such default.
Additionally, the Lessors may terminate the Basic Lease Contract and accelerate all of Flash Partners' obligations under the Basic Lease Contract upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Flash Partners' failure to make payments under the Basic Lease Contract or related agreements, and the applicable payments are not made within two banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (2) Flash Partners' failure to obtain and maintain required insurance over the leased equipment; (3) Flash Partners' failure to release encumbrances over the leased equipment; (4) Flash Partners' breach of any provision of any related agreement, which breach is not cured within 10 banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (5) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba is subject to compulsory execution, petition for auction or disposition for failure to pay taxes and public dues, or a petition for bankruptcy, civil rehabilitation, corporate consolidation, corporate reorganization or other similar procedures (including a petition for a similar procedure or disposition under foreign law) unless the petition or procedure is cancelled or dissolved within 30 calendar days; (6) Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk discontinues all or a material part of its business, or adopts a resolution of dissolution without the approval of the Lessors; (7) Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk assigns all or a material part of its business without the consent of the Lessors; (8) Flash Partners,

Toshiba or SanDisk suspends payment, or any clearing bank undertakes procedures for suspension of transactions by Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk with banks and similar institutions; (9) there is a change in the interest ratio in Flash Partners directly or indirectly invested by each of Toshiba and SanDisk without the agreement of the Lessors; (10) the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004 among Toshiba, SanDisk and SanDisk International Limited is cancelled, dissolved or terminated; (11) any monetary obligation of Flash Partners, Toshiba or SanDisk in excess of $20.0 million has become immediately due and payable, other than obligations in which the third-party creditor has explicitly or implicitly agreed or consented to the delinquency, including situations where industry custom provides that silence is deemed consent; (12) the total amount of equity on SanDisk's consolidated balance sheet as of any fiscal year end or the mid point of a fiscal year is less than $1.164 billion; (13) if the long-term loan rating of SanDisk by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Moody's Investors Service is decreased to below BB- or Ba3 respectively; or (14) any other significant change with respect to the assets of Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba that affect payments under the Basic Lease Contract (excluding changes that can be resolved within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice from the Lessors).
Upon the occurrence of any of these events, the Lessors may, at their option, terminate the Basic Lease Contract effective immediately upon written notice to Flash Partners, and the Lessors may demand that SanDisk perform its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of such demand.
Upon any such default or termination, SanDisk will be jointly and severally liable with Flash Partners to the Lessors to the extent of the guarantee, without any obligation on the part of the Lessors to first exhaust any remedies it may have against Flash Partners.
The foregoing summaries of the material terms of the Guarantee Agreement and the terms of the Basic Lease Agreement that are material with respect to SanDisk's obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Guarantee Agreement and the Basic Lease Agreement, each of which will be filed as exhibits to the SanDisk's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 1, 2006.

represented by such Certificate shall have been converted in accordance with Section 1.4 (less any shares of SanDisk Common Stock deposited into the Escrow Fund) as set forth on the Spreadsheet (as defined in Section 4.14), and the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled.

If a transfer of ownership of shares of Matrix Capital Stock has not been registered in Matrix's transfer records, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other Tax (as defined in Section 2.9(a)) required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of SanDisk that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

To
 
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Matrix Capital Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent.

No fraction of a share of SanDisk Common Stock will be issued in connection with the Merger, and in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Matrix Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of SanDisk Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of SanDisk Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from SanDisk an amount of cash equal to such fraction of a share multiplied by the SanDisk Closing Price.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
SUNNYVALE, CA, January 26, 2006  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended January 1, 2006. Fourth quarter revenues increased 37% on a year-over-year basis to a record $751 million and increased 27% compared to the third quarter of 2005. Fourth quarter net income was $134 million compared to $78 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $107 million in the third quarter of 2005. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up 62% on a year-over-year basis and up 24% compared to the third quarter of 2005.
Total revenue for fiscal 2005 was $2.3 billion, up 30% from $1.8 billion in 2004. Product revenues were $2.1 billion, up 29% from $1.6 billion in 2004. License and royalty revenues were $239 million, up 37% from $174 million in 2004. Net income was $386 million, up 45% from net income of $267 million in 2004. Fully diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2005 was $2.00, compared to $1.44 in 2004.
"The fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year for SanDisk. We sold approximately 11 million mobile cards primarily into OEM bundles in camera-phones and musiccentric phones, and we are seeing exceptionally broad acceptance of our microSD format in new handsets from the top tier OEMs. We sold more than a million Flash MP3 players in the fourth quarter, gaining a clear number two share in the highly competitive U.S. retail market, indicative of the growing recognition among consumers of the SanDisk brand, and driven by our strong retail sales organization, which surpassed the 150,000 storefront milestone during the quarter," said Eli Harari, SanDisk CEO.
TM
"We are optimistic about our business outlook and our competitiveness in 2006 and expect this to be a year of continuing strong growth in demand in our target markets as well as a competitive landscape that is characteristic of rapidly growing consumer massmarkets. We expect a seasonally soft first quarter in retail partially offset by continuing strength in our OEM handset business. To stimulate demand and accelerate consumers' move to gigabyte capacities in 2006, we are taking significant pricing actions in the first quarter that are made possible for us through the significantly lower costs achieved as we ramp production at the Flash Partners' Fab 3 and as we continue to increase output of our 8 gigabit chip."

Conference Call
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business outlook for the first quarter and fiscal year 2006, market supply and demand, expected continued strength in the handset market and continued intense competition in our markets, and scheduled appearances by our CEO and CFO that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: slower than expected growth in market demand for our products or a slower adoption rate for these products in current and new markets that we are targeting, any interruption of or delay in supply from any of the semiconductor manufacturing or subcontracting facilities, including test and assembly facilities that supply products to us, decreased availability of test and assembly capacity and increased prices for such services, slower than expected expansion of our global sales channels, fluctuations in operating results, unexpected yield variances and longer than expected low yields and other possible delays related to our conversion to 70-nanometer NAND flash technology or the ramp-up of the 300-millimeter flash fabrication facility, unexpected delays in the ramp-up of volume production of our new 70-nanometer 8 gigabit NAND/MLC chip, our inability to make additional planned smaller geometry conversions in a timely manner, future average selling price erosion that may be more severe than our expectations due to decreased demand or possible excess industry capacity of flash memory from ourselves as well as from existing suppliers or from new competitors that are planning to aggressively increase supply in 2006, price increases from non-captive flash memory sources and third-party subcontractors, higher than expected operating expenses, higher than anticipated capital equipment expenditures, adverse global economic and geo-political conditions, including adverse currency exchange rates and acts of terror, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new products that are based on 70-nanometer NAND technology, fluctuations in license and royalty revenues, business interruption due to earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics or other natural disasters, particularly in areas in the Pacific
Forward-Looking Statements
 
Rim and Japan where we manufacture and assemble products, potential impact of high energy prices and other global events outside of our control which could adversely impact consumer confidence and hence reduce demand for our products, scheduled appearances by our executives could be cancelled or delayed by us or the network, and the other risks detailed from time-to-time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, the Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2005 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We do not intend to update the information contained in this release.
SanDisk is the original inventor of flash storage cards and is the world's largest supplier of flash data storage card products using its patented, high-density flash memory and controller technology.

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") had previously reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2004 that on September 10, 2004, SanDisk and Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba") created Flash Partners, Ltd., a Japanese yugen kaisha, owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba, and agreed to cooperate in the construction and equipping of a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, Fab 3, in Yokkaichi, Japan to produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. The agreements governing the venture, including the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004, were filed with SanDisk's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004.
The total investment in Fab 3, excluding the cost of building construction, was estimated at $2.5 billion through the end of 2006, of which SanDisk's share was estimated to be approximately $1.25 billion. This investment was expected to generate approximately 37,500 wafers per month (subsequently expanded to 48,750 wafers per month), of which SanDisk's allocation is 50%.
On February 8, 2006, SanDisk and Toshiba agreed to accelerate the expansion of Fab 3, which is expected to bring Fab 3 wafer capacity from the previously planned 48,750 wafers per month to 70,000 wafers per month by March 2007. The incremental investment by SanDisk for 50% of this higher Fab 3 output is currently estimated at approximately $500 million over the next 12 months. SanDisk's total 2006 investment in Fab 3 is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion, with its total investment to bring Fab 3 wafer capacity to 70,000 wafers per month expected to be approximately $1.6 billion. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
Section 4.
                      Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute or by the certificate of incorporation, may be called by the chief executive officer or the chairman and shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning at least a majority of the entire capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote.

Section 5.
 
                      Written notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of the General corporation Law of Delaware.
Section 10.
                     Provided the candidate's name has been placed in nomination prior to the voting and one or more stockholders has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the stockholder's intent to cumulate the stockholder's votes, every stockholder entitled to vote at any election for directors shall have the right to cumulate such stockholder's votes and give one candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of votes to which the stockholder's shares are normally entitled, or distribute the stockholder's votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the stockholder shall think fit. The candidates receiving the highest number of votes of the shares entitled to be voted for them up to the number of directors to be elected by such shares are elected.
Section 11.
                     Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Section 12.
                     At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting, business must be:
Section 13.
(a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors;
 
(b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of a majority of the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies (the "Whole Board"); or
(c) otherwise properly be requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder.
For business to be properly requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than eighty (80) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the meeting is not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders.

(e) such other information regarding each matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, by the Board of Directors, and
(f) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12 of the bylaws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12 of the bylaws, and if he/she should so determine, he/she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 12.
                     Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally. However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 80 days in advance of such meeting; provided however, that in the event that the date of the meeting was not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than 90 days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders. Each such notice shall set forth:
Section 14.
(a) The name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated;
 
(b) A representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice;
(c) A description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder;
(d) Such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and
(e) The consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected.
                      The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be eight (8). Each director shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, and shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
Section 1.
                      Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except that in the event a director is removed by the stockholders for cause, the stockholders shall be entitled to fill the vacancy created as a result of such removal. The directors so chosen shall serve for the remainder of the term of the vacated directorships being filled and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.
Section 2.
                      The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.
                      The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.
Section 4.
                      The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected Board of Directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
Section 5.
                      Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
Section 6.
                      Special meetings of the board may be called by the chief executive officer, chairman or vice-chairman on five (5) days' notice to each director by mail or twenty-four (24) hours notice to each director either personally or by telephone, telegram or facsimile; special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the board consists of only one director, in which case special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of the sole director. A written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time of the meeting stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Section 7.
 
                      At all meetings of the board a majority of the then existing directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation.

Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

Reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he/she is or was a director or officer of the corporation (or was serving at the corporation's request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of a statement from such director or officer requesting such advance and an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he/she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized by relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
Section 6.
The corporation shall have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (in addition to directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, or (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.
A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction
 
from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is hereafter amended to authorize, with the approval of a corporation's stockholders, further reductions in the liability of the corporation's directors for breach of fiduciary duty, then a director of the corporation shall not be liable for any such breach to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII, Section 6 by the stockholders of the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him/her and incurred by him/her in any such capacity, or arising out of his/her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him/her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
The foregoing rights of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled apart from the provisions of this Article VII.
                      The chairman of the board, the president, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, or any other person authorized by the Board of Directors is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority granted herein may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
Section 7.
                      These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, when such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the certificate of incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws be contained in the notice of such special meeting. If the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the certificate of incorporation, it shall not divest or limit the power of the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On April 20, 2006, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its first quarter ended April 2, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
     In addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for stock compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor in January 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
     SUNNYVALE, CA, April 20, 2006  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the first quarter ended April 2, 2006. Total first quarter revenues increased 38% on a year-over-year basis to $623 million. First quarter net income as reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $35 million, or $0.17 per fully diluted share. First quarter 2006 GAAP results reflect the impact of implementing SFAS 123(R) and the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006.
     Excluding the impact of amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, the write-off of acquired in-process technology, stock compensation expense and the related tax effect, first quarter non-GAAP net income was $90 million, or $0.44 per fully diluted share, which compares to the first quarter 2005 GAAP results of $75 million, or $0.39 per fully diluted share.
     "First quarter revenues were, as expected, seasonally soft in U.S. retail. We believe that the pricing actions we implemented in the quarter are beginning to have the intended effect of shifting consumer preferences to 1 and 2 gigabyte capacities, where we are strongest. Sales of our mobile cards for handsets continued to be strong and accounted for 30% of first quarter product revenues, up from 7% in the corresponding quarter one year ago. Pricing overall was under pressure as NAND components supply exceeded demand due primarily to weaker than expected sales of Flash audio players following a phenomenally strong fourth quarter," said Eli Harari, president and chief executive officer of SanDisk Corporation. "For the second quarter we plan on somewhat more moderate pricing actions designed to further accelerate consumption of higher capacity cards and to stoke demand from new markets helping to restore industry wide balance between demand and supply in the second half of 2006. We expect our mobile card revenues to continue strong in the second quarter, and we expect second quarter retail revenues to improve moderately due to price elasticity, favorable seasonality and new products that we expect to ship in volume in the second quarter, such as our exciting Sansa  e200 audio player. Product gross margins are expected to improve into the second half as we continue to ramp our highly cost-effective captive production at fab 3 while temporarily flexing down our non-captive purchases."

(*) To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses we recorded for stock compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor in January 2006, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in our financial reporting. Further, these non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing our performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
(a) Equity based compensation expense. (b) Write-off of acquired in-process technology associated with the Matrix acquisition. (January 2006) (c) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, primarily core and developed technology related to the acquisition of Matrix. (d) Income taxes associated with certain non-GAAP adjustments. (e) Adjustment of diluted share count for the impact of applying SFAS 123.

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") had previously reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2004 that on September 10, 2004, SanDisk and Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba") created Flash Partners, Ltd., a Japanese yugen kaisha, owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba, and agreed to cooperate in the construction and equipping of a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, Fab 3, in Yokkaichi, Japan to produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. The agreements governing the venture, including the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004, were filed with SanDisk's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004.
The total investment in Fab 3, excluding the cost of building construction, was estimated at $2.5 billion through the end of 2006, of which SanDisk's share was estimated to be approximately $1.25 billion. This investment was expected to generate approximately 37,500 wafers per month (subsequently expanded to 48,750 wafers per month), of which SanDisk's allocation is 50%.
On February 14, 2006, SanDisk reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K that SanDisk and Toshiba had agreed on February 8, 2006 to accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 by increasing capacity from 48,750 wafers per month to 70,000 wafers per month by March 2007. The increase in wafer production was estimated to increase SanDisk's 50% investment in Fab 3 in the next 12 months by approximately $500 million, bringing SanDisk's total investment to approximately $1.6 billion.
On April 28, 2006, SanDisk and Toshiba agreed to further accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 to increase Fab 3 wafer capacity from 70,000 wafers per month to 90,000 wafers per month by April 2007. The incremental investment by SanDisk for 50% of this higher Fab 3 output is currently estimated at approximately $300 million over the next 12 months. SanDisk's total investment to bring Fab 3 wafer capacity to 90,000 wafers per month is expected to be approximately $1.9 billion. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.

8. Indemnity and Contribution
 
necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any issuer free writing prospectus used by the Underwriters in violation of Section 7 hereof.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them.

The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein (other than with respect to Section 8(a) in cases in which Section 8(b) is applicable), then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
pro rata
 
considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
9. Termination

If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate number of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.

          Section 5.01.   . The following events shall be Events of Default with respect to the Notes:
Events of Default
     (a) default in any payment of interest, on any Note when due and payable and the default continues for a period of 30 days;
     (b) default in the payment of principal of any Note when due and payable on the Maturity Date, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
     (c) failure by the Company to comply with its obligation to convert the Notes into cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock, as applicable, upon exercise of a holder's conversion right;
     (d) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Article X;
     (e) failure by the Company to issue a Designated Event Company Notice in accordance with Section 14.02 when due;
 
     (f) failure by the Company for 60 days to comply with any of its other agreements (other than a covenant or warranty or default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically provided for) contained in the Notes or the Indenture after written notice of such default from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding has been received by the Company;
     (g) default by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in the payment of the principal or interest on any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any debt for money borrowed in excess of $50 million in the aggregate of the Company and/or any such Subsidiary, whether such debt now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default results in such debt becoming or being declared due and payable, and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled within 30 days after written notice of such acceleration has been received by the Company or such Subsidiary;
     (h) the Company shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; or
     (i) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.
     In case one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) with respect to the Company), unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Noteholders), may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes contained to the contrary notwithstanding. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) occurs and is continuing with respect to the Company, the principal of all the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest shall be immediately
 
due and payable. This provision, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Notes and the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by the Notes during the period of such Default) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.06, and if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any and all Events of Defaults under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on Notes that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.07, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Notes and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. The Company shall notify the Responsible Officer of the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
     In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
          Section 5.02.   . In the event that the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding hereunder have declared the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes, to be due and payable immediately in accordance with Section 5.01, and the Company shall have failed forthwith to pay such amounts, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, after being furnished suitable indemnity pursuant to Section 6.01, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid (including such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities incurred by the Trustee hereunder other than through its negligence or bad faith), and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final degree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.
Payments of Notes on Default; Suit Therefor
 
     In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes under title 11 of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of the Company or such other obligor, or in the case of any other judicial proceedings relative to the Company or such other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.02, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Noteholders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the Notes, its or their creditors, or its or their property, and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of any amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, custodian or similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Noteholders to make such payments to the Trustee, as administrative expenses, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements, including agents and counsel fees, and including any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.06 hereof, incurred by it up to the date of such distribution. To the extent that such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property which the holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Noteholder or the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding.
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes.
     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee
 
shall be held to represent all the holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of the Notes parties to any such proceedings.
          Section 5.03.   . Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V with respect to the Notes shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:
Application of Monies Collected by Trustee
     First, to the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06;
     Second, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the Notes in default in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto;
     Third, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, and be unpaid to the payment of the whole amount (including, if applicable, payments in respect of the Conversion Obligation and Additional Shares) then owing and unpaid upon the Notes for principal and interest, with interest on the overdue principal (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes, and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Notes, then to the payment of such principal and interest without preference or priority of principal over interest, or of interest over principal or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Note over any other Note, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest; and
     Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or any other Person lawfully entitled thereto.
          Section 5.04.   . No holder of any Note shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator, custodian or other similar official, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and no direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding pursuant to Section 5.07; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Note with every other taker and holder and the
Proceedings by Noteholders
 
Trustee, that no one or more Noteholders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Noteholder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Noteholders (except as otherwise provided herein). For the protection and enforcement of this Section 5.04, each and every Noteholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any provision of any Note, the right of any Noteholder to receive payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Noteholder.
     Anything in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, the holder of any Note, without the consent of either the Trustee or the holder of any other Note, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and maintain any proceeding suitable to enforce, his rights of conversion as provided herein.
          Section 5.05.   . In case of an Event of Default the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by taw.
Proceedings by Trustee
          Section 5.06.   . Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article V to the Trustee or to the Noteholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.04, every power and remedy given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Noteholders.
Remedies Cumulative and Continuing
          Section 5.07.   . The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to Notes; , , that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with
Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of Noteholders
provided
however
 
such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of and accrued and unpaid interest on, or the principal of, the Notes when due which has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.01, (ii) a failure by the Company to deliver cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) upon conversion of the Notes, or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provisions hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.07, said default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 5.08.   . The Trustee shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence and continuance of a Default of which a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge, mail to all Noteholders as the names and addresses of such holders appear upon the Note register, notice of all Defaults known to a Responsible Officer, unless such Defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice; and that, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on any of the Notes, then in any such event the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Noteholders.
Notice of Defaults
provided
     Section 5.09.   . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; that the provisions of this Section 5.09 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, or to any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on any Note on or after the due date expressed in such Note or to any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII.
Undertaking to Pay Costs
provided
 
        Section 6.01.   . The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiver of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs; that if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against loss, liability or expense.
Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee
provided
     No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that
     (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred:
     (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and, after it has been qualified thereunder, the Trust Indenture Act, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act against the Trustee; and
     (ii) in the absence of bad faith and willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
     (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be established by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
     (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and either (i) believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture or (ii) in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined as provided in Section 7.04 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
 
available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture;
     (d) whether or not therein provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section;
     (e) the Trustee shall not be liable in respect of any payment (as to the correctness of amount, entitlement to receive or any other matters relating to payment) or notice effected by the Company or any Paying Agent or any records maintained by any co-registrar with respect to the Notes;
     (f) if any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the fact of which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely on its failure to receive such notice as reason to act as if no such event occurred, unless such Responsible Officer of the Trustee had actual knowledge of such event;
     (g) in the absence of written investment direction from the Company, all cash received by the Trustee shall be placed in a non-interest bearing trust account. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for the selection of investments or for investment losses incurred thereon or for losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of any such investments prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investments prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investment to provide timely written investment direction, and the Trustee shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest any amounts held hereunder in the absence of such written investment direction from the Company; and
     (h) in the event that the Trustee is also acting as Custodian, Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or transfer agent hereunder, the rights and protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article VI shall also be afforded to it in its capacity as such.
     None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.
          Section 6.02.   Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.01:
Reliance on Documents, Opinions, Etc.
     (a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, note, coupon or other paper or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;
     (b) any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the Board of Directors may be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;

account of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, for conversion of such Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Conversion Agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

conveyance, transfer or lease, the person named as the "Company" in the first paragraph of this Indenture or any successor which shall thereafter have become such in the manner prescribed in this Article X may be dissolved, wound up and liquidated at any time thereafter and such person shall be released from its liabilities as obligor and maker of the Notes and from its obligations under this Indenture.
     In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Notes thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
          Section 10.03. .

Conversion Privilege
     (a) Subject to the conditions described in clause (i), (ii), and (iii) below, and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article XIII, a Noteholder shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Note at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding February [___], 2013 at a rate (the "") of [___] shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment by the Company as provided in Section 13.04) per $1,000 principal amount Note (the "") under the circumstances and during the periods set forth below.

Conversion Obligation
     (i) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February [___], 2013, during the five Business Day period immediately after any five consecutive Trading Day period (the "") in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on such date and the Conversion Rate on such date, all as determined by the Trustee. The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes unless requested by the Company to do so in writing, and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Noteholder provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price of the Notes would be less than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price at such time, at which time the Company shall instruct the Trustee to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per Note is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date. If the Trading Price condition set forth above has been met, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders. If, at any time after the Trading Price condition set forth above has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders.
Measurement Period
 
     (ii) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February [___], 2013, during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2006, if the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for twenty (20) or more Trading Days in a period of thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
     (iii) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February [___], 2013 as provided in Section 13.01(b), Section 13.01(c) and Section 13.01(d).
     (b) In the event that the Company elects to:
     (i) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at a price less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution; or
     (ii) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, assets or debt securities of the Company or rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value (as determined by the Board of Directors) exceeding 10% of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day immediately preceding the date of declaration of such distribution,
then, in either case, holders may surrender the Notes for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company provides notice to holders referred to in the next sentence until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. The Company shall notify holders of any distribution referred to in either clause (i) or clause (ii) above and of the resulting conversion right no later than the 20 Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Holders may not exercise this right if such Holder participates in the distribution without conversion.
th
     (c) If the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, then the holders shall have the right to convert Notes at any time beginning fifteen calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date that is fifteen calendar days after the date that is the effective date of such transaction; such transaction does not otherwise constitute a Designated Event to which the provisions of Section 13.01(d) shall apply. The Company will notify holders of Notes at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Day prior to such 15th day.
provided
 
     (d) If the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes a Designated Event, a holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the 30th scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Repurchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in Section 13.01(e); provided, however that no increase will be made in the case of Fundamental Change if at least 90% of the consideration paid of the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of shares of capital stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange or another U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ National Market or another established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or that will be so traded or quoted immediately following the transaction) and as a result of such transaction or transactions the notes become convertible solely into such common stock. The Company shall give notice in writing to all record Noteholders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than 30 scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event.
     (e) (i) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change that occurs prior to May [___], 2013, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below. Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to Section 13.02(d) below. For purposes of this Section 13.01(e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection" with a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in Section 13.01(d) (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) or (c) of this Section 13.01 shall apply to such conversion).
Additional Shares
     (ii) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the ""), and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; further that if (1) the Stock Price is greater than $[] per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate, and (2) the Stock Price is less than $[] per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed [] per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04).

     (iii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.04 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).
 
          Section 13.02.
Conversion Procedure.
     (a) Subject to Section 13.02(b), the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (k) below. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
     (b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.01(e) pursuant to this clause (b).
     (A) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is prior to the third Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.02(b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.01(e)) on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to be paid to holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
     (B) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is on or following the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.01(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 13.01(e) above) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
 
     (c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i) and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (A) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i), and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 13.02(c).
Notice of Conversion
Conversion Date
     No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be tendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.01 or 14.02, as the case may be.
     If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
     (d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in Section 13.02(a), except to the extent specified in Section 13.02(b). The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Conversion Agent or to the holder of the Note surrendered for conversion, or such holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to the Conversion Agent or to such holder, or such holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
     (e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.
     (f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision
 
thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
     (g) Except as provided in Section 13.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
     (h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
     (i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a record date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any r egular record date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Notes so converted; , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (ii) to the extent of any overdue interest existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Notes.
provided, however
     (j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided, however,
 
     (k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
          Section 13.03.
[Intentionally Omitted].
          Section 13.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
     (a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combination into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
 
     (b) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance thereof) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
     (c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 13.04(a)), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (including securities, but excluding dividends and distributions covered by Section 13.04(b) or Section 13.04(d) and distributions described below in this paragraph (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 13.04(c) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 4:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP above.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten Trading Days following any Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to ten days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of trading days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the conversion date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
provided
     Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 13.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 13.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or
Trigger Event
 
other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
     For purposes of this Section 13.04(c), Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 13.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) applies or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) or Section 13.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 13.04(b) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 13.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Record Date" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to such event" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a).
     (d) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 13.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 13.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     (e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
 
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made if the application of the foregoing formulae would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 13.04 the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
     (g) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 13.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article XIII shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 13.04. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less
 
than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity.
     (i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (j) In any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 13.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 13.04(b), or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 13.04(e) (each an ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Note converted after such Adjustment Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the amounts deliverable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 13.04. For purposes of this Section 13.04(j), the term "" shall mean:
Adjustment Determination Date
Adjustment Event
     (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
     (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
     (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
     (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
 
     (k) For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (l) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Notes prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
          Section 13.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
Shares to Be Fully Paid
          Section 13.06. .
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in either case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a "", then:
Merger Event
)
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01(a) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV herein.
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 13.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with
 
respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 13.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed to a right to convert such Note by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Noteholder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Notes into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 13.02(b). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII hereof prior to the effective date.
Reference Property
     (c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at his address appearing on the Note register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
          Section 13.07. .
Certain Covenants
     (a) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
     (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued
 
upon conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company will, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
          Section 13.08. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
Responsibility of Trustee
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 13.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
          Section 13.09. .
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
     In case:
     (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.04; or
     (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants, or
     (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from
 
par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Noteholder at his address appearing on the Note register, provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty days prior to the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below, as the case may be, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
          Section 13.10. . Upon conversion of the Notes, the holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the associated rights issued under the Rights Plan or under any future shareholder rights plan the Company adopts unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the Rights Plan. If, and only if, the holders receive rights under such shareholder rights plans as described in the preceding sentence upon conversion of their Notes, then no other adjustment pursuant to this Article XIII shall be made in connection with such shareholder rights plans.

EXHIBIT 5.1
SanDisk Corporation 140 Caspian Court Sunnyvale, California 94089
     Re:  
Registration of Securities of SanDisk Corporation
Ladies and Gentlemen:
          At your request, we have examined the Registration Statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3 of SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), of the following securities by the Company:
- shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and the associated rights (the "Rights") to purchase shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, which are attached to all outstanding shares of Common Stock; and
- Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 (the "Debt Securities") which may be issued under an indenture (including any supplements thereto, an "Indenture") to be dated on or about the date of the first issuance of the Debt Securities, between the Company and a trustee to be selected by the Company, the form of which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement.
          The Common Stock and the Debt Securities are collectively referred to as the "Securities". The Securities are being registered for offering and sale from time to time pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act. The Registration Statement provides that the Securities may be offered in amounts, at prices and on terms to be set forth in one or more prospectus supplements to the Prospectus.
          Subject to certain proposed additional proceedings being taken as contemplated by the Registration Statement prior to the issuance and sale of the Securities being offered by the Company, we are of the opinion that:
1. With respect to the Common Stock offered under the Registration Statement, the Common Stock will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, upon payment for and delivery of the Common Stock as contemplated by the Registration Statement, the Common Stock will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
2. With respect to any series of Debt Securities issued under an Indenture and offered under the Registration Statement, the Debt Securities will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and, upon payment for and delivery of the Debt Securities in accordance with the Registration Statement will be legally valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally (including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), and by general principles of equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
          We hereby consent to the use of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the reference to this firm under the heading "Legal Matters" in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Securities constituting part of the Registration Statement.
Very truly yours,

ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On May 9, 2006, the Registrant entered into an Underwriting Agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs & Co. as representatives of the several underwriters with respect to the sale of up to $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of the Registrant's 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes"). The Underwriting Agreement is attached hereto at Exhibit 1.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.
On May 9 and May 10, 2006, the Registrant entered into hedge transactions with respect to the Notes and the Registrant's common stock (the "purchased call options") with Morgan Stanley International Limited, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (together with Morgan Stanley International Limited, the "dealers"). The Registrant will use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to pay the net cost of the purchased call options. The purchased call options will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to 13,963,990 shares of the Registrant's common stock. The purchased call options increase the effective conversion price of the Notes from the Registrant's perspective and are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes if the market price of the Registrant's common stock is greater than $82.36 per share. If the market value per share of the Registrant's common stock at the time of any exercise under the purchased call options is above such strike price, the purchased call options will entitle the Registrant to receive from the dealers net shares of the Registrant's common stock based on the excess of the then current market price of the Registrant's common stock over the strike price of the purchased call options.
Concurrently with entering into the purchased call options, the Registrant also entered into warrant transactions whereby the Registrant sold to the dealers warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 13,963,900 shares of the Registrant's common stock at an exercise price of $95.025 per share (the "sold warrants"). The sold warrants require the Registrant to deliver to the dealers up to 13,963,900 shares of the Registrant's common stock, subject to adjustment. If the market value of the Registrant's common stock at the maturity of the sold warrants, if not otherwise exercised earlier by the dealers, exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants, the dilution mitigation under the purchased call options will be capped, which means that there would be dilution from conversion of the Notes to the extent that the then market value per share of the Registrant's common stock exceeds the strike price of the sold warrants at the time of conversion.
The net effect of entering into the purchased call options and sold warrants will be to decrease the Registrant's total stockholders' equity by approximately $77.4 million, the net cost to the Registrant of the purchased call options and sold warrants.
The purchased call options and sold warrants are separate transactions entered into by the Registrant with the dealers, are not part of the terms of the Notes and will not affect the holders' rights under the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the purchased call options or the sold warrants.
On May 15, 2006, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Registrant entered into an Indenture with respect to the Notes with The Bank of New York, as trustee. The Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

     (e) If the Time of Sale Prospectus is being used to solicit offers to buy the Securities at a time when the Prospectus is not yet available to prospective purchasers and any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which the Time of Sale Prospectus conflicts with the information contained in the Registration Statement then on file, or if, in the opinion of counsel for the Underwriters, it is necessary to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Prospectus to comply with applicable law, forthwith to prepare, file with the Commission and furnish, at its own expense, to the Underwriters and to any dealer upon request, either amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Prospectus so that the statements in the Time of Sale Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when delivered to a prospective purchaser, be misleading or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will no longer conflict with the Registration Statement, or so that the Time of Sale Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

so that the statements in the Prospectus as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the circumstances when the Prospectus (or in lieu thereof the notice referred to in Rule 173(a) under the Securities Act) is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading or so that the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, will comply with applicable law.

7. Covenants of the Underwriters
     . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any electronic roadshow or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
8. Indemnity and Contribution
 
necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in which they were made not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any issuer free writing prospectus used by the Underwriters in violation of Section 7 hereof.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule III hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein (other than with respect to Section 8(a) in cases in which Section 8(b) is applicable), then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
pro rata
 
considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
9. Termination
     . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.

provided
     (b) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely exclusively on an Officers' Certificate).
          Section 5.01.   . The following events shall be Events of Default with respect to the Notes:
Events of Default
     (a) default in any payment of interest, on any Note when due and payable and the default continues for a period of 30 days;
     (b) default in the payment of principal of any Note when due and payable on the Maturity Date, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;
     (c) failure by the Company to comply with its obligation to convert the Notes into cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock, as applicable, upon exercise of a holder's conversion right;
     (d) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Article X;
     (e) failure by the Company to issue a Designated Event Company Notice in accordance with Section 14.01(b) when due;
 
     (f) failure by the Company for 60 days to comply with any of its other agreements (other than a covenant or warranty or default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically provided for) contained in the Notes or the Indenture after written notice of such default from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding has been received by the Company;
     (g) default by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in the payment of the principal or interest on any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any debt for money borrowed in excess of $50 million in the aggregate of the Company and/or any such Subsidiary, whether such debt now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default results in such debt becoming or being declared due and payable, and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled within 30 days after written notice of such acceleration has been received by the Company or such Subsidiary;
     (h) the Company shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; or
     (i) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.
     In case one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) with respect to the Company), unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Noteholders), may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes contained to the contrary notwithstanding. If an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) occurs and is continuing with respect to the Company, the principal of all the Notes and accrued and unpaid interest shall be immediately
 
due and payable. This provision, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Notes and the principal of any and all Notes that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by the Notes during the period of such Default) and amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.06, and if (1) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) any and all Events of Defaults under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on Notes that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 5.07, then and in every such case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Notes and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. The Company shall notify the Responsible Officer of the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
     In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.
          Section 5.02.   . In the event that the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding hereunder have declared the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes, to be due and payable immediately in accordance with Section 5.01, and the Company shall have failed forthwith to pay such amounts, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, after being furnished suitable indemnity pursuant to Section 6.01, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid (including such further amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities incurred by the Trustee hereunder other than through its negligence or bad faith), and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final degree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor on the Notes and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be payable.
Payments of Notes on Default; Suit Therefor
 
     In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Notes under title 11 of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of the Company or such other obligor, or in the case of any other judicial proceedings relative to the Company or such other obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.02, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents and to take such other actions as it may deem necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Noteholders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the Notes, its or their creditors, or its or their property, and to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the deduction of any amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06; and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, custodian or similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Noteholders to make such payments to the Trustee, as administrative expenses, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements, including agents and counsel fees, and including any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.06 hereof, incurred by it up to the date of such distribution. To the extent that such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property which the holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Noteholder or the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding.
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes.
     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee
 
shall be held to represent all the holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of the Notes parties to any such proceedings.
          Section 5.03.   . Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V with respect to the Notes shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:
Application of Monies Collected by Trustee
     First, to the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 6.06;
     Second, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the Notes in default in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes, such payments to be made ratably to the Persons entitled thereto;
     Third, in case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, and be unpaid to the payment of the whole amount (including, if applicable, payments in respect of the Conversion Obligation and Additional Shares) then owing and unpaid upon the Notes for principal and interest, with interest on the overdue principal (to the extent that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Notes, and in case such monies shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and unpaid upon the Notes, then to the payment of such principal and interest without preference or priority of principal over interest, or of interest over principal or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Note over any other Note, ratably to the aggregate of such principal and accrued and unpaid interest; and
     Fourth, to the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or any other Person lawfully entitled thereto.
          Section 5.04.   . No holder of any Note shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, liquidator, custodian or other similar official, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for sixty (60) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and no direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee by the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding pursuant to Section 5.07; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Note with every other taker and holder and the
Proceedings by Noteholders
 
Trustee, that no one or more Noteholders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other Noteholder, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Noteholders (except as otherwise provided herein). For the protection and enforcement of this Section 5.04, each and every Noteholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any provision of any Note, the right of any Noteholder to receive payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note, or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the Company shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Noteholder.
     Anything in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, the holder of any Note, without the consent of either the Trustee or the holder of any other Note, in his own behalf and for his own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and maintain any proceeding suitable to enforce, his rights of conversion as provided herein.
          Section 5.05.   . In case of an Event of Default the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by taw.
Proceedings by Trustee
          Section 5.06.   . Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article V to the Trustee or to the Noteholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.04, every power and remedy given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Noteholders.
Remedies Cumulative and Continuing
          Section 5.07.   . The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to Notes; , , that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with
Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by Majority of Noteholders
provided
however
 
such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of and accrued and unpaid interest on, or the principal of, the Notes when due which has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.01, (ii) a failure by the Company to deliver cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) upon conversion of the Notes, or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provisions hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.07, said default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 5.08.   . The Trustee shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence and continuance of a Default of which a Responsible Officer has actual knowledge, mail to all Noteholders as the names and addresses of such holders appear upon the Note register, notice of all Defaults known to a Responsible Officer, unless such Defaults shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice; and that, except in the case of a Default in the payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on any of the Notes, then in any such event the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Noteholders.
Notice of Defaults
provided
     Section 5.09.   . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Note by his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; that the provisions of this Section 5.09 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, or to any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on any Note on or after the due date expressed in such Note or to any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII.
Undertaking to Pay Costs
provided
 
        Section 6.01.   . The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiver of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs; that if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity or security against loss, liability or expense.
Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee
provided
     No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own grossly negligent action, its own grossly negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that
     (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred:
     (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and, after it has been qualified thereunder, the Trust Indenture Act, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act against the Trustee; and
     (ii) in the absence of bad faith and willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;
     (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be established by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Trustee was grossly negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
     (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith and either (i) believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture or (ii) in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined as provided in Section 7.04 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
 
available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture;
     (d) whether or not therein provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section;

     (f) if any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the fact of which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely on its failure to receive such notice as reason to act as if no such event occurred, unless such Responsible Officer of the Trustee had actual knowledge of such event;
     (g) in the absence of written investment direction from the Company, all cash received by the Trustee shall be placed in a non-interest bearing trust account. In no event shall the Trustee be liable for the selection of investments or for investment losses incurred thereon or for losses incurred as a result of the liquidation of any such investments prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investments prior to its stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investment to provide timely written investment direction, and the Trustee shall have no obligation to invest or reinvest any amounts held hereunder in the absence of such written investment direction from the Company; and
     (h) in the event that the Trustee is also acting as Custodian, Note Registrar, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or transfer agent hereunder, the rights and protections afforded to the Trustee pursuant to this Article VI shall also be afforded to it in its capacity as such.
     None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers.

     (c) the Trustee may consult with counsel and require an Opinion of Counsel and any advice of such counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;
     (d) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Noteholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Noteholders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby;
     (e) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee from the Noteholders against such expenses or liability as a condition to so proceeding; the reasonable expenses of every such examination shall be paid by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand;
provided, however,
     (f) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents, custodians, nominees or attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent, custodian, nominee or attorney appointed by it with due care hereunder, and
     (g) the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties.
     (h) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon Officers' Certificates or Opinions of Counsel furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such Certificates or Opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein); and
     (i) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers' Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of officers' authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person authorized to sign Officers' Certificate, including any person specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered and not superseded.
     In no event shall the Trustee be liable for any consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action other than through the Trustee's willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes, unless either (1) a Responsible Officer shall have actual knowledge of such default or Event of Default or (2) written notice of such default or Event of Default shall have been given to the Trustee by the Company or by any holder of the Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and this Indenture; and the permissive rights of the Trustee enumerated herein shall not be construed as duties.

     (c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, as determined in accordance with Section 7.04, may at any time remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee which shall be deemed appointed as successor trustee unless within ten (10) days after notice to the Company of such nomination the Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so removed or any Noteholder, upon the terms and conditions and otherwise as in Section 6.10(a) provided, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.
     (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 6.11.

Acceptance by Successor Trustee
 
successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.06, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property and funds held or collected by such trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for the benefit of holders of particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.06.
     No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.08 and be eligible under the provisions of Section 6.09.

Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section. Whenever the Company or the Trustee solicits the taking of any action by the holders of the Notes, the Company or the Trustee may fix, but shall not be required to, in advance of such solicitation, a date as the record date for determining Noteholders entitled to take such action. The record date if one is selected shall be not more than fifteen (15) days prior to the date of commencement of solicitation of such action.

Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners
 
account of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, for conversion of such Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any Conversion Agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any holder for the time being, or upon his order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for monies payable upon any such Note.

Notes so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section 7.04 if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right to vote such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company, any other obligor on the Notes or a person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In the case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Notes, if any, known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described persons; and, subject to Section 6.01, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Notes not listed therein are outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.

     (a) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "") if not the Company shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Notes, this Indenture and, to the extent that it is otherwise still operative, shall expressly assume all the obligations of the Company under the Registration Rights Agreement; and
Successor Company
     (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
     For purposes of this Section 10.01, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Company, which properties and assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.
          Section 10.02. . In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and upon the assumption by the Successor Company, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due and punctual payment of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Notes, the due and punctual conversion of the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Company, such Successor Company shall succeed to and be substituted for the Company and the Company shall be released from those obligations, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the party of the first part. Such Successor Company thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of the Company any or all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and, upon the order of such Successor Company instead of the Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver, or cause to be authenticated and delivered, any Notes which previously shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any Notes which such Successor Company thereafter shall cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Notes so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Notes theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Notes had been issued at the date of the execution hereof. In the event of any such consolidation, merger,

conveyance, transfer or lease, the person named as the "Company" in the first paragraph of this Indenture or any successor which shall thereafter have become such in the manner prescribed in this Article X may be dissolved, wound up and liquidated at any time thereafter and such person shall be released from its liabilities as obligor and maker of the Notes and from its obligations under this Indenture.
     In case of any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may be made in the Notes thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.
          Section 10.03. . No merger, consolidation, sale transfer or lease shall be effective unless the Trustee shall receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and any such assumption complies with the provisions of this Article X.
Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel to Be Given Trustee
          Section 11.01. . When (a) the Company shall deliver to the Note Registrar for cancellation all Notes theretofore authenticated (other than any Notes that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered) and not theretofore canceled, or (b) all the Notes not theretofore canceled or delivered to the Notes registrar for cancellation shall have become due and payable, whether on the Maturity Date or on any earlier Designated Event Repurchase Date or otherwise, and the Company shall deposit with the Trustee, in trust, cash or shares of Common Stock, as applicable, sufficient to pay at maturity all of the Notes (other than any Notes that shall have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered) not theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal and accrued and unpaid interest due thereon, and if the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect except as to (i) the right of holders to receive payments of principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, and any unpaid Conversion Obligation and Additional Shares, if any, on, the Notes and the other rights, duties and obligations of Noteholders, as beneficiaries hereof with respect to the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee (ii) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (iii) the obligations of the Company under Section 6.06, and the Trustee, on written demand of the Company accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as required by Section 15.05 and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture; the Company, however, hereby agrees to reimburse the Trustee for any costs or expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred by the Trustee and to compensate the Trustee for any services thereafter reasonably and properly rendered by the Trustee in connection with this Indenture or the Notes.
Discharge of Indenture
          Section 11.02. . Subject to Section 11.04, all monies deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 11.01 shall be held in

          Section 11.03. . Upon the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, all monies then held by any Paying Agent of the Notes (other than the Trustee) shall, upon written request of the Company, be repaid to it or paid to the Trustee, and thereupon such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such monies.
Paying Agent to Repay Monies Held
          Section 11.04. . Subject to the requirements of applicable law, any monies deposited with or paid to the Trustee for payment of the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest on, Notes and not applied but remaining unclaimed by the Noteholders for two years after the date upon which the principal of or accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes, as the case may be, shall have become due and payable, shall be repaid to the Company by the Trustee on written request and all liability of the Trustee shall thereupon cease with respect to such monies; and the holder of any of the Notes shall thereafter look only to the Company for any payment which such holder may be entitled to collect unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another person. The Trustee shall, promptly after such payment of the principal of, and any accrued and unpaid interest, on Notes, as described in this Section 11.04 and upon written request of the Company, return to the Company any funds in excess of the amount required for such payment.
Return of Unclaimed Monies
          Section 11.05. . If (i) the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with Section 11.02 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application and (ii) the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes so request by written notice to the Trustee, the Company's obligations under this Indenture shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 11.01 until such time as the Trustee or the Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 11.02; , that if the Company makes any payment of interest on or principal of any Note following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Noteholders to receive such payment from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that all such liability is hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of the Notes.
          Section 13.01. .
Conversion Privilege
     (a) Subject to the conditions described in clause (i), (ii), and (iii) below, and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article XIII, a Noteholder shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Note at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding February 15, 2013 at a rate (the "") of 12.1426 shares of Common Stock (subject to adjustment by the Company as provided in Section 13.04) per $1,000 principal amount Note (the "") under the circumstances and during the periods set forth below. On and after February 15, 2013, regardless of the conditions described in clause (i), (ii) and (iii) below, and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article XIII, a Noteholder shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert all or any portion (if the portion to be converted is $1,000 principal amount or an integral multiple thereof) of such Note at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date.
Conversion Rate
Conversion Obligation
     (i) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February 15, 2013, during the five Business Day period immediately after any five consecutive Trading Day period (the "") in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on such date and the Conversion Rate on such date, all as determined by the Trustee. The Trustee shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes unless requested by the Company to do so in writing, and the Company shall have no obligation to make such request unless a Noteholder provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price of the Notes would be less than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price at such time, at which time the Company shall instruct the Trustee to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per Note is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date. If the Trading Price condition set forth above has been met, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders. If, at any time after the Trading Price condition set forth above has been met, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date, the Company shall so notify the Noteholders.
Measurement Period
 
     (ii) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February 15, 2013, during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2006, if the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for twenty (20) or more Trading Days in a period of thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days ending on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the applicable Conversion Price in effect on the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
     (iii) The Notes shall be convertible prior to February 15, 2013 as provided in Section 13.01(b), Section 13.01(c) and Section 13.01(d).
     (b) In the event that the Company elects to:
     (i) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at a price less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock for the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution; or
     (ii) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, assets or debt securities of the Company or rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value (as determined by the Board of Directors) exceeding 10% of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the day immediately preceding the date of declaration of such distribution,
then, in either case, holders may surrender the Notes for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company provides notice to holders referred to in the next sentence until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. The Company shall notify holders of any distribution referred to in either clause (i) or clause (ii) above and of the resulting conversion right no later than the 20 Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Holders may not exercise this right if such Holder participates in the distribution without conversion.
th
     (c) If the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, then the holders shall have the right to convert Notes at any time beginning fifteen calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date that is fifteen calendar days after the date that is the effective date of such transaction; such transaction does not otherwise constitute a Designated Event to which the provisions of Section 13.01(d) shall apply. The Company will notify holders of Notes at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Day prior to such 15th day.
provided
 
     (d) If the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes a Designated Event, a holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the 30th scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Repurchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in Section 13.01(e). The Company shall give notice in writing to all record Noteholders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than 30 scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event.
     (e) (i) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change that occurs prior to May 15, 2013, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below; provided, however, that no increase will be made in the case of Fundamental Change if at least 90% of the consideration paid for the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of shares of capital stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange or another U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on NASDAQ National Market or another established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or that will be so traded or quoted immediately following the transaction) and as a result of such transaction or transactions the notes become convertible solely into such common stock. Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to Section 13.02(d) below. For purposes of this Section 13.01(e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection" with a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in Section 13.01(d) (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) or (c) of this Section 13.01 shall apply to such conversion).
Additional Shares
     (ii) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the ""), and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; further that if (1) the Stock Price is greater than $300.00 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate, and (2) the Stock Price is less than $ 63.35 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 15.7853 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04).
Effective Date
provided
provided
     (iii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.04 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).
 
          Section 13.02.
Conversion Procedure.
     (a) Subject to Section 13.02(b), the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (k) below. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
     (b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.01(e) pursuant to this clause (b).
     (A) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is prior to the third Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.02(b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.01(e)) on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to be paid to holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
     (B) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is on or following the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.01(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 13.01(e) above) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
 
     (c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i) and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (A) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i), and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 13.02(c).
Notice of Conversion
Conversion Date
     No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be tendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.01 or 14.02, as the case may be.
     If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
     (d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in Section 13.02(a), except to the extent specified in Section 13.02(b). The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Conversion Agent or to the holder of the Note surrendered for conversion, or such holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to the Conversion Agent or to such holder, or such holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
     (e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.
     (f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision
 
thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
     (g) Except as provided in Section 13.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
     (h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
     (i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a record date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any r egular record date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Notes so converted; , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (ii) to the extent of any overdue interest existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Notes.
provided, however
     (j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided, however,
 
     (k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
          Section 13.03.
[Intentionally Omitted].
          Section 13.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
     (a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combination into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
 
     (b) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance thereof) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
     (c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 13.04(a)), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (including securities, but excluding dividends and distributions covered by Section 13.04(b) or Section 13.04(d) and distributions described below in this paragraph (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 13.04(c) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property

Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 4:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP above.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten Trading Days following any Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to ten days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of trading days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the conversion date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
provided
     Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 13.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 13.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or
Trigger Event
 
other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
     For purposes of this Section 13.04(c), Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 13.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) applies or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) or Section 13.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 13.04(b) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 13.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Record Date" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to such event" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a).
     (d) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 13.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 13.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     (e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
 
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made if the application of the foregoing formulae would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 13.04 the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
     (g) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 13.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article XIII shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 13.04. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less
 
than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity.
     (i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (j) In any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 13.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 13.04(b), or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 13.04(e) (each an ""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Note converted after such Adjustment Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the amounts deliverable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 13.04. For purposes of this Section 13.04(j), the term "" shall mean:
Adjustment Determination Date
Adjustment Event
     (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
     (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
     (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
     (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
 
     (k) For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (l) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Notes prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
          Section 13.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
Shares to Be Fully Paid

Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in either case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a "", then:
Merger Event
)
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01(a) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV herein.
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 13.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with
 
respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 13.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed to a right to convert such Note by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Noteholder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Notes into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 13.02(b). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII hereof prior to the effective date.
Reference Property
     (c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at his address appearing on the Note register provided for in this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
          Section 13.07. .
Certain Covenants
     (a) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
     (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued
 
upon conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company will, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
          Section 13.08. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Noteholder to determine the Conversion Rate or whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
Responsibility of Trustee
     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 13.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
          Section 13.09. .
Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions
     In case:
     (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.04; or
     (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to all of the holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or warrants, or
     (c) of any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in par value, or from
 
par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or
     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;
the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each Noteholder at his address appearing on the Note register, provided for in Section 2.06 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but in any event at least twenty days prior to the applicable date specified in clause (x) or (y) below, as the case may be, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.
          Section 13.10. . Upon conversion of the Notes, the holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the associated rights issued under the Rights Plan or under any future shareholder rights plan the Company adopts unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the Rights Plan. If, and only if, the holders receive rights under such shareholder rights plans as described in the preceding sentence upon conversion of their Notes, then no other adjustment pursuant to this Article XIII shall be made in connection with such shareholder rights plans.

TRUSTEE'S CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICATION THE BANK OF NEW YORK, as Trustee, certifies that this is one of the Notes described in the within-named Indenture.
 
     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Company, designated as its 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (herein called the "Notes"), issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of May 15, 2006 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York (herein called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Notes. Additional Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.
     In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all Notes, may be declared, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the Designated Event Repurchase Price and the principal amount on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the holder who surrenders a Note to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
     The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, and in other circumstances, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Notes; that no such supplemental indenture shall make any of the changes set forth in Section 9.02 of the Indenture, without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby. It is also provided in the Indenture that, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of the Notes, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences except as provided in the Indenture. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.
provided, however,
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay
 
the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, this Note, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
     The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples thereof. At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face hereof, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without payment of any service charge but with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration or exchange of Notes, Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations.
     The Notes are not subject to redemption through the operation of any sinking fund.
     Upon the occurrence of a Designated Event, the holder has the right, at such holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase all of such holder's Notes or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Designated Event Repurchase Date at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes such holder elects to require the Company to repurchase, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Designated Event Repurchase Date. The Company or, at the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall mail to all holders of record of the Notes a notice of the occurrence of a Designated Event and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof on or before the tenth day after the occurrence of any Designated Event.
     Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the holder hereof has the right, at its option, on and after February 15, 2013, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain conditions specified in the Indenture and prior to the close of business on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, to convert any Notes or portion thereof which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof, into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock, in each case at the Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, as adjusted from time to time as provided in the Indenture, upon surrender of this Note, together with a Notice of Conversion, a form of which is attached to the Note, as provided in the Indenture and this Note, to the Company at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or at the option of such holder, the Corporate Trust Office, and, unless the shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this Note, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the holder or by his duly authorized attorney. The initial Conversion Rate shall be 12.1426 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon any conversion, but an adjustment in cash will be paid to the holder, as provided in the Indenture, in respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the surrender of any Note or Notes for conversion. No adjustment shall be made for dividends or any shares issued upon conversion of such Note except as provided in the Indenture.
     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange thereof, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without
 
charge except for any tax, assessments or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
     The Company, the Trustee, any authenticating agent, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent and any Note Registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, for the conversion hereof and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any other authenticating agent nor any Paying Agent nor any other Conversion Agent nor any Note Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such registered holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, satisfy and discharge liability for monies payable on this Note.
     No recourse for the payment of the principal of, or accrued and unpaid interest on, this Note, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent, officer, director or subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

2005 Incentive Plan Amendments
     The Board of Directors (the "Board") of SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") has previously approved amendments to the SanDisk Corporation 2005 Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") that would (i) increase the number of shares of the Registrant's common stock ("Common Stock") that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2005 Plan by an additional 15,000,000 shares, which is expected to be used over multiple years, and (ii) give the Registrant the flexibility to grant certain performance-based awards that would be payable in cash and would be designed to satisfy the requirements for deductibility of compensation under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Registrant's stockholders approved the 2005 Plan amendments at the annual stockholders meeting held on May 25, 2006.
     The following summary of the 2005 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2005 Plan, which was previously filed as Annex A to the Registrant's proxy statement dated April 12, 2006.
     The 2005 Plan consists of three separate incentive programs: (i) the discretionary grant program under which eligible individuals may be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock at the fair market value per share on the grant date or stock appreciation rights with a base price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the grant date; (ii) the stock issuance and cash bonus programs under which eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards, which may be subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting requirements, and cash bonus opportunities intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"); and (iii) the automatic grant program for the non-employee members of the Registrant's board of directors pursuant to which new and continuing non-employee board members are to receive grants (in the form of stock options and/or restricted stock or restricted stock units) automatically at periodic intervals over their period of board service. Participation in the discretionary grant and stock issuance and cash bonus programs is limited to employees of the Registrant and its subsidiaries, non-employee members of the Registrant's board of directors or the board of directors of any subsidiary, and consultants and other independent advisors in the service of the Registrant or any subsidiary.
     The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2005 Plan equals the sum of (1) 20,700,000 shares (after giving effect to the 2005 Plan amendments), plus (2) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the Registrant's 1995 Stock Option Plan or the Registrant's 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan and outstanding as of May 27, 2005 that expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised. No participant in the 2005 Plan may receive option grants, stand-alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances (whether vested or unvested) or other stock-based awards for more than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in any single calendar year. The maximum number of shares which may be issued without cash consideration under the stock issuance program may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock from time-to-time authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan.
     The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the 2005 Plan. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the 2005 Plan to the Compensation
Table of Contents
Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"). The plan administrator has full power and authority (subject to the express terms of the 2005 Plan) to select the individuals who are to receive awards under the discretionary grant and stock issuance and cash bonus programs and to determine the time or times when those awards are to be made, the number of shares and the vesting schedule applicable to each award and the remaining terms and conditions of each such award.
     As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the 2005 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase price of awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.
.
Grant of Performance-Based Cash Bonus Awards
     The Compensation Committee previously approved, subject to stockholder approval of the 2005 Plan amendments at the Annual Meeting, performance-based bonus awards for 2006 under the 2005 Plan that are payable in cash and intended to satisfy the requirements for tax deductibility under Section 162(m) as described above. These awards became effective upon stockholder approval of the 2005 Plan amendments. The recipients of the awards are Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra, Judy Bruner, Nelson Chan, Yoram Cedar and Randhir Thakur. The target bonus awards are 100% of base salary for Dr. Harari, 85% of base salary for Mr. Mehrotra, and 75% of base salary for Ms. Bruner, Messrs. Chan and Cedar and Dr. Thakur. The bonuses payable under the awards range from 0% of the target bonus up to a maximum of 375% of the target bonus based on the Registrant's 2006 revenue and 2006 after-tax income, excluding stock compensation and acquisition related charges. The Compensation Committee will retain discretion to reduce, but not increase, the amount of the bonus payable pursuant to each executive's award based on individual performance during 2006.
.
Amendment to Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement
     Separately, on May 29, 2006, the Registrant entered into Amendment No. 2 (the "Amendment") to Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement dated as of April 10, 2002, as amended on May 29, 2002 (as amended, the "Indemnification Agreement") with Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba"). As previously disclosed in the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2002, in May 2002, FlashVision, the Registrant's 49.9%-owned business venture with Toshiba, secured an equipment lease arrangement of approximately 37.9 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $337 million based upon the exchange rate at May 31, 2006, with a syndicate of Japanese lenders. Under the terms of the lease, Toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of FlashVision and the Registrant agreed to indemnify Toshiba for certain liabilities Toshiba incurs as a result of Toshiba's guarantee of the FlashVision equipment lease arrangement. Under the terms of the Indemnification Agreement, if FlashVision fails to meet its lease commitments, and Toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of Toshiba's guarantee, then the Registrant will be obligated to reimburse Toshiba for 49.9% of any claims and associated expenses under the lease, unless the claims result from Toshiba's failure to meet its obligations to FlashVision or its covenants to the lenders.
Table of Contents
     In May 2006, in connection with the expiration of the original equipment lease arrangement, FlashVision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately 15 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $134 million based upon the exchange rate at May 31, 2006, with a syndicate of Japanese lenders for an additional three years until May 2009, on terms substantially similar to those of the original lease arrangement. In connection therewith, the Registrant entered into the Amendment solely for the purpose of applying the terms of the Indemnification Agreement to the new equipment lease arrangement. No amount remains outstanding under the original equipment lease arrangement.
     As of May 31, 2006, the maximum amount of the Registrant's contingent indemnification obligation was approximately 7.5 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $67 million based upon the exchange rate at May 31, 2006.
     The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Amendment is qualified by reference in its entirety to the full text of the Amendment, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending July 2, 2006.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     The disclosure in Item 1.01 under the heading "Amendment to Indemnification and Reimbursement Agreement." is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
     The Board had previously approved an amendment to Section A of Article IV of the Registrant's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the Registrant's authorized common stock from 400,000,000 shares to 800,000,000 shares (the "Common Stock Increase"), subject to stockholder approval.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT
On June 20, 2006, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement") with IBJ Leasing Co., Ltd. ("IBJ"), Sumisho Lease Co., Ltd. ("Sumisho") and Toshiba Finance Corporation (together with IBJ and Sumisho, the "Lessors"). Under this Guarantee Agreement, SanDisk will guarantee 50% of the payment obligations of Flash Partners Yugen Kaisha ("Flash Partners"), SanDisk's 49.9%-owned flash memory manufacturing company formed with Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba"), to the Lessors under a Basic Lease Contract for lease of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to be installed in Fab 3 at Toshiba's Yokkaichi operations (the "Basic Lease Contract") dated as of June 20, 2006 among Flash Partners (the "Lessee") and the Lessors. Toshiba has entered into a similar guarantee agreement with IBJ and Sumisho, as to which SanDisk has no additional guarantee obligations. SanDisk's guarantee obligation represents 50% of Flash Partners' 32 billion, or approximately $275 million based upon the exchange rate at June 23, 2006, obligation to the Lessors under the Basic Lease Contract.
Under the Basic Lease Contract, Flash Partners will lease flash memory manufacturing equipment from the Lessors for a period of four or five years, as specified in each drawdown under the Basic Lease Contract, and is obligated to make quarterly lease payments. The Basic Lease Contract also provides Flash Partners with an option to purchase the leased equipment at fair market value at the time of purchase.
If Flash Partners defaults on any of its financial obligations under the Basic Lease Contract guaranteed by SanDisk, the Lessors may make a written demand that SanDisk perform such obligations within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of the written demand, so long as the Lessors have first provided Flash Partners with 10 business days to cure such default.
Additionally, the Lessors may terminate the Basic Lease Contract and accelerate all of Flash Partners' obligations under the Basic Lease Contract upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Flash Partners' failure to make payments under the Basic Lease Contract or related agreements, and the applicable payments are not made within two banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (2) Flash Partners' failure to obtain and maintain required insurance over the leased equipment; (3) Flash Partners' failure to release encumbrances over the leased equipment; (4) Flash Partners' breach of any provision of any related agreement, which breach is not cured within 10 banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (5) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba is subject to compulsory execution, petition for auction or disposition for failure to pay taxes and public dues, or a petition for the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings (including a petition for a similar procedure or disposition under foreign law) unless the relevant petition or disposition is cancelled or dissolved within 30 calendar days; (6) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba discontinues all or a material part of its business, or adopts a resolution of dissolution without the approval of the Lessors; (7) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba assigns all or a material part of its business without the consent of the Lessors; (8) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba suspends payment, or any
 
clearing bank undertakes procedures for suspension of transactions by Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba with banks and similar institutions; (9) there is a change in the interest ratio in Flash Partners directly or indirectly invested by each of Toshiba and SanDisk without the agreement of the Lessors; (10) the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004 among Toshiba, SanDisk and SanDisk International Limited is cancelled, dissolved or terminated; (11) any monetary obligation of Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba in excess of $20.0 million has become immediately due and payable, other than obligations in which the third-party creditor has explicitly or implicitly agreed or consented to the delinquency, including situations where industry custom provides that silence is deemed consent; (12) the total amount of equity on SanDisk's consolidated balance sheet as of any fiscal year end or the mid point of a fiscal year is less than $1.164 billion; (13) if the long-term loan rating of SanDisk by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Moody's Investors Service is decreased to below BB- or Ba3 respectively; or (14) any other significant change with respect to the assets of Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba that affects payments under the Basic Lease Contract (excluding changes that can be resolved within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice from the Lessors).
Upon the occurrence of any of these events, the Lessors may, at their option, terminate the Basic Lease Contract effective immediately upon written notice to Flash Partners, and the Lessors may demand in writing that SanDisk perform its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of such written demand.
Upon any such default or termination, SanDisk will be jointly and severally liable with Flash Partners to the Lessors to the extent of the guarantee, without any obligation on the part of the Lessors to first exhaust any remedies it may have against Flash Partners.
The foregoing summaries of the material terms of the Guarantee Agreement and the terms of the Basic Lease Agreement that are material with respect to SanDisk's obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Guarantee Agreement and the Basic Lease Agreement, each of which will be filed as exhibits to the SanDisk's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending July 2, 2006.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On July 7, 2006, SanDisk Corporation, or SanDisk, closed a transaction with Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba, under which SanDisk and Toshiba created a new semiconductor company, Flash Alliance, Ltd., a Japanese , owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba, and agreed to cooperate in the construction and equipping of an additional 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, Fab 4, to produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. Toshiba is bearing the cost to construct the Fab 4 building, which will be located in Yokkaichi, Japan, the site of the parties' current FlashVision and Flash Partners ventures. Both parties will equally share the cost of the manufacturing equipment as well as startup costs and initial design and development of manufacturing process technology, which costs are expected to be substantial, and depreciation of the Fab 4 building will be a component of the cost per wafer charged to each party. With the creation of Flash Alliance, Ltd., SanDisk and Toshiba are further expanding their current business relationship. In 2000, SanDisk and Toshiba formed a venture, FlashVision, to equip a 200-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility and to operate the facility and supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba, and in 2004, SanDisk and Toshiba formed an additional venture, Flash Partners, to equip a new 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility and to operate the facility and supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba.
tokurei yugen kaisha
     The capacity of Fab 4 at full expansion is expected to be greater than 100,000 wafers per month and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually agreed by the parties. To date, the parties have agreed to an expansion plan to 67,500 wafers per month for which the investment in Fab 4 is currently estimated at approximately $3.0 billion through the end of 2008, of which SanDisk's share is currently estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion. Initial NAND production is currently scheduled for the end of 2007. SanDisk will be entitled to 50% of the total wafer output. For expansion beyond 67,500 wafers per month, it is expected that investments and output would continue to be shared 50/50 between SanDisk and Toshiba. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.
     In connection with the Fab 4 transaction, SanDisk, SanDisk (Ireland) Limited, or SanDisk Ireland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk, and Toshiba entered into a Flash Alliance Master Agreement, or Master Agreement, and other ancillary agreements, each dated as of July 7, 2006, the material rights and obligations of which are described herein. The Master Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to equip and operate Fab 4. Under the terms of the Master Agreement, SanDisk is obligated to purchase half of Fab 4's NAND wafer production output. In addition to the Master Agreement, SanDisk Ireland and Toshiba entered into a Flash Alliance Operating Agreement, which sets forth the provisions governing the business of Flash Alliance, the conduct of Flash Alliance's affairs and the rights, powers, preferences, limitations and responsibilities of Flash Alliance's shareholders, employees and directors.
     SanDisk and Toshiba also entered into an Amended and Restated Common R&D and Participation Agreement, or Common R&D Agreement, and an Amended and Restated Product Development Agreement, or Product Development Agreement, each of which governs the FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance relationships. The Common R&D Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which SanDisk participates in Toshiba's development of certain manufacturing process technology common to each party's products. SanDisk's payment obligation under the Common R&D Agreement is based on a variable computation with certain payment caps and is paid in installments. The Product Development Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions upon which Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to jointly develop certain products and technologies, and SanDisk's payment obligation thereunder is based on a variable computation.
     In addition to the agreements described above, SanDisk, SanDisk Ireland and Toshiba also entered into a Patent Indemnification Agreement and SanDisk Ireland and Toshiba entered into a Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement. The Patent Indemnification Agreement provides for certain rights and obligations of each party for claims that NAND flash memory products manufactured and sold by Flash Alliance infringe third-party patents. Under the Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement, Toshiba and SanDisk Ireland have agreed to mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and Flash Alliance for, environmental remediation costs or liability resulting from Flash Alliance's manufacturing operations in certain circumstances.
     The above descriptions of the material terms of the Master Agreement, Flash Alliance Operating Agreement, Common R&D Agreement, Product Development Agreement, Patent Indemnification Agreement and Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of these agreements, which SanDisk intends to file as exhibits to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending October 1, 2006.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 24, 2006, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its second quarter ended July 2, 2006. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
     In addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for stock compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor in January 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and stock based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
     SUNNYVALE, CA, July 24, 2006  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended July 2, 2006. Total second quarter revenues increased 40% on a year-over-year basis to $719 million. Second quarter net income as reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $96 million, or $0.47 per diluted share.
     Excluding the impact of stock compensation expense and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and the related tax effect, second quarter non-GAAP net income grew 67% to $118 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, which compares to the second quarter 2005 GAAP results of $70 million, or $0.37 per diluted share.
     "The second quarter was an excellent quarter for both our OEM and our retail business. Mobile cards sold into handsets were the star performer with more than 15 million cards sold in the quarter. Our microSD card has become our number one product in units and our second largest product by revenue. Our Sansa e200 audio players have been well received, solidifying our clear #2 share for flash players in U.S. retail in the second quarter. Our SanDisk Extreme high performance cards for professional photographers were our fastest growing product line in the quarter. Solid execution of the 300-millimeter fab ramp and 8 gigabit 70-nanometer MLC shipments contributed to improved product margins despite a challenging industry-wide pricing environment. The cumulative pricing reductions implemented over the past two quarters are showing positive demand elasticity as evidenced by 20% growth in average capacity and 46% more megabytes sold compared to the first quarter," said Eli Harari, chairman and chief executive officer of SanDisk Corporation. "We are optimistic about growth in demand in our target markets in the second half and with Fab 3 costs steadily declining and our captive capacity ramping, we believe we are well positioned for the anticipated demand upswing in the back half of this year."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
     On July 30, 2006, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") and msystems Ltd. ("msystems") issued a joint press release announcing that they and Project Desert Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk ("Merger Sub"), had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 30, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub would merge (the "Merger") with and into msystems, with msystems surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk.
     Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, which has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, upon the completion of the Merger, each holder of msystems ordinary shares will have the right to receive, for each such msystems ordinary share, 0.76368 of a share of SanDisk common stock. Based on SanDisk's closing Nasdaq stock price of $47.14 per share on July 28, 2006, the transaction is valued at $36.00 per msystems share. msystems' stock options will generally convert upon completion of the Merger into stock options with respect to SanDisk common stock, after giving effect to the exchange ratio in the Merger. The convertible notes issued by Msystems Finance Inc. will become convertible into shares of SanDisk common stock, after giving effect to the exchange ratio in the Merger.
     The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants of SanDisk and msystems, including, among others, a covenant by msystems to conduct its business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and consummation of the Merger and not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period. The board of directors of msystems has adopted a resolution recommending the requisite approval of the Merger by its shareholders, and has agreed to hold a shareholder and any necessary creditor meetings to consider and vote upon the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. msystems has also agreed not to (i) solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions or an agreement concerning or provide confidential information in connection with any proposals for alternative business combination transactions.
     Consummation of the Merger is subject to conditions, including, among others, (i) approval of the Merger by an Israeli court, (ii) receipt of certain regulatory approvals, (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the closing, (iv) subject to an overall material adverse effect qualification on most representations and warranties, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party at the time of execution of the Merger Agreement, and (iv) subject to an exception for any unintentional breaches, compliance in all material respects by the other party with its covenants.
     The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both SanDisk and msystems and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, msystems may be required to pay SanDisk a termination fee of $74.0 million.
     The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of each of SanDisk and msystems . The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the Merger Agreement and are subject to qualifications and limitations agreed to by the respective parties in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, certain representations and warranties were made as of a specific date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders, or may have been used for purposes of allocating risk between the respective parties rather than establishing matters of fact. Investors should read the Merger Agreement together with the other information concerning SanDisk and msystems that each company publicly files in reports and statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Table of Contents
     SanDisk will file the Merger Agreement and related agreements in a subsequent Current Report on Form 8-K. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated into this report by reference.
Voting Undertakings
     Concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, the directors and executive officers of msystems entered into a Voting Undertaking with SanDisk (the "Voting Undertakings") pursuant to which they agreed to vote their shares of msystems (i) for the adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger (the "Transactions"), (ii) against any action or agreement that would compete with, or materially impede, or interfere with or that would reasonably be expected to discourage the Transactions; or inhibit the timely consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) except for the Merger, against any alternative business combination transaction, or merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation or sale or transfer of any material assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries not permitted pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
     Pursuant to the Voting Undertakings, the signing shareholders also agreed that if msystems terminates the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, and such shareholders subsequently receive consideration for their msystems shares in an alternative business combination transaction, then the signing shareholders will pay to SanDisk 50% of the difference between the price they would have received in the Merger and the price they actually receive in the alternative transaction (which payment will take the same form as the consideration they receive in the alternative transaction).
Lock-Up Agreement
     Concurrently with execution of the Merger Agreement, the chief executive officer of msystems entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with SanDisk (the "Lock-Up Agreement") pursuant to which he agreed not to sell the SanDisk shares he receives as a result of the Merger for a period ending on the earlier of two years after the completion of the Merger or the time at which each of the chief executive officer and president of SanDisk are no longer employed by SanDisk, subject to the following exceptions:(i) he may sell 35% of the aggregate SanDisk shares he receives in the Merger immediately, and (ii) he may sell an additional 30% of the aggregate SanDisk shares he receives in the Merger after one year.
Affiliate Agreements
     Concurrently with execution of the Merger Agreement, certain affiliates of msystems entered into Affiliate Agreements (the "Affiliate Agreements") pursuant to which such affiliates agreed not to make any sale, transfer or other disposition of SanDisk securities that they receive as a result of the Merger in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Exhibit 99.1
The following joint press release was issued on July 30, 2006.
MILPITAS, Calif. & KFAR SABA, Israel- July 30, 2006SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) and msystems Ltd. (NASDAQ:FLSH) today entered into definitive agreements for SanDisk to acquire msystems in an all stock transaction. This combination joins together two flash memory pioneers with complementary products, customers and channels. Together the combined company will have the people, technology, manufacturing and IP to play a leading role in creating new markets and accelerating the penetration of flash memory into existing storage applications.
"SanDisk and msystems, over the past 18 years, have been leading innovators in the flash storage market. This strategic acquisition will give us the critical mass and complementary products, customers, channels, technology and manufacturing base to take our shared vision to the next level. The NAND flash data storage business is in its early stages and we believe the market opportunity is largely untapped," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk. "msystems is a leader in flash memory systems addressing mobile, portable and embedded markets and they have a strong team, significant IP and important OEM customers. SanDisk has a record of creating new market categories, world-class manufacturing capabilities and leading market share in the retail channel. Both companies are noted for their relentless innovation, and this acquisition is intended to further accelerate our pace of innovation. In the near term, this transaction better positions SanDisk to serve the expanding storage needs of handset manufacturers and mobile network operators. In the long term, the combination with msystems will be a catalyst in the development of next generation flash enabled consumer applications. We are extremely excited about joining forces with the msystems team to achieve our shared vision. We are committed to serving msystems' OEM customers after the transaction closes."
"From mDOC to megaSIM, from U3 to x4, msystems is creating new markets through innovation," said Dov Moran, President and Chief Executive Officer of msystems. "We are truly proud of our achievements to date. This strategic deal will enable us to continue supporting our OEM customers, to whom we remain fully committed, and strengthen our innovation and product offering with SanDisk's leading edge, low-cost fab capacity. This deal has synergy at its core, encompassing people, technology, products and customers. Based on our shared vision, as well as our teams' history of successful and fruitful cooperation, I am confident we can succeed in achieving the goals we set for ourselves. I also believe that SanDisk's extensive silicon expertise will prove itself as a strong catalyst to productizing our revolutionary x4 technology as well as other future innovations."
 
In the transaction, each msystems ordinary share will be converted into 0.76368 of a share of SanDisk common stock, representing a 26% premium over the average closing price of msystems' shares for the last thirty trading days. The closing of the transaction is subject to conditions, including, among others, Israeli court approval, regulatory approval and msystems shareholder approval. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In addition, msystems intends to release its second quarter 2006 financial results on Monday, August 7, 2006 during pre-market hours.

     (e) If shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.3 are to be issued in the name of a Person (as defined in Section 8.7(h)) other than the Person in whose name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons requesting such issuance will have paid to the Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.14(a)) required by reason of the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the reasonable

For each Company Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, to the Company's Knowledge, there has been no event, condition or circumstance that has adversely affected or is likely to adversely affect such qualified status, except such events, conditions or circumstances which could be corrected without the Company incurring a material liability. No Company Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract.
     (f) No Company Employee Plan provides, or reflects or represents any liability material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to provide post-termination life, health or other welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be required by Section 601 through 608 of ERISA or other applicable statute.
     (g) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate: (i) is not liable for any arrears of wages or penalties with respect thereto; and (ii) is not liable for any payment to any trust or other fund governed by or maintained by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice). Each current Employee who resides in the United States of America is an "at-will" employee.
     (h) No work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated. The Company does not know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize any Employees. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Employees and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.
     (i) Each International Employee Plan has been established, maintained and administered in material compliance with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all Legal Requirements that are applicable to such International Employee Plan. Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities, that as of the Effective Time, will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by Legal Requirement, no condition exists that would prevent the Surviving Company, its Subsidiaries or the Parent from terminating or amending any International Employee Plan at any time for any reason without liability to the Surviving Company or its ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary administration expenses or routine claims for benefits).
     (j) Solely with respect to Employees who reside or work in Israel ("Israeli Employees"): (i) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company is a party to any collective bargaining contract, collective labor agreement or other contract or
 
arrangement with a labor union, trade union or other organization or body involving any of its Israeli Employees. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has recognized or received a demand for recognition from any collective bargaining representative with respect to any of its Israeli Employees. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has or is subject to, and no Israeli Employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company benefits from, any extension order () or any contract or arrangement with respect to employment or termination thereof; (ii) all of the Israeli Employees are "at will" employees subject to the termination notice provisions included in Employment Agreements or applicable Legal Requirements; (iii) the Company's or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company's obligations to provide statutory severance pay to its Israeli Employees pursuant to the Severance Pay Law (5723-1963) (the "Severance Pay Law") have been satisfied or have fully funded by contributions to appropriate insurance funds or accrued on the Company's financial statements; and (iv) the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable legal requirements and contracts relating to employment, employment practices, wages, bonuses and other compensation matters and terms and conditions of employment related to its Israeli Employees, including The Prior Notice to the Employee Law 2002, The Notice to Employee (Terms of Employment) Law 2002, the Prevention of Sexual Harassment Law (5758-1998), and The Employment by Human Resource Contractors Law 1996. The Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company have not engaged any employees whose employment would require special Approvals, and there are no unwritten Company policies or customs which, by extension, could entitle Israeli Employees to benefits in addition to what they are entitled by law. "Israeli Employee" shall be construed to include consultants, sales agents and other independent contractors who would be deemed to be employees for purposes of Israeli labor laws. All of the Israeli Employees are terminable by the Company on 30 days notice or less.

Share Options, SARs and Employee Benefits
 
     (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Share Option and Company SAR under the Company Option Plans or under any agreement disclosed in Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Transaction be assumed by the Parent. Except as set forth in Section 5.10(e), each Company Share Option and Company SAR so assumed by the Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such options immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions and provisions regarding the acceleration of vesting on certain transactions), except that: (i) each Company Share Option will be solely exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Share Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Share Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company Share Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; (iii) each Company SAR will be solely exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) with respect to that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Shares that were subject to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (iv) the per share exercise price with respect to such assumed Company SAR will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per Company Share at which such Company SAR was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Parent shall comply with the terms of all such Company Share Options and Company SARs and use its reasonable best efforts to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Company Option Plans and permitted under the Code or other relevant Legal Requirements that any Company Share Options that qualified for tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time and that any Company Share Options that qualified for tax treatment under Section 102 of the Ordinance prior to the Effective Time continue to so qualify, with the same rights, after the Effective Time. The Parent shall take all corporate actions necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of all Company Share Options and Company SARs pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 5.10(a). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 5.10(a).
     (b) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all Company Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (the "401(k) Plans") unless the Parent provides notice to the Company that such 401(k) Plan(s) shall not be terminated. Prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall receive from the Company evidence that the 401(k) Plans have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the relevant entity's
 
board of directors (the form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of the Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.
     (c) On and for one year after the Effective Time, the Parent and/or any of the Parent's Subsidiaries shall arrange for each employee who resides in the United States of America and was participating in any of the Company Employee Plans immediately before the Effective Time, to participate in any counterpart benefit plans in the United States of America in which employees of the Parent participate (the "U.S. Counterpart Plans"), in accordance with the eligibility criteria thereof, : (i) such participants shall receive full credit for years of service with any one or more of the Company, any the Company Subsidiary and prior employers to the extent such service is taken into account under such the Company Employee Plans and to the extent such service credit does not result in the duplication of benefits and (ii) such participants shall participate in the U.S. Counterpart Plans on terms no less favorable than those offered by the Parent to its similarly situated employees. Provided that the Company or the applicable employee timely provides the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries with the information necessary to comply with this provision, the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries shall give credit under those of its U.S. Counterpart Plans that are welfare benefit plans for all amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by employees (in each case including their eligible dependents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in respect of the applicable plan year in which the Effective Time occurs. With respect to its medical plans, the Parent and/or its Subsidiaries shall waive all requirements for evidence of insurability and pre-existing conditions otherwise applicable to employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the U.S. Counterpart Plans in which employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries become eligible to participate on or following the Effective Time (to the extent that such conditions were covered under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may continue one or more of the Company Employee Plans, in which case the Parent and its Subsidiaries shall have satisfied their obligations hereunder with respect to the benefits so provided. Nothing in this Section 5.10(d) shall be construed to entitle any employee to continue his or her employment for any period of time or prevent the Parent from amending any of the U.S. Counterpart Plans or the Company employee benefit plans at any time; that no such amendment shall be made or given effect within one year after the Effective Time to the extent that such amendment would result in persons employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time having benefits, in the aggregate, that are less favorable than the benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of the Parent.
provided that
provided, however,
     (d) Without limiting the generality of Section 8.9(b), nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any rights or remedies on any employee, former employee, dependent or beneficiary.
     (e) (i) Effective on the Closing Date, the Company Share Options and Company SARs granted to individuals who are employees of the Company as of the
 
Closing Date ("Employee Holders") shall be amended to provide that during the two year period beginning on the Closing Date, the vesting of any and all such options shall accelerate to the extent set forth below upon (x) the involuntary termination of the employment of the Employee Holder, other than for Cause, by the Parent or (y) upon the voluntary termination of the employment of the Employee Holder due to Good Reason. "Cause" shall mean, as reasonably determined by the Parent based on the information available to it after due inquiry, (1) "Misconduct," as defined in the Parent's Amended and Restated 2005 Incentive Plan as in effect on the date hereof, or (2) the material failure of the Employee Holder to carry out the duties of his or her employment position, as determined pursuant to the performance standards generally applicable to, and in a manner not more stringent than generally applied to, employees of the Parent; provided that Cause shall not exist under clause (2) of this definition if the action(s) and/or omission(s) of the Employee Holder that would otherwise constitute Cause are curable in all material respects, unless the Employee Holder fails to cure such action(s) and omission(s) in all material respects within 30 days of receiving written notice from the Parent of its intent to terminate the employment of the Employee Holder for Cause absent such cure and specifying in reasonable detail the failures to comply deemed by Parent to constitute Cause. If requested by the Employee Holder, Parent will meet with the Employee Holder to discuss the failures to comply and curative actions. "Good Reason" shall mean, as reasonably determined by the Parent, the Employee's demotion, without the Employee's consent, to a job classification materially below the Employee's job classification prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that (i) Good Reason shall not be deemed to exist merely as a result of any changes to the Employee's title, authorities, or responsibilities occurring as a result of the Company becoming a business unit of Parent in the Merger, or (ii) any change to the Employee's title, authorities, or responsibilities that does not constitute a demotion according to the job classifications generally applicable to employees of Parent. The vested percentage of the Company Share Options and Company SARs of an Employee Holder who becomes entitled to such accelerated vesting shall be determined by (x) crediting such Employee Holder with two years of additional service if the termination of employment occurs during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, or (y) crediting such Employee Holder with one year of additional service if the termination of employment occurs during the period commencing on the day after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date.
               (ii) Notwithstanding Section 5.10(e)(i), effective on the Closing Date, the vesting of any and all Company Share Options and Company SARs held by the individuals listed on Section 5.10(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter will vest in accordance with the provisions set forth on such Section 5.10(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure.

     Section 7.2 .
Investment
     (a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or the Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(e) as a result of Parent's breach of Section 5.8, and, in either case, at the time of such termination the condition set forth in Section 6.1(c), to the extent relating to any Antitrust Laws, shall not have been satisfied (but all other conditions to the Parent's obligation to close the Transactions pursuant to Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than those by their nature that are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied), or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.1(c) (if the Restraint giving rise to the right to terminate relates to Antitrust Laws), then, at the Company's option (to be exercised in its sole discretion by delivery of written notice to Parent within ten Business Days of the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the provisions set forth in the foregoing clause (i) or (ii) (the "Investment Option Notice")), the Parent shall be obligated to make an investment in the Company (the "Investment"), and the Company shall be obligated to issue the Company Shares to Parent pursuant to the Investment, as follows. The "Investment" shall be the purchase by Parent from the Company of a number of Company Shares equal to up to 9.9% (which amount shall be determined by the Company in its sole discretion, and indicated in the Investment Option Notice) of the outstanding Company Shares on the date of such termination (the "Investment Shares") for a per share purchase price equal to the greater of (A) $38.15 and (B) the average closing price of one Company Share for the five consecutive trading days that the Company Shares have traded ending on and including the date of such termination as reported on Nasdaq (or other principal market on which the Company Shares are quoted and traded). Each of Parent and the Company agree to consummate the Investment at a closing (the "Investment Closing") to occur as promptly as practicable after delivery to the Parent of the Investment Option Notice. The place of any Investment Closing shall be at the offices of Parent, and the time of the Investment Closing shall be 10:00 a.m. (California Time). At the Investment Closing, Parent shall deliver cash in the aggregate amount set forth above, and simultaneously therewith the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate or certificates representing the Investment Shares, which shares shall be free and clear of all liens, claims, charges and encumbrances of any kind whatsoever (other than restrictions under securities Legal Requirements or restrictions under paragraph (b)). Each of Parent and the Company agrees to use
 
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with and provide information to the other, for the purpose of any required notice or application for approval to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Investment. Consummation of the Investment shall constitute conclusive evidence that this Agreement has been validly terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall be entitled to reduce, in its discretion, the number of Investment Shares to be purchased by the Parent.
     (b) With respect to the Investment Shares, the Parent shall not, for a period of two years after the Investment Closing (the "Lock-Up Period"), (i) directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell (including without limitation any short sale), pledge, transfer, establish an open "put equivalent position" within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(h) under the Exchange Act or otherwise dispose of any Investment Shares, (ii) publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing, or (iii) enter into any swap or other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic consequences of ownership of the Investment Shares, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of Investment Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise. After the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, except in connection with a sale pursuant to an effective registration statement, the Parent shall not (x) sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell (including without limitation any short sale) or transfer ("Transfer") to any Person (or to Persons who, to the knowledge of Parent, are acting as a "group" as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, but excluding in any case underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of Company Shares), in one or a series of transactions, an aggregate number of Company Shares equal to 4.9% of the outstanding Company Shares at the time of any such Transfer; or (y) Transfer Company Shares to any Person (excluding in any case underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide public offering of Company Shares) if, to the knowledge of the Parent after reasonable inquiry of the proposed transferee and doing a reasonable search of the SEC's EDGAR database, such Transfer would result in the transferee beneficially owning more than 4.9% of the outstanding Company Shares. With respect to the Investment Shares, the Parent hereby agrees, for so long as it owns any such shares, to vote the Investment Shares in the same proportion as the other shareholders of the Company vote on all matters that are presented to the shareholders of the Company for their approval. For the purpose of clarity, the Parent acknowledges that, with respect to the Investment Shares, the Parent will not be entitled to appoint any directors to the board of directors of the Company and the Parent will not be entitled to rights not generally available to the shareholders of the Company.
     (c) Until the expiration of the Lock-Up Period, neither the Parent nor any of the Parent's subsidiaries or representatives shall, without the prior written consent of the Company or its board of directors (or a duly empowered committee thereof): (i) acquire, publicly offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise any shares of any class of Voting Securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or other direct or indirect rights to acquire, any shares of any class of Voting Securities of the Company, or any assets of the Company or any subsidiary or division thereof; (ii) make, or in any way participate, directly or
 
indirectly, in any "solicitation" of "proxies" to vote (as such terms are used in the rules of the SEC), or seek to advise or influence any Person or entity with respect to the voting of any Voting Securities of the Company; (iii) make any public announcement with respect to, or publicly submit a proposal for or offer of (with or without conditions) any extraordinary transaction involving the Company or any of its securities or assets; (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, in connection with any of the foregoing; (v) otherwise publicly act or publicly seek to control or influence the management, board of directors or policies of the Company; or (vi) publicly request the Company or any of its representatives, directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the restrictions set forth in clauses (i) through (vi) of the foregoing sentence (collectively, the "Standstill Obligations") shall cease to apply in the event any Person or "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, unaffiliated with Parent, makes a bona fide, public, unsolicited proposal to acquire 40% or more of the outstanding Voting Securities of the Company; that the Standstill Obligations shall again apply in the event of the public withdrawal of such proposal; that nothing herein shall be construed to toll in any way the two-year Lock-Up Period during which the Standstill Obligations apply. "Voting Securities" shall mean at any time shares of any class of capital stock of the Company which are then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
provided
provided further
     (d) The Company's right to receive the Investment in the circumstances provided in paragraph (a) is the exclusive remedy available to the Company for any failure of the Merger and other Transactions to be consummated in those circumstances (regardless of whether the Company exercises its option to receive the Investment), and the Parent shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, except in the event of willful breach of this Agreement or pursuant to Section 8.11; that if the Parent fails to consummate the Investment as promptly as practicable after delivery of the Investment Option Notice, then the Parent shall (in addition to the Investment) pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with enforcing such obligation, together with interest on the amount of the Investment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

If this Agreement is terminated by either the Company or the Parent as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Parent or the Company, except (i) to the extent that such termination results from the willful breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 7.1,

Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") had previously reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 16, 2004 that on September 10, 2004, SanDisk and Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba") created Flash Partners, Ltd., a Japanese yugen kaisha, owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba, and agreed to cooperate in the construction and equipping of a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, Fab 3, in Yokkaichi, Japan to produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. The agreements governing the venture, including the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004, were filed with SanDisk's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2004.
     The total investment in Fab 3, excluding the cost of building construction, was estimated at $2.5 billion through the end of 2006, of which SanDisk's share was estimated to be approximately $1.25 billion. This investment was expected to generate approximately 37,500 wafers per month (subsequently expanded to 48,750 wafers per month), of which SanDisk's allocation is 50%.
     On February 14, 2006, SanDisk reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K that SanDisk and Toshiba had agreed on February 8, 2006 to accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 by increasing capacity from 48,750 wafers per month to 70,000 wafers per month by March 2007. The increase in wafer production was estimated to increase SanDisk's 50% investment in Fab 3 in the next 12 months by approximately $500 million, bringing SanDisk's total investment to approximately $1.6 billion.
     On May 3, 2006, SanDisk reported on its Current Report on Form 8-K that SanDisk and Toshiba had agreed on April 28, 2006 to further accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 to increase Fab 3 wafer capacity from 70,000 wafers per month to 90,000 wafers per month by April 2007. The incremental investment by SanDisk for 50% of this higher Fab 3 output was estimated at approximately $300 million over the next 12 months. SanDisk's total investment to bring Fab 3 wafer capacity to 90,000 wafers per month was expected to be approximately $1.9 billion.
     On July 27, 2006, SanDisk and Toshiba agreed to further accelerate the expansion of Fab 3 to increase Fab 3 wafer capacity from 90,000 wafers per month to 110,000 wafers per month by July 2007. The incremental investment by SanDisk for 50% of this higher Fab 3 output is currently estimated at approximately $350 million over the next 12 months. SanDisk's total investment to bring Fab 3 wafer capacity to 110,000 wafers per month is expected to be approximately $2.3 billion. SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.

On September 22, 2006, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the "Guarantee Agreement") with SMBC Leasing Company, Limited ("SMBC") and Toshiba Finance Corporation. Under this Guarantee Agreement, SanDisk will guarantee the payment obligations of Flash Partners Yugen Kaisha ("Flash Partners"), SanDisk's 49.9%-owned flash memory manufacturing company formed with Toshiba Corporation ("Toshiba"), to the Lessors (as defined below) concerning the SD Tranches (as described below) under a Master Lease Agreement for the lease of 98 billion of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to be installed in Fab 3 at Toshiba's Yokkaichi operations (the "Master Lease Agreement") dated as of September 22, 2006 among Flash Partners (the "Lessee"), SMBC, Toshiba Finance Corporation, Sumisho Lease Co., Ltd., Fuyo General Lease Co., Ltd., Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., STB Leasing Co., Ltd. and IBJ Leasing Co., Ltd. (collectively, the "Lessors"). Toshiba has entered into a similar guarantee agreement with Toshiba Finance Corporation, Sumisho Lease Co., Ltd., Fuyo General Lease Co., Ltd., Tokyo Leasing Co., Ltd., STB Leasing Co., Ltd. and IBJ Leasing Co., Ltd., as to which SanDisk has no additional guarantee obligations. The SD Tranches are approximately 49 billion (approximately $421 million based upon the exchange rate at September 22, 2006), and the Toshiba Tranches represent the remaining balance of such obligations of Flash Partners.
Under the Master Lease Agreement, Flash Partners will lease flash memory manufacturing equipment from the Lessors for a period of approximately four or five years, as specified in each drawdown under the Master Lease Agreement, and is obligated to make semi-annual lease payments. The Master Lease Agreement also provides Flash Partners with an option to purchase the leased equipment at fair market value at the time of purchase.
Additionally, the Lessors may terminate the Master Lease Agreement and accelerate all of Flash Partners' obligations under the Master Lease Agreement upon the occurrence of any of the following: (1) Flash Partners' failure to make payments under the Master Lease Agreement or related agreements, and the applicable payments are not made within two banking business days, or in respect of amounts other than lease payments, purchase option exercise costs, Return Adjustment Fees and stipulated damages, two banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (2) Flash Partners' failure to obtain and maintain required insurance over the leased equipment; (3) Flash Partners' failure to remove obligations in accordance with the Master Lease Agreement and failure to cure such action within five banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (4) Flash Partners' breach of any provision of any related agreement, which breach is not cured within 10 banking business days after receipt of written notice from the Lessors; (5) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba is subject to compulsory execution, petition for auction or disposition for failure to pay taxes and public dues, or a petition for the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings (including a petition for a similar procedure or disposition under foreign law) unless the relevant petition or disposition is

cancelled or dissolved within 30 calendar days; (6) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba discontinues all or a material part of its business, or adopts a resolution of dissolution without the approval of the Lessors; (7) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba assigns all or a material part of its business without the consent of the Lessors; (8) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba suspends payment, or any clearing bank undertakes procedures for suspension of transactions by Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba with banks and similar institutions; (9) if there is a change in the ownership interest ratio in Flash Partners directly or indirectly invested by each of Toshiba and SanDisk without the agreement of the Lessors; (10) if the Flash Partners Master Agreement dated September 10, 2004 among Toshiba, SanDisk and SanDisk (Cayman) Limited is cancelled, dissolved or terminated; (11) (i) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba suffers acceleration with respect to debt greater than $20 million arising from a default of monetary obligations, or (ii) if Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba suffers acceleration with respect to monetary obligations greater than $100 million, other than obligations in which the third-party creditor has explicitly or implicitly agreed or consented to the delinquency, including situations where there is implied consent pursuant to commercial practices, or cases in which Flash Partners, SanDisk or Toshiba are disputing the obligation and the dispute has not yet been settled; (12) if the total amount of equity on SanDisk's consolidated balance sheet as of any fiscal year end or the mid point of a fiscal year is less than $1.514 billion; or (13) if the long-term debt rating of SanDisk by Standard & Poor's Rating Services or Moody's Investors Service is decreased to below BB- or Ba3 respectively.
Upon the occurrence of any of these events, subject to any deemed cure events, the Lessors may, at their option, terminate the Master Lease Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to Flash Partners.
Upon any such default or termination, SanDisk will be jointly and severally liable with Flash Partners to the Lessors to the extent of the guarantee, without any obligation on the part of the Lessors to first exhaust any remedies they may have against Flash Partners, and the Lessors may demand in writing that SanDisk perform its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement within 20 business days of SanDisk's receipt of such written demand.
The foregoing summaries of the material terms of the Guarantee Agreement and the terms of the Master Lease Agreement that are material with respect to SanDisk's obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Guarantee Agreement and the Master Lease Agreement (as translated from its original text in Japanese), each of which will be filed as exhibits to SanDisk's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending October 1, 2006.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On October 19, 2006, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended October 1, 2006.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for stock compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor in January 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and stock based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
          Milpitas, CA, October 19, 2006  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the third quarter ended October 1, 2006. Total third quarter revenue increased 27% on a year-over-year basis to a record $751 million. Third quarter net income as reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $103 million, or $0.51 per diluted share.
          Excluding the impact of stock compensation expense and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and the related tax effects, third quarter non-GAAP net income grew 15% to $124 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, which compares to the third quarter 2005 GAAP net income of $107 million, or $0.55 per diluted share.
          "We are very pleased with our third quarter results," said Eli Harari, chairman and chief executive officer of SanDisk Corporation. "Demand for our mobile products continued to be strong in the fast growing mobile phone market and we are pleased with our flash audio player U.S retail market share gains in the third quarter. Despite a challenging pricing environment in the third quarter we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 21%, primarily due to our highly competitive product cost structure from our captive Flash business ventures in Japan. We expect to benefit in the fourth quarter from projected seasonally strong holiday sales of digital cameras, handsets, flash audio players, USB flash drives and gaming consoles and we now believe growth in our megabytes sold will be approximately 200% for 2006."

Forward-Looking Statements
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business prospects and outlook for the forth quarter of 2006, including anticipated increased demand for our products, market supply and demand, expected fabrication production schedules and scheduled appearances by our CEO and CFO that are based on our current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: slower than expected growth in market demand for our products or a slower adoption rate for these products in current and new markets that we are targeting, any interruption of or delay in supply from any of the semiconductor manufacturing or subcontracting facilities, including test and assembly facilities that supply products to us, slower than expected expansion of our global sales channels, fluctuations in operating results, unexpected yield variances related to our conversion to 70-nanometer NAND flash technology or the ramp-up of the 300mm flash fabrication facility, our inability to make additional planned smaller geometry conversions in a timely manner, future average selling price erosion that may be more severe than our expectations due to decreased demand or possible excess industry capacity of flash memory from ourselves as well as from existing suppliers or from new competitors, less than expected growth in the average megabyte capacity per card, price increases from non-captive flash memory sources and third-party subcontractors, higher than expected operating expenses, higher than anticipated capital equipment expenditures, adverse global economic and geo-political conditions, including adverse currency exchange rates and acts of terror and war, the timely development, internal qualification and customer acceptance of new
 
products that are based on 70-nanometer NAND technology, fluctuations in license and royalty revenues, business interruption due to earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, power outages or other natural disasters, particularly in areas in the Pacific Rim and Japan where we manufacture and assemble products, potential impact of high energy prices and other global events outside of our control which could adversely impact consumer confidence and hence reduce demand for our products, risks related to our potential acquisition of msystems, including that the acquisition may not be consummated in a timely manner or at all, that we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to integration challenges, the loss of customers, suppliers, distributors or other third parties or other issues, that we may incur substantial costs or other damages associated with pending or future litigation related to the merger or costs or damages related to msystems' prior stock option grant practices and that we may incur charges or other accounting changes as a result of the merger, the risk that scheduled appearances by our executives could be cancelled or delayed by us or the network, and the other risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Future results may differ materially from those previously reported. We do not intend to update the information contained in this release.

Section 2  Financial Information
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
     On November 19, 2006, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") dated July 30, 2006 by and among SanDisk Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("SanDisk"), Project Desert Ltd., an Israeli corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk ("Merger Sub") and msystems Ltd., an Israeli corporation ("msystems"), Merger Sub merged (the "Merger") with and into msystems, with msystems surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk.
     Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding ordinary share of msystems was exchanged for 0.76368 of a share of SanDisk common stock (the "Exchange Ratio"). SanDisk issued approximately 29 million shares of common stock to former msystems shareholders. Based on the closing price of $47.14 per share of SanDisk's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on November 17, 2006, the last trading day before the closing of the Merger, the aggregate value of the consideration paid to former msystems shareholders in connection with the Merger is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. With the close of the transaction, msystems, which traded under the symbol "FLSH", ceased to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant
     In connection with the Merger, SanDisk has entered into a supplemental indenture, dated as of November 19, 2006, to amend the March 2005 indenture among msystems, M-Systems Finance Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of msystems ("Mfinco"), and the trustee thereunder, pursuant to which Mfinco issued $75 million aggregate principal amount of 1.0% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2035 (the "Notes"). Under the supplemental indenture, SanDisk became the co-obligor under the Notes with Mfinco and entered into guarantees with respect to the obligations of each of msystems and Mfinco under the Notes. SanDisk also agreed that the Notes are now convertible into shares of SanDisk common stock by reference to the Exchange Ratio (an initial conversion rate of approximately 26.8302 shares of SanDisk common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on each March 15 and September 15. Holders of the Notes will have the ability to require us to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, on March 15 of each of 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (which would include certain acquisitions of our common stock by third parties), Holders of the Notes will have the ability to require us to repurchase the Notes for cash, in whole or in part, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. We have the right, upon the happening of certain circumstances, to redeem the Notes beginning March 15, 2008 until March 15, 2010, and to redeem the Notes without condition at any time after March 15, 2010, in each case in whole or in part at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the unpaid principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date.

This release, however, does not apply to any claims that cannot be released as a matter of applicable law.
Full and General Release.
     10. A "covenant not to sue" is a legal term which means you promise not to file a lawsuit in court. It is different from the General Release of claims contained in Paragraph 9 above.

You expressly waive any and all rights which you may have under the provisions of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code or any similar law. Section 1542 provides:
Release of Unknown Claims.
"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."
     12. Excluded from this Agreement are any claims or rights which cannot be waived by law, including the right to file a charge of discrimination with, or participate in an investigation conducted by, an administrative agency.

EXHIBIT 99.1
     On November 19, 2006, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") completed the acquisition of msystems Ltd. ("msystems") in a stock for stock transaction (the "Merger") announced on July 30, 2006. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based on the historical financial statements of SanDisk and msystems, after giving effect to the acquisition of msystems by SanDisk, using the purchase method of accounting and applying the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 and the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006 are presented as if the acquisition had occurred on January 3, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2006. You should read this information in conjunction with the:
     The pro forma information presented is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the Merger had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments only include those adjustments that are directly attributable to the transaction and that have a continuing impact to SanDisk. They are based upon currently available information and certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, or SFAS 141, , the total estimated purchase price, calculated as described in Note 1 to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, has been preliminarily allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. SanDisk's management has estimated the preliminary fair value of the intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values of long-term debt and unvested options and stock appreciation rights assumed were based on market prices as of November 17, 2006. Any differences between the fair value of the consideration issued and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill. Since these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the Merger, the actual amounts recorded for the Merger may differ materially from the information presented. These allocations are subject to change pending further review of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the impact of potential restructuring activities, deferred taxes and actual transaction costs.
Business Combinations
     The valuation associated with unvested options and stock appreciation rights held by msystems employees reflected herein was calculated at the closing date of the Merger and does not consider employee terminations that may occur as a result of restructuring activities, which may significantly affect the amount, timing and recognition of the unearned compensation. Based on the fair value of SanDisk common stock at November 17, 2006, the amount of the stock-based compensation charge SanDisk would record associated with msystems employees would be approximately $55 million over the remaining estimated life of the stock-based awards after the closing of the Merger.
 
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended October 1, 2006 has been derived from:
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006 has been derived from:

1. BASIS OF PRO FORMA PRESENTATION
     On November 19, 2006, SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") completed the acquisition of msystems Ltd. ("msystems") in a stock for stock transaction (the "Merger") whereby msystems became a wholly-owned subsidiary of SanDisk. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The total estimated purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion consists of SanDisk common stock valued at $1.4 billion, options and stock appreciation rights assumed with a fair value of $116 million and estimated direct transaction costs of $15 million.
     The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented to give effect to SanDisk's acquisition of msystems as if the transaction had been consummated on October 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is presented as if the transaction had been consummated on January 3, 2005. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet provides for the issuance of approximately 29.4 million shares of SanDisk common stock at an average market price of $46.48, based upon a fixed exchange ratio of 0.76368, for each msystems ordinary share outstanding as of November 19, 2006. Under the purchase method of accounting, the fair value of the total consideration was measured using an average of SanDisk's closing share prices beginning two days before and ending two days after July 30, 2006, the date on which the acquisition was agreed to and announced.
     Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each msystems stock option and stock appreciation right outstanding and unexercised as of November 19, 2006 was converted into a stock option and stock appreciation right to purchase SanDisk common stock. Based on msystems' stock options outstanding at November 19, 2006, SanDisk assumed msystems' options and stock appreciation rights to purchase approximately 5.4 million shares of SanDisk common stock. The fair value of options assumed was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model and a stock price of $46.48, which represents the average closing price of a share of SanDisk common stock from two trading days before to two trading days after the July 30, 2006 announcement date. The fair value of the assumed stock appreciation rights was determined using a lattice-binomial option pricing model.
     The total estimated purchase price of the Merger is as follows (in millions):
 
Preliminary Estimated Purchase Price Allocation
     The preliminary allocation of the total purchase price to msystems' tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on their estimated fair values. The fair values of long-term debt and unvested stock options and stock appreciation rights assumed were based on the closing market price as of November 17, 2006. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary. Adjustments to these estimates may be included in the final allocation of the purchase price of msystems, if the adjustment is determined within the purchase price allocation period (up to twelve months from the closing date). The excess of the purchase price over the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to goodwill. The final determination of the purchase price allocation will be based on the fair values of assets acquired, including the fair values of in-process research and development, other identifiable intangibles and the fair values of assets and liabilities assumed as of the date that the merger is consummated, which will among other items change the amount of goodwill. The total purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated as follows (in millions):
 
 
     We have estimated the fair value of certain tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Some of these estimates are subject to change, particularly those estimates relating to potential restructuring activities, deferred taxes and actual transaction costs. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to updated valuations and further review by management, which may result in material adjustments.
Identifiable intangible assets
     We have estimated the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets, which are subject to amortization, using the income approach. These estimates are based on a preliminary valuation and are subject to updated valuations and further review by management, particularly those estimates relating to supply agreements, which may result in material adjustments. The following table sets forth the components of these other intangible assets and their weighted average estimated useful lives (dollars in millions):
2. PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
     The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet:
(a) To eliminate disallowed deferred revenue that would have been recognized in the income statement had the acquisition occurred in the beginning of fiscal 2005.
(b) Adjustments to cost of sales (in millions):
 
(c) To record incremental expense related to msystems unvested options and stock appreciation rights assumed.
(d) Adjustments to sales and marketing (in millions):
(e) To eliminate msystems' in-process research and development write-off related to prior acquisitions.
(f) To record amortization of identifiable acquired intangibles of msystems related to customer relationships, backlog and trade names.
(g) To eliminate equity losses from SanDisk's minority interest in U3 LLC.
(h) To eliminate msystems' equity losses from U3 LLC.
(i) The pro forma number of shares used in the per share calculations reflects the weighted average number of msystems' ordinary shares combined with the outstanding shares of SanDisk common stock at November 19, 2006, adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of 0.76368 shares of SanDisk common stock for each outstanding msystems' ordinary share. Additionally, the msystems 1% Convertible Senior Notes due 2035 (the "Notes") had a dilutive impact on the calculation of the weighted average shares outstanding for the period in the pro forma net income per share.
(j) To record fair value adjustments for investments and fixed assets acquired from msystems.
(k) To adjust msystems' deferred revenue to fair value, representing only the legal performance obligation under mystems' existing contracts.
(l) Adjustments to inventory (in millions):
(m) To record fair value of short-term receivables.
(n) Adjustments to goodwill (in millions):
(o) Adjustments to intangibles (in millions):
 
(p) Adjustments to other non-current assets (in millions):
(q) To record the accrual of direct acquisition-related costs.
(r) To adjust msystems' Notes to fair value.
(s) Adjustments to other non-current liabilities (in millions):
(t) Adjustments to stockholders' equity (in millions):

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On January 30, 2007, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for stock compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and stock based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Milpitas, CA, January 30, 2007  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. The Company's fourth quarter results reflect the recent acquisition of msystems Ltd., or msystems, that closed on November 19, 2006, and are compared to pre-acquisition results from prior reporting periods. Fourth quarter revenue increased 55% on a year-over-year basis to a record $1.164 billion, including $115 million of revenue from msystems. Standalone SanDisk fourth quarter revenue was $1.048 billion and increased 40% on a year-over-year basis. Fourth quarter net loss as reported on a consolidated basis and in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $35 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, (including a charge of $186 million for the write-off of acquired in-process technology, $31 million for share-based compensation expenses, $20 million for other acquisition-related charges and a $10 million reduction in income taxes related to these items) compared to net income of $134 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005.
TM
Total revenue for fiscal 2006 was $3.258 billion, up 41% from $2.306 billion in 2005. Standalone SanDisk total revenue was $3.142 billion and increased 36% for the year. Consolidated net income was $199 million, or $0.96 per diluted share (including a charge of $226 million for the write-off of acquired in-process technology, $101 million for share-based compensation expenses, $32 million for other acquisition-related charges and a $35 million reduction in income taxes related to these items) compared to net income of $386 million, or $2.00 per diluted share in 2005.
"The seasonally strong fourth quarter was our first ever billion dollar quarter, completing a year of excellent growth in revenue, standalone SanDisk profit and market share," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO of SanDisk. "In Q4 we experienced excellent sales across the board, in both the retail and OEM channels, and spanning across our consumer cards, mobile cards, MP3 players and USB flash drives. I am pleased with the very strong execution by our operations and supply chain resulting in a 73% sequential increase in megabytes sold and a strong non-GAAP operating margin for the SanDisk standalone business, due in large part to our continuing focus on cost reductions."
"In the first quarter of 2007 we expect continuing robust demand for our mobile OEM products, seasonally lower retail sales, and a decline in margins due to the prevailing challenging market pricing for flash memory. Internally we are focused on executing the integration of msystems and driving continued cost reductions by commencing the transition of our captive production from 70-nanometer to 56-nanometer NAND MLC in the first quarter. In early January, we unveiled exciting new products for new markets: SSD (for notebook PCs),
 
ReadyBoost flashdrives (for Microsoft Vista), Sansa View (our first flash Personal Video Player), Sansa Connect (for Wi-Fi content sharing) and USBTV (a revolutionary new product bridging PC and TV). We believe these products will fuel new demand later this year," Harari concluded.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
     On February 15, 2007, the Board of Directors of SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") approved a plan (the "Plan") to reduce operating costs, which includes a worldwide reduction in force of up to 10% of SanDisk's headcount, or approximately 250 employees. SanDisk expects to incur a restructuring charge in connection with the Plan in the range of $15 million to $20 million, with the majority of the expense occurring in the first quarter of 2007. Cash payments associated with the Plan will be approximately half of the total restructuring charge, with the remainder comprised of share-based compensation charges resulting primarily from acceleration of certain equity awards as per terms of the msystems acquisition. The workforce reduction will impact functions related to operations, engineering, sales and marketing and administration within SanDisk, and will primarily be based in the United States and Israel, and to a lesser degree, other international locations. The Plan is expected to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Total annualized operating cash cost savings related to the reduction-in-force and other cost saving measures, excluding severance costs, are expected to be approximately $30 million to $35 million, including cash savings from the reduction-in-force of approximately $20 million to $25 million. In addition, the reduction-in-force is expected to result in a decrease in share-based compensation expense of approximately $10 million on an annualized basis.
Safe Harbor Statement
     This report contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding the expected restructuring charges and future cash expenditures under, and anticipated timing of, the Plan, and anticipated cash and share-based compensation cost savings from the Plan. All forward-looking statements are based on management's estimates, projections and assumptions as of the date hereof and include the assumptions that underlie such statements. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including but not limited to the risks that SanDisk may incur charges and cash expenditures in connection with the Plan that are higher than anticipated or in other fiscal periods than anticipated, the Plan will not strengthen SanDisk's profitability, SanDisk will not achieve anticipated cost savings due to increased expenses in other areas of its business, the Plan will make it more difficult to integrate the operations and personnel of the former msystems Ltd., and therefore to achieve the intended benefits of such acquisition, due to loss of personnel or a decline in morale among former msystems Ltd. employees or the employees of the combined company, and the other risks described under the caption "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in SanDisk's SEC filings. SanDisk undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
SanDisk Corporation 601 McCarthy Boulevard Milpitas, CA 95035-7932 Phone: 408-801-1000 Fax: 408-801-8657
Milpitas, CA, April 26, 2007  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2007. First quarter revenue increased 26% on a year-over-year basis to $786 million and the net loss in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $0.6 million, or $0.00 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $35 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2006.
Excluding the impact of acquisition related charges, stock compensation expense and the related tax effect, first quarter non-GAAP net income was $45 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to first quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $90 million, or $0.44 per share.
"First quarter results reflected the current difficult market conditions," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "In the first quarter our industry experienced excess supply, sharp price declines, and depressed margins. These market conditions were exacerbated by weak seasonal consumer demand in retail. One highlight for the quarter was that the mobile market became our largest revenue generator with 27 million units sold in the quarter. Another highlight was the signing of an important licensing agreement with Hynix, which again validates our strong intellectual property portfolio. In another important milestone for our flash technology, this week Dell announced the launch of notebook PCs that incorporate our 32-gigabyte Solid State Drive (SSD)."
"Looking forward, we project a pick-up in demand during the seasonally strong back half of the second quarter. However, excess supply and depressed pricing is expected to continue through the second quarter, possibly extending through the summer months, putting pressure on our margins. Our outlook is optimistic for renewed growth heading into the fourth quarter of 2007
 
and forward to 2008. This optimism is based on our expectation of continuing penetration into multimedia handsets, the steady stream of exciting new consumer product introductions such as the Sansa Connect, and the exceptionally attractive price points for our products now available to consumers."

Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SanDisk Corporation

Milpitas, CA 95035-7932
Phone: 408-801-1000
Fax: 408-801-8657
Milpitas, CA, July 19, 2007  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended July 1, 2007. Second quarter revenue increased 15% on a year-over-year basis to $827 million and net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $96 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, stock compensation expense and the related tax effect, second quarter non-GAAP net income was $72 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2006 non-GAAP net income of $118 million, or $0.58 per diluted share.
"Demand for our products in the retail channel recovered nicely in the second quarter, resulting in record megabyte sales. In particular, SanDisk's growing strength in Europe and other international markets doubled our international unit sales compared to last year," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "Product gross margins stabilized despite substantial price reductions in the second quarter. We expect product gross margins to improve gradually in the second half of the year, driven by more moderate price declines resulting from an expected improvement in the balance between demand and supply, declining manufacturing costs and strength in our income from royalties. The flurry of new Flash memory enabled, highly innovative consumer and mobile products coming from our customers, our competitors, and ourselves, we believe, will fuel strong demand for our products in the second half of 2007 and in 2008. Our strategic investments in leading edge technology and IP, captive low-cost manufacturing capacity, product innovation and global retail channels position us exceptionally well to profit in the expected industry growth cycle."

Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Section 12.
     At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting, business must be:
Section 13.
     (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors;
     (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of a majority of the total number of directors which the corporation would have if there were no vacancies (the "Whole Board"); or
     (c) otherwise properly be requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than eighty (80) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the meeting is not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders.

     (b) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such business,

     (e) such other information regarding each matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed, by the Board of Directors, and
     (f) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 12 of the bylaws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12 of the bylaws, and if he/she should so determine, he/she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 12.
     Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally. However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 80 days in advance of such meeting; provided however, that in the event that the date of the meeting was not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than 90 days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders. Each such notice shall set forth:
Section 14.
     (a) The name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons to be nominated;
     (b) A representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors on the date of such notice and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice;
     (c) A description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder;
     (d) Such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors; and
     (e) The consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected.
     The number of directors which shall constitute the whole board shall be eight (8). Each director shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III, and shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified.
Section 1.
     Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except that in the event a director is removed by the stockholders for cause, the stockholders shall be entitled to fill the vacancy created as a result of such removal. The directors so chosen shall serve for the remainder of the term of the vacated directorships being filled and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.
Section 2.
 
     The business of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.
Section 3.
     The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of Delaware.
Section 4.
     The first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected Board of Directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
Section 5.
     Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
Section 6.
     Special meetings of the board may be called by the chief executive officer, chairman or vice-chairman on five (5) days' notice to each director by mail or twenty-four (24) hours notice to each director either personally or by telephone, telegram or facsimile; special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the board consists of only one director, in which case special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of the sole director. A written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time of the meeting stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Section 7.
     At all meetings of the board a majority of the then existing directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.
Section 8.
     Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be presided over by the chairman of the board, if any, or in his or her absence by the vice-chairman, or if there is no vice-chairman, by the chief executive officer, or in their absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting.
Section 9.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
Section 10.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
Section 11.
     The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.
Section 12.
     In the absence of disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he/she or they constitute a quorum,
 
may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
     Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the certificate of incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the resolution or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
     Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors when required.
Section 13.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. Director compensation may include, among other things, payment of their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors, payment of a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or payment of a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Section 14.
     Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or bylaw, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Section 15.
     Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the certificate of incorporation or of these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director or stockholder, at his or her address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. Notice to directors may also be given personally or by telephone or telegram.
Section1.
     Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the certificate of incorporation or of these bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
Section 2.
     The Board of Directors shall designate certain officers of the corporation as executive officers of the corporation, and such executive officers shall include the president, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and such other officers as the Board of Directors may designate and may include the chairman or vice-chairman.

Section 2.
     The Board of Directors at its first meeting after each annual meeting of stockholders shall choose a president, a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer and such other executive officers as the board may elect.
Section 3.
     With respect to the non-executive offices established by the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors or, if so delegated to the chief executive officer, the chief executive officer, may appoint such other non-executive officers, who shall hold their offices for such terms and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the chief executive officer.
Section 4.
     The compensation of all the executive officers of the corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors, and the salaries of all the non-executive officers of the corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors or, if so delegated by the Board, by the chief executive officer.
Section 5.
     The officers of the corporation shall hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Any officer elected or appointed by the Board of Directors may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. Any non-executive officer appointed by the chief executive officer may be removed at any time by such person. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the corporation appointed by the Board of Directors shall be filled by the Board of Directors, and any vacancy occurring in any non-executive office of the corporation appointed by the chief executive officer shall be filled by the Board of Directors or by the chief executive officer.
Section 6.
     The chairman of the board, if any, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and of the stockholders at which he/she shall be present. He/she shall have and may exercise such powers as are, from time to time, assigned to him/her by the Board and as may be provided by law.

     The corporation shall indemnify its officers and directors to the full extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact such person is or was an agent of the corporation. Reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he/she is or was a director or officer of the corporation (or was serving at the corporation's request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of a statement from such director or officer requesting such advance and an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he/she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized by relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

     The corporation shall have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (in addition to directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, or (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII, Section 6 by the stockholders of the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

     The foregoing rights of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled apart from the provisions of this Article VII.
     The chairman of the board, the president, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, or any other person authorized by the Board of Directors is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority granted herein may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
Section 7.
     These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, when such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the certificate of incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws be contained in the notice of such special meeting.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On August 31, 2007, SanDisk Corporation (the "Company") and 23 other companies were sued in the United States District Court of the Northern District of California in a purported consumer class action captioned Stuart Go et al. v. Lexar Media, Inc. et al., Civil Case No. 07-cv-04547-VRW, alleging a conspiracy to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize the pricing of flash memory, and concealment thereof, in violation of state and federal laws. The lawsuit purports to be on behalf of a class of purchasers of flash memory. The lawsuit seeks restitution, injunction and damages, including treble damages, in an unspecified amount.
     This week the Company and its Chief Executive Officer received grand jury subpoenas issued from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California indicating a Department of Justice investigation into possible antitrust violations in the NAND flash memory industry. The Company also received a notice from the Canadian Competition Bureau that the Bureau has commenced an industry-wide investigation with respect to alleged anti-competitive activity regarding the conduct of companies engaged in the supply of NAND flash memory chips to Canada and requesting that the Company preserve any records relevant to such investigation. The Company intends to cooperate in these investigations.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On October 18, 2007, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2007.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are one of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation that do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology that do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Milpitas, CA, October 18, 2007  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007. Third quarter revenue increased 38% on a year-over-year basis to $1.037 billion and net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) increased to $85 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP net income was $103 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2006.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, stock compensation expense and the related tax effect, third quarter non-GAAP net income increased to $130 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to second quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $72 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $124 million, or $0.61 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006.
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Demand was exceptionally strong in international retail, following our strategy to aggressively expand our business outside of North America. In the mobile phone market we sold a record 42 million units, reinforcing the enormous global opportunity which is unfolding. USB revenues also contributed
 
significantly to our growth in the quarter," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "Gross margins and the pricing environment improved substantially and excellent execution at Fab 3 allowed us to respond to the surge in customer demand. We expect demand to remain strong through the fourth quarter holiday season although we may not be able to meet 100% of the demand."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On April 17, 2008, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its first quarter ended March 30, 2008.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and msystems Ltd. in November 2006, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
SanDisk Corporation 601 McCarthy Boulevard Milpitas, CA 95035-7932 Phone: 408-801-1000 Fax: 408-801-8657
Milpitas, CA, April 17, 2008  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2008. Total first-quarter revenue increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $850 million and net income, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was $18 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense and the related tax effect, first quarter non-GAAP net income increased to $48 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $45 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.
"Product sales were solid on the strength of our international business, Sansa MP3 players and sales to the mobile handset and GPS markets. Pricing was challenging throughout the quarter due to industry-wide excess supply which adversely impacted our product gross margin," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "We expect demand to increase seasonally during the second quarter and price declines to moderate; however, product margins are expected to continue to be under pressure in Q2 with the anticipated benefit of low cost 43-nanometer and 3-bits per cell coming in the second half of the year. We are focused on cost controls and expense reductions and we continue to believe that the cumulative impact of price declines in recent quarters will accelerate the creation of new markets for Flash storage."

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On July 21, 2008, SanDisk Corporation (the "Registrant") issued a press release to report its financial results for its second quarter ended June 29, 2008.
     The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology do not reflect the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
     The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be "furnished" and therefore shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Exhibit 99.1
SanDisk Corporation 601 McCarthy Boulevard Milpitas, CA 95035-7932 Phone: 408-801-1000 Fax: 408-801-8657
Milpitas, CA, July 21, 2008  SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 29, 2008, as well as steps to slow its supply growth. Total second-quarter revenue was $816 million, a decrease of 1% on a year-over-year basis. Net loss in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) was ($68) million, or ($0.30) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007.
Excluding the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense and the related tax effect, the second quarter non-GAAP net loss was ($22) million, or ($0.10) per diluted share, compared to the second quarter 2007 non-GAAP net income of $72 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.
SanDisk is delaying the start of the next phase of production ramp in Fab 4 and now expects it to start no sooner than April 2009. The company is also pushing out its decision to invest in Fab 5 until market conditions improve. These actions are aimed at reducing future capital expenditures and inventory growth in order to maintain a strong balance sheet.
"Our second quarter sales were well below our expectations due to the rapid deterioration in consumer confidence which impacted our sales in U.S. retail and to handset OEMs. Product gross margin was negatively impacted by the lower sales volume and a substantial inventory write-down," said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO. "Overall demand is expected to improve in the upcoming holiday season; however, industry-wide Flash inventories remain excessive and pricing and margins will therefore remain under pressure until supply and demand come into balance. We are taking significant actions to slow our captive supply growth, which will reduce
 
our capital expenditure commitments, and allow us to better manage our inventory. We are also continuing to improve our cost structure through transitions to 43-nanometer MLC and the industry's first commercialized 3-bits per cell NAND flash. While the industry downturn has been more pronounced and severe than expected, we are optimistic about our long-term renewed growth when the market rebounds."

Milpitas, CA, September 16, 2008  SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced that its Board of Directors confirmed that it received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (KSE: 005930) to acquire SanDisk for $26 per share in cash. After multiple meetings with Samsung since its original indication of interest in an acquisition, SanDisk's Board of Directors has deliberated on Samsung's proposal with advice from its financial and legal advisors, and on September 15, 2008, sent the enclosed letter to Samsung reflecting the board's unanimous conclusion that the proposal is inadequate in multiple respects and not in the best interests of SanDisk's stockholders. Samsung responded by reiterating its offer to SanDisk on September 16, 2008.
As stated in its letter to Samsung, SanDisk's Board of Directors concluded that, in its view, the proposal:
 
Eli Harari, Chairman of the Board of SanDisk and Chief Executive Officer commented, "We believe Samsung's proposal does not provide appropriate value to our stockholders and is opportunistically timed at the trough of an industry-wide downturn. In our view, this proposal fails to recognize the value of our patent portfolio, in particular to Samsung, our significant investments in our strategic partnerships, and our technology leadership in 3 and 4 bits per cell flash memory, advanced controllers and three dimensional (3D) semiconductor memory. We believe we have the strategy, execution record, innovation and financial resources to return to profitable growth and be the flash memory leader in new growth markets in mobile devices, solid state disk, and portable consumer electronics."
Irwin Federman, lead independent director of SanDisk commented, "We have been and remain willing to enter into good-faith discussions with Samsung. However, due to Samsung's unwillingness to meet fair and reasonable process conditions coupled with their desire to acquire SanDisk at a significant discount to our view of its intrinsic value, the Board believes that this proposal is not in the best interests of stockholders. Going forward, we remain committed to diligently executing against our existing business strategy and maximizing value for our stockholders."
This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval.
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisors to SanDisk's board of directors and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is acting as a legal advisor to the board of directors.
The text of the letter sent by Dr. Eli Harari to Dr. Yoon Woo Lee, Samsung's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, on September 15, 2008 is included below:
September 15, 2008
Yoon-Woo Lee, PhD Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd Samsung Main Building 250, 2-ga, Taepyeongno Jung-gu, Seoul 100-742
 
Republic of Korea
Dear Dr. Lee:
This letter confirms many of the points we raised when we met with you last week. We received your unsolicited, non-binding proposal dated August 9, 2008 to acquire SanDisk Corporation for $26 per share in cash. After a detailed review, with advice from our outside financial and legal advisors, our board of directors has unanimously concluded that your proposal significantly undervalues SanDisk given the longer-term prospects of our business and does not reflect the substantial synergies Samsung can obtain from the proposed acquisition. In addition, your proposal fails to provide adequate deal certainty, thereby exposing SanDisk and its stockholders to unacceptable risk. Finally, your approach raises the question of whether this action is simply an effort to gain leverage in the ongoing negotiations to renew our patent cross license agreement and evidences an unwillingness to engage in a process designed to legitimately protect SanDisk's stockholders' interests.
We acknowledge the interest that you have expressed in SanDisk over the past few months and, as expressed in the discussions we have had since May 2008, the SanDisk board of directors remains open-minded about a transaction that appropriately addresses the issues of value, deal certainty and process. However, for these and other reasons we believe your proposal is not consistent with the SanDisk board of directors' objective of maximizing stockholder value and is not in the best interests of SanDisk's stockholders.
VALUE
While you emphasized that your offer is a premium of 56% over the stock price on the date of your non-binding proposal, in our meeting on May 22, 2008 you implied that Samsung was prepared to pay a significant cash premium over the then $28.75 price of SanDisk's shares. Today, SanDisk's share price is close to its lowest price in five years, and your offer represents a 55% discount to the 52-week high. SanDisk's stock price is significantly depressed at this time given industry cyclicality, the uncertainty resulting from our unresolved patent cross license agreement renewal with you and general equity market conditions, and therefore does not reflect the intrinsic value of SanDisk's business.
The flash memory business is a cyclical growth market, which is characterized by periods of strong growth and profitability such as we saw between 2002 and 2007, punctuated by periods of oversupply and declining flash prices like those we are experiencing today. Our board of directors is focused on creating long-term value for our stockholders and believes that SanDisk has the right strategy and the requisite financial resources to manage through a prolonged downturn and emerge as a stronger competitor. We are taking appropriate actions to further fortify our financial position and are confident that in the longer term we will benefit when exciting new flash applications, such as storage in multimedia handsets, flash solid state drives, and new consumer portable applications fuel the next period of industry profitability and growth.
You have described on numerous occasions the significant synergies that Samsung will achieve from acquiring SanDisk, one of the reasons why we believe you were willing to pay a significant premium over the $28.75 share price on May 22, 2008. Nothing has materially changed since that date in terms of the synergies Samsung can realize from acquiring SanDisk. These include avoiding billions of dollars of royalties over the coming decade; gaining access to our x3 (three
 
bits per cell) and x4 (four bits per cell) knowhow; owning our advanced controller technology; owning all of the leading card formats; gaining control of our revolutionary 3D (three dimensional rewritable semiconductor memory) technology  the best candidate to replace NAND flash in the coming decade; controlling our strong brand, broad retail distribution and leading market share in flash cards worldwide; and other cost and revenue synergies.
We also note that the run rate of Samsung's royalties to SanDisk continues to grow. Our view remains that without the right to use SanDisk's patents, Samsung's stand-alone NAND business' prospects would be significantly compromised. Conversely, ownership of our fundamental patent portfolio would greatly strengthen your patent position in emerging markets for flash storage like SSDs and managed NAND chipsets. We hope that your current offer is not an attempt to capitalize on the uncertainty reflected in our share price while this IP issue remains unresolved or a negotiating tactic in the licensing negotiations. SanDisk's stockholders deserve to be fairly compensated for the value SanDisk offers Samsung, and your current offer fails to recognize and monetize this value.
DEAL CERTAINTY
From the outset, we have expressed to you our concerns about the risks to SanDisk of moving forward with a transaction with Samsung if an announced transaction does not close. We note that any transaction between SanDisk and Samsung will be subject to regulatory review, including in the United States and the European Union. In addition, any announcement of a transaction with you could also have a negative impact on our business due to various factors. The simple, but important, point is that without both maximum certainty of closing as well as a viable path for SanDisk to continue as an independent entity should the transaction not close despite your best efforts, your proposal creates unacceptable risks for our stockholders and is not in their best interests.
Because of this, we have proposed negotiating a replacement cross license and supply agreement, both of which would become effective in August 2009 if an announced transaction does not close. We have also requested that you commit to certain terms to ensure that a transaction has maximum certainty of closing. Despite our repeated requests Samsung has failed to address these legitimate concerns.
PROCESS
We have been clear that together with price, these critical issues of deal certainty and risk mitigation must be addressed before we provide you due diligence access to the highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that you have requested. We note that there are sizeable synergies in this transaction for Samsung, most of which you control and can determine without access to confidential information. In addition, given that Samsung operates in the same industry and that SanDisk is a public company, we are confident that Samsung possesses the necessary information to address the issues we have highlighted above prior to gaining access to confidential information. However, despite our many attempts, including those by our lead outside director, Mr. Irwin Federman, to communicate the importance of these process issues and offering a reasonable roadmap by which we both can address them, you have rejected our guidance and instead insisted on access to highly confidential information about SanDisk before these issues are resolved.
 
CONCLUSION
The members of the SanDisk board of directors have taken, and will continue to take, their responsibilities to SanDisk's stockholders extremely seriously. We remain committed to the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As Mr. Federman has said to you on multiple occasions, including in our recent meeting in Seoul, on September 11, 2008, the SanDisk board of directors is open minded about a transaction with Samsung if it represents a price that recognizes the long-term intrinsic value of SanDisk and the significant synergies that accrue to Samsung, provides deal certainty to SanDisk and can be conducted in a process that adequately protects the interests of SanDisk's stockholders. Samsung's current offer and approach falls well short on all counts. As such, we respectfully reject your proposal.
Very truly yours,
Eli Harari, PhD Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 20, 2008, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended September 28, 2008.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of product gross margin, operating income, net income and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R) effective January 2, 2006 and the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006, and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information as certain non-cash charges such as amortization of purchased intangibles and share-based compensation do not reflect the cash operating results of the business and certain one-time expenses such as write-off of acquired in-process technology do not reflect the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
(e)           Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
 
On November 10, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of SanDisk Corporation (the Company) approved certain amendments to (i) the Companys change of control agreements with each of its named executive officers and (ii) certain of the Companys outstanding option agreements with its named executive officers and certain of its directors.  The amendments are primarily technical changes intended to comply with Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A).  The Committee also approved an increase in the severance benefits provided to Sanjay Mehrotra, the Companys President and Chief Operating Officer, under his agreement as described below.  The following summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the forms of change of control benefits agreement and option agreement amendment, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
The change of control agreements have been amended to provide that cash severance benefits under the agreements will be paid only following the executives separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A and that such payments to executive officers may be subject to a six-month delay period if required under Section 409A.  The amendments also include technical changes in the timing of certain severance payments intended to comply with Section 409A.  The Committee also authorized the establishment by the Company of a trust, subject to the requirements of Section 409A and other applicable tax law, for purposes of holding the severance amounts that may become payable pursuant to the agreements.
 
In general, each of the change of control agreements provides that, if a change of control (as defined in the agreement) occurs, the executive will be treated as having completed one additional year of vesting service for purposes of the executives outstanding and unvested equity awards.  In addition, if the executives employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason (as those terms are defined in the agreement) within 12 months following a change of control of the Company, the executive will be entitled to a cash payment determined by multiplying a severance multiplier by the sum of (1) the executives annual base salary as of the Change of Control or termination of employment, whichever is greater, and (2) the executives target annual bonus for the year of termination.  The Committee approved an increase in the severance multiplier for Mr. Mehrotra from 1.0 to 1.5.  The severance multiplier will remain 2.0 for Eli Harari, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and 1.0 for each of the other named executive officers.  The agreements also provide for the executive to receive the following severance benefits: (i) for a period of 24 months following the termination date, continuation of the same or equivalent life, health and other insurance coverage for the executive and his or her spouse and eligible dependents as the coverage provided immediately prior to the change of control; (ii) full vesting of the executives equity awards to the extent outstanding on the termination date and not otherwise vested, with accelerated options to remain exercisable for 12 months following the termination date (subject to the maximum term of the option); (iii) for a period of 12 months following the termination, executive-level outplacement benefits; and (iv) in the event that the executives benefits are subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, a gross-up payment so that the net amount of such payment (after taxes) he or she receives is sufficient to pay the excise tax due.
 
In addition, the Committee approved amendments to certain outstanding stock options held by Dr. Harari, Mr. Mehrotra, Judy Bruner, the Companys Executive Vice President, Administration and Chief Financial Officer, and Yoram Cedar, Executive Vice President, Mobile Business Unit and Corporate Engineering, as well as certain outstanding options held by Irwin Federman, James D. Meindl, Michael Marks and Catherine P. Lego, members of the Companys Board of Directors.  The amendments eliminate a provision giving the optionholder the right to surrender his or her option for a cash payment if a hostile take-over (as that term is defined in the applicable option plan) of the Company occurs and are intended to help bring the options into compliance with Section 409A.
 
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(c) Exhibits
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

(f) Specified Employees.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i) as of the date of the Executives Separation from Service, the Executive shall not be entitled to any payment or benefit (i) pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (ii) with respect to any restricted stock unit that vests pursuant to Section 5.01(b) until the earlier of (1) the date which is six (6) months after the Executives Separation from Service for any reason other than death, or (2) the date of the Executives death.  Any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive upon or in the six (6) month period following the Executives Separation from Service that are not so paid by reason of this Section 5.01(f) shall be paid (without interest) on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months after the Executives Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as soon as practicable, and in all events within ten (10) business days, after the date of the Executives death).  The payment timing provisions of this Section 5.01(f) shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.  It is the intent of the parties that this Section 5.01(f) shall not be construed to require or permit a delay in the payment or provision of any benefit or reimbursement under this Agreement other than (x) the payment under Section 5.01(a), and (y) the payment with respect to any restricted stock unit that vests pursuant to Section 5.01(b).  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the parties intend that the equity vesting provided in Section 5.01(b) and the payment or provision of the benefits and reimbursements provided in Section 5.01(c) and Section 5.01(d) shall not be subject to the delay described in this Section 5.01(f).
(g) Any payment or reimbursement of expenses required to be made to the Executive pursuant to Section 5.01(c) or Section 5.01(d) shall be made promptly, and if the Executive is required under the terms of the applicable plan or program to request such payment or reimbursement, no more than ten (10) business days following the date of such request.  In order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that any payment or reimbursement of expenses made to the Executive pursuant to Section 5.01(c) or Section 5.01(d) is taxable to the Executive, any such payment or reimbursement shall be made to the Executive no later than the earlier of (i) the deadline set forth in the preceding sentence, or (ii) the last day of the Executives taxable year following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred.  The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to require or permit a delay in any such payment or reimbursement.  The Executives right to any such payment or reimbursement or any benefit pursuant to Section 5.01(c) or Section 5.01(d) is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit and the amount of such benefits that the Executive receives in one taxable year shall not affect the amount of such benefits that the Executive receives in any other taxable year.

6.              NO MITIGATION. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payments provided for by this Agreement by seeking employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any cash payments or benefits provided under this Agreement be reduced by any compensation or benefits earned by the Executive after his or her Date of Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Executive is entitled, by operation of any applicable law, to unemployment compensation benefits or benefits under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988 (known as the "WARN" Act) in connection with the termination of his or her employment in addition to amounts required to be paid to him or her under this Agreement, then to the extent permitted by applicable statutory law governing severance payments or notice of termination of employment, the Company shall be entitled to offset the amounts payable hereunder by the amounts of any such statutorily mandated payments.
7.              LIMITATION ON RIGHTS.
7.01 NO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. This Agreement shall not be deemed to create a contract of employment between the Company and the Executive and shall not create any right in the Executive to continue in the Company's employment for any specific period of time. This Agreement shall not restrict the right of the Company to terminate the employment of Executive for any reason, or no reason at all, or restrict the right of the Executive to terminate his or her employment.
7.02 NO OTHER EXCLUSIONS. This Agreement shall not be construed to exclude the Executive from participation in any other compensation or benefit programs in which he or she is specifically eligible to participate either prior to or following the Effective Date of this Agreement, or any such programs that generally are available to other executive personnel of the Company.

Any arbitration hereunder shall be in Santa Clara County, California before a sole arbitrator selected from Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc., or its successor ("JAMS"), or if JAMS is no longer able to supply the arbitrator, such arbitrator shall be selected from the American Arbitration Association, and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1280 et seq. as the exclusive forum for the resolution of such dispute.

The arbitrator shall resolve any dispute as to the reasonableness of any fee or cost.

(a) No right or interest to or in this Agreement, or any payment or benefit to the Executive under this Agreement shall be assignable by the Executive except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. No right, benefit or interest of the Executive hereunder shall be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge, hypothecation or set off in respect of any claim, debt or obligation, or to execution, attachment, levy or similar process or assignment by operation of law. Any attempt, voluntarily or involuntarily, to effect any action specified in the immediately preceding sentences shall, to the full extent permitted by law, be null, void and of no effect; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude the Executive from designating one or more beneficiaries to receive any amount that may be payable to the Executive under this Agreement after his or her death and shall not preclude the legal representatives of the Executive's estate from assigning any right hereunder to the person or persons entitled thereto under his or her will, or, in the case of intestacy, to the person or persons entitled thereto under the laws of intestacy applicable to his or her estate.

Exhibit 10.2
 
____________, 2008
 
_______________
_______________
_______________
 
Dear ___________:
 
As you may know, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A) imposes new requirements on a wide range of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements.  
Section 409A defines nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements broadly to include stock options and other equity-based awards that do not meet certain requirements set forth in the IRS regulations.  To the extent these awards had not vested as of December 31, 2004 when Section 409A went into effect, they may be subject to the requirements of Section 409A.  Failure to comply with Section 409A may result in severe penalties for you under the tax law.
 
The purpose of this letter agreement is to amend the agreements that evidence certain stock options granted to you by SanDisk Corporation (the Company) in a manner intended to comply with Section 409A.  Specifically, certain of your option grants include a limited stock appreciation right (the Limited SAR) that would allow you to surrender your option for a cash payment if a hostile take-over (as that term is defined in the applicable option plan) of the Company occurs.  The Limited SAR provision may cause your options to be treated as deferred compensation subject to Section 409A.
 
Below is a list of your outstanding option grants (your Outstanding Options) that include the Limited SAR provision and had not vested as of December 31, 2004:
 
By signing and returning this letter, you agree that, effective immediately, your Outstanding Options are amended so that the Limited SAR provision will not apply to the portion of your option that had not vested as of December 31, 2004.  This letter agreement does not modify any other terms of your Outstanding Options.  In other words, the existing vesting schedule and other provisions of your Outstanding Options will continue in effect.  This letter agreement also does not modify any portion of your Outstanding Options that had vested as of December 31, 2004.
 
This amendment is intended to help you avoid incurring tax penalties.  Please note that you remain solely liable for your own tax liability with respect to your Outstanding Options.
 
If this letter accurately sets forth our agreement with respect to the foregoing matters, please sign the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to me.  Please contact me at if you have any questions.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
 
 
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 2, 2009, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 28, 2008.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R), the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006, and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008 and the impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of purchased intangible assets, and share-based compensation, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
   
 
On January 29, 2009, SanDisk Corporation and several wholly owned SanDisk subsidiaries (collectively, SanDisk) entered into definitive agreements with Toshiba Corporation (Toshiba), under which SanDisk and Toshiba restructured two of their semiconductor manufacturing joint ventures, each of which equips and operates a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility, to provide for the acquisition by Toshiba of certain production capacity in connection with the production of NAND flash memory products at the facilities.  Flash Partners, Ltd., a Japanese formed in September 2004 (Flash Partners), owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba equips and operates a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility (Fab 3), located in Yokkaichi, Japan, to supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba.  Flash Alliance, Ltd., a Japanese (together with Flash Partners, the Joint Ventures)formed in July 2006, owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba equips and operates a 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facility (Fab 4), located in Yokkaichi, Japan, to supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba.

In connection with the restructuring, SanDisk and Toshiba entered into a Joint Venture Restructure Agreement and an Equipment Purchase Agreement, each dated as of January 29, 2009.  In addition, SanDisk and Toshiba entered into a Foundry Agreement, dated as of January 29, 2009 (the Foundry Agreement, together with the Joint Venture Restructure Agreement and the Equipment Purchase Agreement, the Agreements).  The Agreements amend the terms of the existing agreements governing each Joint Venture.
Joint Venture Restructure Agreement
The Joint Venture Restructure Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which each Joint Venture has agreed to sell to Toshiba more than 20% of its current production capacity through the acquisition by Toshiba of certain owned and leased equipment pursuant to the terms of an Equipment Purchase Agreement described below.  SanDisk and Toshiba will continue to be equal partners for the remaining capacity of each of the Joint Ventures.  The Joint Venture Restructure Agreement further provides that SanDisk retains the option to continue to invest on a fifty-fifty basis for all future expansions of NAND memory production capacity of Fab 3 and Fab 4.  In addition, the parties will continue their existing joint technology development in advanced NAND and 3D read/write memory.  The Joint Venture Restructure Agreement also containsstandard representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type.
 
Equipment Purchase Agreement
 
The Equipment Purchase Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Toshibas acquisition of the owned and leased equipment.  Of the equipment acquired by Toshiba from the Joint Ventures pursuant to the Agreements, (i) approximately 1/3 is owned equipment and will be paid for in cash by Toshiba and (ii) approximately 2/3 is leased by the Joint Ventures and the leases associated with that equipment will be transferred to Toshiba.  The total value of the restructuring transaction to SanDisk is approximately $890 million based on current exchange rates.  Upon the completion of each transfer of leased equipment, SanDisk will no longer provide a guarantee to the leasing company for the equipment transferred at that time.  Once completed, the transfer of the leased equipment reduces SanDisks outstanding lease obligations by approximately two-thirds of the total value of the restructuring transaction, representing approximately 28% of SanDisks total equipment lease obligations.  The Joint Ventures will use proceeds from the sale of the owned equipment in the transaction to repay certain loan obligations to each of SanDisk and Toshiba, resulting in SanDisk receiving approximately one-third of the total value of the restructuring transaction in cash, less various fees and costs to be borne by SanDisk that are associated with the transfer of the leased equipment to Toshiba.  These fees and costs include the interest rate spread between Toshibas rates and SanDisks rates for the leases assumed and guaranteed by Toshiba which were formerly guaranteed by SanDisk, and other costs, fees and expenses. The Equipment Purchase Agreement contemplates that the transfer of the leased equipment and the sale of the owned equipment will occur at several closings between January 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009 and that SanDisk will receive its portion of the purchase price for the owned equipment by late March 2009, subject to certain conditions and contingencies.  The closing of the sale of the leased and owned equipment is subject to certain negotiated terms and conditions described in the Agreements.
Foundry Agreement
Under the Foundry Agreement, SanDisk has the right to purchase certain NAND flash memory products manufactured by Toshiba using some portion of the capacity and equipment acquired by Toshiba under the Joint Venture Restructure Agreement and the Equipment Purchase Agreement.
The above descriptions of the material terms of the Joint Venture Restructure Agreement, the Equipment Purchase Agreement and the Foundry Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of these agreements, redacted versions of which SanDisk intends to file as exhibits to a future periodic report.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 21, 2009, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its first quarter ended March 29, 2009.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R), the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets and share-based compensation, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Milpitas, CA, April 21, 2009 - SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the world's largest supplier of flash storage card products, today announced results for the first quarter ended March 29, 2009.  Total revenue of $659 million declined 22% on a year-over-year basis.  Net loss, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), was ($208) million, or ($0.92) per share, compared to GAAP net income of $11 million or $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2008.
 
 
Non-GAAP net loss was ($108) million, or ($0.48) per share, compared to non-GAAP net profit of $48 million, or $0.21 per share, in the first quarter of 2008.  For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
 
Industry fundamentals improved in the first quarter.  We are encouraged that industry supply and demand balance is becoming better aligned, resulting in higher flash pricing.  Our financial results improved substantially from the prior quarter driven by better than expected demand, strong product cost reductions and lower operating expenses, said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO, SanDisk.  We completed the previously announced restructuring of the Manufacturing Joint Ventures with Toshiba, which substantially improves our financial position by bringing in cash and reducing our equipment lease obligations.  Our outlook is cautiously optimistic for continued improvement in the second quarter.

SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. announced today that they signed a definitive agreement to renew the cross license of their semiconductor patent portfolios. In addition, the companies signed a flash memory supply agreement under which Samsung will continue to make available to SanDisk a guaranteed portion of its flash memory production output. The new agreements become effective when the current cross license and supply agreements expire on August 14, 2009, and will run for seven years from that date.
MILPITAS, CALIFORNIA and SEOUL, KOREA, MAY 27, 2009
The new patent cross-license agreement includes rights to each party's patents broadly covering multi-level cell flash memory and flash storage systems, but does not license either party's patent claims specific to 3-D memory technology. Over the life of the new license, the estimated effective rate of the fixed payments and royalties is expected to be approximately half of the effective rate in recent years under the current license. Financial terms of the agreements were not disclosed.
"We are very pleased with the agreements announced today. We believe that they represent good value for our stockholders and enable both parties to focus on the growth markets at hand. We are excited about our opportunities in mobile, computing and consumer flash storage markets. Furthermore, continued access to Samsung's flash capacity under competitive terms gives us greater flexibility in managing our future capital expenditures for captive capacity. We look forward to a constructive relationship with Samsung in the years ahead." said Dr. Eli Harari, chairman and chief executive officer, SanDisk.
"The renewal agreements enable Samsung and SanDisk to each focus their energies on restoring flash market growth. It is clear that these renewal agreements are aimed at strengthening the on-going business relationship between Samsung and SanDisk, and we are pleased that the two companies have worked hard to achieve a significantly improved balance on the patent license." said Dr. Oh-Hyun Kwon, president of the Semiconductor Business, Samsung Electronics.

SanDisk's Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about expectations regarding the benefits of the renewal license agreement, the expected effective royalty rates thereunder, market opportunities for flash memory including mobile, computing and consumer flash storage markets, and the expected benefits of the flash memory supply agreement that are based on SanDisk's current expectations and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others: Samsung's failure to perform its obligations under the license or supply agreement, the size and growth rate of Samsung's flash memory business, slower than expected, or no, growth in market demand for flash memory products in current and new markets, SanDisk's ability to reduce its captive supply capital expenditure requirements due to the supply agreement with Samsung, whether the pricing terms under the supply agreement result in cost-competitive supply as compared to other captive and non-captive sources, and other risks detailed from time-to-time in SanDisk's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, under the caption "Risk factors" and elsewhere in SanDisk's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and SanDisk's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

For purposes of this Section 11, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to that director.
Section 11.
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
Section 12.
At any meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before a meeting, business must be:

For business to be properly requested to be brought before any meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than eighty (80) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the meeting is not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders.

(f) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 of the bylaws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13 of the bylaws, and if he/she should so determine, he/she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally. However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholder's intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 80 days in advance of such meeting; provided however, that in the event that the date of the meeting was not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than 90 days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders. Each such notice shall set forth:

The directors so chosen shall serve for the remainder of the term of the vacated directorships being filled and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.
Section 2.

A written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time of the meeting stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Section 7.
At all meetings of the board a majority of the then existing directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation.

Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
Section 11.
The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.

Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the certificate of incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the resolution or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock.

The books of account shall at all reasonable times be open to inspection by any director.
Section 14.
The chief financial officer shall deposit all money and other valuables in the name and to the credit of the corporation with such depositaries as may be designated by the Board of Directors. He/she shall disburse the funds of the corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors, shall render to the president, the chief executive officer and directors, whenever they request it, an account of all of his or her transactions as chief financial officer and of the financial condition of the corporation, and shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or these bylaws.

Section 16.
the duties of his or her office and for the restoration to the corporation, in case of his or her death, resignation, retirement or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in his or her possession or under his or her control belonging to the corporation.
The treasurer, controller and the other assistants to the chief financial officer in the order determined by the Board of Directors or the chief executive officer (or if there be no such determinations then in the order of their election) shall, in the absence of the chief financial officer or in the event of his or her inability or refusal to act, perform the duties and exercise the powers of the chief financial officer and shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors or the chief executive officer may from time to time prescribe.
Section 17.
The corporation's stock may be certificated or uncertificated as provided under Delaware law, and shall be entered in the books of the corporation and registered as shares are issued. Every holder of stock in the corporation represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate, signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board of Directors, or the president or a vice-president and the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation, representing the number of shares registered in certificate form in the name of the holder.
Section 1.
Certificates may be issued for partly paid shares and in such case upon the face or back of the certificates issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor, and the amount paid thereon shall be specified.
If the corporation shall be authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualification, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights for certificated shares shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as otherwise provided in section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated on certificates pursuant to section 151, 156, 202(a) or 218(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, the rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated stock and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing stock of the same class and series shall be identical.
Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he/she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Section 2.
The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or certificates of stock or uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates of stock or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give the corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Section 3.
Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to either issue a new certificate or provide evidence of the issuance of uncertificated shares to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
Section 4.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting: provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 5.
The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
Section 6.
Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation.
Section 1.
Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purposes as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
Section 2.
All checks or demands for money and notes of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.
Section 3.
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 4.
The Board of Directors may adopt a corporate seal having inscribed thereon the name of the corporation, the year of its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware". The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
Section 5.
The corporation shall indemnify its officers and directors to the full extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding arising by reason of the fact such person is or was an agent of the corporation. Reasonable expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he/she is or was a director or officer of the corporation (or was serving at the corporation's request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of a statement from such director or officer requesting such advance and an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he/she is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized by relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
Section 6.
The corporation shall have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (in addition to directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, or (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.
A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is hereafter amended to authorize, with the approval of a corporation's stockholders, further reductions in the liability of the corporation's directors for breach of fiduciary duty, then a director of the corporation shall not be liable for any such breach to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article VII, Section 6 by the stockholders of the corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him/her and incurred by him/her in any such capacity, or arising out of his/her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him/her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
The foregoing rights of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any director or officer may be entitled apart from the provisions of this Article VII.
The chairman of the board, the president, the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, or any other person authorized by the Board of Directors is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority granted herein may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
Section 7.
These bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, when such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the certificate of incorporation, at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new bylaws be contained in the notice of such special meeting. If the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the certificate of incorporation, it shall not divest or limit the power of the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

Stockholder Approved Amendments to the SanDisk Corporation 2005 Incentive Plan (the 2005 Plan)
 
At the annual stockholder meeting of SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant), the stockholders of the Registrant approved certain amendments to the 2005 Plan that were proposed in the Registrants proxy statement filed on April 15, 2009 (the Proxy Statement). The approved amendments (i) increase the number of shares of the Registrants common stock (Common Stock) that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2005 Plan by an additional 5,000,000 shares, which is expected to be used over multiple years, and (ii) increase the allocation of the number of shares which may be issued without cash consideration under the 2005 Plan to 25% of all shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan. The Board of Directors (the Board) of the Registrant previously approved the amendments to the 2005 Plan.
 
The following summary of the 2005 Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the 2005 Plan, which was previously filed as Annex B to the Proxy Statement.
 
The 2005 Plan consists of three separate incentive programs: (i) the discretionary grant program under which eligible individuals may be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock at the fair market value per share on the grant date or stock appreciation rights with a base price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the grant date; (ii) the stock issuance and cash bonus programs under which eligible persons may be issued shares of Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards, which may be subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting requirements, and cash bonus opportunities intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 162(m)); and (iii) the automatic grant program for the non-employee members of the Registrants board of directors pursuant to which new and continuing non-employee board members are to receive grants (in the form of stock options and/or restricted stock or restricted stock units) automatically at periodic intervals over their period of board service. Participation in the discretionary grant and stock issuance and cash bonus programs is limited to employees of the Registrant and its subsidiaries, non-employee members of the Registrants board of directors or the board of directors of any subsidiary, and consultants and other independent advisors in the service of the Registrant or any subsidiary
 
The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2005 Plan equals the sum of (1) 25,700,000 shares (after giving effect to the amendments to the 2005 Plan), plus (2) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under the Registrants 1995 Stock Option Plan or the Registrants 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan and outstanding as of May 27, 2005 that expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised. No participant in the 2005 Plan may receive option grants, stand-alone stock appreciation rights, direct stock issuances (whether vested or unvested) or other stock-based awards for more than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in any single calendar year. The maximum number of shares which may be issued without cash consideration under the stock issuance program may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of shares of Common Stock from time to time authorized for issuance under the 2005 Plan.
 
The Board or one or more committees appointed by the Board administers the 2005 Plan. The Board has delegated general administrative authority for the 2005 Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Board (the Compensation Committee). The plan administrator has full power and authority (subject to the express terms of the 2005 Plan) to select the individuals who are to receive awards under the discretionary grant and stock issuance and cash bonus programs and to determine the time or times when those awards are to be made, the number of shares and the vesting schedule applicable to each award and the remaining terms and conditions of each such award. The plan administrator will also have the discretionary authority to accelerate the vesting of any and all outstanding stock-based awards under these programs. Awards under the automatic option grant program will be made in accordance with the express terms of that program, except for the limited authority of the plan administrator to determine the actual number of shares for which each such award is to be made, subject to the limitations of the program on the maximum number of shares for which awards may be made to new or continuing members of the Registrants board of directors.
 
As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the 2005 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase price of awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the stockholders.

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in these forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A.

On December 29, 2008, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position, or FSP, APB 14-1, .  We have separately accounted for the liability equity components of our 1% Senior Convertible Note due 2013 that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) in a manner that reflects our economic interest cost.  In addition, we bifurcated the debt into debt and equity components and will accrete the debt discount that will result in the economic interest cost being reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  We have retrospectively applied FSP APB 14-1 to all periods presented, from the issuance of the debt in May 2006, and have recasted the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report.

Overview
 
 
General
 
We are the inventor of and worldwide leader in NAND-based flash storage cards.  Our mission is to provide simple, reliable and affordable storage for consumer use in portable devices.  We sell SanDisk branded products for consumer electronics through broad global retail and OEM distribution channels.
 
We design, develop and manufacture products and solutions in a variety of form factors using our flash memory, controller and firmware technologies.  We source the vast majority of our flash memory supply through our significant venture relationships with Toshiba which provide us with leading-edge, low-cost memory wafers.  Our cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, gaming devices and laptop computers.  We also produce USB drives, MP3 players, SSDs, and embedded flash storage products.
 
- 2 -
Our results are primarily driven by worldwide demand for flash storage devices, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products.  We believe the market for flash storage is generally price elastic.  Accordingly, we expect that as we reduce the price of our flash devices, consumers will demand an increasing number of gigabytes and/or units of memory and that over time, new markets will emerge.  In order to profitably capitalize on price elasticity of demand in the market for flash storage products, we must reduce our cost per gigabyte at a rate similar to the change in selling price per gigabyte, and the average capacity of our products must grow enough to offset price declines.  We seek to achieve these cost reductions through technology improvements, primarily by increasing the amount of memory stored in a given area of silicon.
 
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, or SFAS 157, , as of the beginning of fiscal year 2008.  In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, , which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually.  Therefore, we have only adopted the provisions of SFAS 157 with respect to our financial assets and liabilities.  SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements.  Fair value is defined under SFAS 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  Valuation techniques used to measure fair value under SFAS 157 must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  See Note 3, Investments and Fair Value Measurements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Fair Value Measurements
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157
 
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, or SFAS 159, , which permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value.  As of December 28, 2008, we did not elect the fair value option for any financial assets and liabilities that were not previously measured at fair value.  See Note 3, Investments and Fair Value Measurements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates
 
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.
 
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, long-lived assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, contingencies, share-based compensation, and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources.  Estimates have historically approximated actual results.  However, future results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
Use of Estimates.  
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, or SFAS 144, , we perform tests for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that other long-lived assets may not be recoverable.  This analysis differs from our goodwill analysis in that an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment.  If the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows.  We recorded impairments of certain acquisition-related amortizable intangible assets of $176 million in fiscal year 2008 based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows.  In addition, we recorded impairments of our investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance of $83 million in fiscal year 2008 based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows.  These forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins, risk-adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables.  Our estimates of market segment growth and our market segment share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business.  Our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information.  If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges.  We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.  Actual future results may differ from those estimates.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill.
 
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
 
We perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year, or more often if there are indicators of impairment present.  The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, or SFAS 142, , require that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill.  In the first step, or Step 1, we compare our fair value to our carrying value.  If the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing.  If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value, then we must perform the second step, or Step 2, of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.  To determine the fair value used in Step 1, we use our market capitalization based upon our quoted closing stock price per NASDAQ, including an estimated control premium that an investor would be willing to pay for a controlling interest in us.  The determination of a control premium requires the use of judgment and is based primarily on comparable industry and deal-size transactions, related synergies and other benefits.  When we are required to perform a Step 2 analysis, determining the fair value of our net assets and our off-balance sheet intangibles used in Step 2 requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.  We performed our annual impairment test on the first day of  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and determined that the goodwill was not impaired.  However, based on a combination of factors, including the economic environment, our current and forecasted operating results, NAND-industry pricing conditions  and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and we recognized an impairment charge of $845.5 million.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs.  
We recognize revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization.  Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and/or right of return and, therefore, the sales and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire.  At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, deferred income from sales to distributors and retailers was $75.7 million and $167.3 million, respectively.  Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and deferred revenue and were not material for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
We record estimated reductions to revenue or to deferred revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co-op advertising, and other volume-based incentives and expected returns.  Additionally, we have incentive programs that require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.  All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues.  In calculating the value of sales incentive programs, actual and estimated activity is used based upon reported weekly sell-through data from our customers.  The timing and resolution of these claims could materially impact product revenues or deferred revenues.  In addition, actual returns and rebates in any future period could differ from our estimates, which could impact the revenue we report.
 
Inventories and Inventory Valuation.  
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal.  The determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based upon recent sales, industry trends, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analysis of supply and demand and seasonal factors.  Should actual market conditions differ from our estimates, our future results of operations could be materially affected.  The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory.  The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons, generally six to twelve months.  To the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than both our product on-hand and on noncancelable orders, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a negative impact on our gross margin.
 
Accounting for Variable Interest Entities.  
We evaluate whether entities in which we have invested are variable interest entities within the definition of the FASB Interpretation No. 46R, or FIN 46R, If those entities are variable interest entities, or VIEs, we then determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of that entity by reference to our contractual and business arrangements with respect to expected gains and losses.  The assessment of the primary beneficiary includes an analysis of the forecast and contractual stipulations of the VIE.  Determining whether we would consolidate or apply the equity method to a particular VIE requires review of the VIEs forecast, which involves analysis of company specific data, industry data, known trends and uncertainties, which are inherently subjective.  Consolidating a VIE under FIN 46R rather than using the equity method can materially impact revenue, gross margin and operating income trends.
Accounting for Variable Interest Entities.  
 
Deferred Tax Assets.  
We must make certain estimates in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes.  These estimates occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.  In determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income, estimates of future income and tax planning strategies.  We have incurred cumulative losses in recent years and determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, based on all available evidence, that there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods and accordingly we recorded a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our U.S. and certain foreign net deferred tax assets.
 
Our estimates for tax uncertainties require substantial judgment based upon the period of occurrence, complexity of the matter, available federal tax case law, interpretation of foreign laws and regulations and other estimates.  There is no assurance that domestic or international tax authorities will agree with the tax positions we have taken which could materially impact future results.

Results of Operations
 
Product Revenues.
 
The decrease in our fiscal year 2008 product revenues compared to fiscal year 2007 reflected a 62% reduction in average selling price per gigabyte, partially offset by a 125% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, which reflected 15% growth in memory product units sold and 96% growth in average capacity.  The decline in retail product revenues in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was due to aggressive price declines partially offset by a 116% increase in gigabytes sold.  The decline in original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, product revenues in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was due to aggressive price declines, partially offset by a 135% increase in gigabytes sold, and the discontinuation of TwinSys Data Storage Limited Partnership, or TwinSys, operations on March 31, 2007, which contributed $53 million of product revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 prior to ceasing operations.  We believe the unit growth of 15% in fiscal year 2008 was below the 75% unit growth in fiscal year 2007 due primarily to deteriorating worldwide economic conditions.
 
The increase in our fiscal year 2007 product revenues was comprised of a 190% increase in the number of gigabytes sold, partially offset by a 60% reduction in average selling price per gigabyte.  Our unit sales increased 75% compared to fiscal year 2006 with the strongest unit growth coming from cards for mobile phones.  OEM revenue particularly benefited from higher sales of mobile cards and embedded products to mobile handset vendors.  Retail revenue growth benefited from the growing market for cards for mobile phones as well as increased sales of USB flash drives.
 
Geographical Product Revenues.
 
Product revenues in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 decreased in all geographical regions due to aggressive industry price declines partially offset by unit sales growth in all regions except Japan.  Revenue and unit sales in Japan declined on a year over year basis due to lower sales of OEM USB drives and cards, and the discontinuation of TwinSys operations on March 31, 2007, which contributed $53 million of product revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 prior to ceasing operations.
 
In fiscal year 2007, revenue growth was strong in both APAC and EMEA primarily as a result of increased sales to OEM mobile handset vendors and the growth of mobile card and USB sales in international retail channels.  Japan revenue increased from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007 primarily as a result of product revenue from our msystems acquisition in November 2006.  Unit sales in the U.S. increased 41% over fiscal year 2006; however total revenues in the U.S. were lower by 2% due primarily to aggressive price reductions in fiscal year 2007.
 
- 6 -
License and Royalty Revenues.
 
The increase in our fiscal year 2008 license and royalty revenues was primarily due to the addition of new licensees.
 
The increase in our fiscal year 2007 license and royalty revenues was primarily due to new license agreements as well as increased royalty-bearing sales by our existing licensees.
 
Gross Margins.
 
Product gross margins in fiscal year 2008 decreased 37.5 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to aggressive industry price declines resulting in the sale of products at negative gross margins and related charges.  The related charges in fiscal year 2008 included:
Inventory reserves primarily to reduce the carrying value to the lower-of-cost-or-market for both inventory on-hand and in the channel of $394 million.
Charges of $121 million for adverse purchase commitments associated with under-utilization of Flash Ventures capacity for the 90-day period in which we have non-cancellable orders.
Impairment in our investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance of $83 million
Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets is expected to decline in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to impairments recorded in fiscal year 2008.
 
In fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we sold $27 million, $13 million and $14 million, respectively, of inventory that had been fully written-off in previous periods.
 
Product gross margins in fiscal year 2007 decreased 9.2 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2006 due to excess industry supply which led to price per megabyte declining faster than cost per megabyte and also led to lower-of-cost-or-market inventory charges.  Gross margin was also negatively impacted by charges for excess inventory of certain products and Flash Alliance venture costs, partially offset by insurance proceeds related to claims on a fab power outage that occurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.  In addition, cost of product increased due to amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $65 million, which accounted for approximately 1.4 percentage points.
 
- 7 -
Research and Development.
 
Our fiscal year 2008 research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll, payroll-related expenses and headcount-related expenses of approximately $21 million, an increase in consulting and material and equipment costs of $6 million, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense of ($10) million and lower Flash Venture related costs of ($7) million.  The growth in fiscal year 2008 research and development expense reflects parallel investment in NAND X2, X3 and X4 storage technologies, and 3D Read/Write memory architecture technology.
 
Our fiscal year 2007 research and development expense growth was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses of $43 million associated with headcount growth and our acquisition of msystems, higher consultant and outside service costs of $17 million, higher non-recurring engineering and material costs of $11 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million related to increased headcount.  In addition, in fiscal year 2007 we recognized Flash Alliance start-up costs of $18 million.
 
Sales and Marketing.
 
Our fiscal year 2008 sales and marketing expense growth over the comparable period in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to increased branding and merchandising costs of $34 million and increased employee-related costs of $13 million, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense of ($12) million.  The growth in branding and merchandising and employee-related costs primarily reflected expansion of our international sales channels.  Due to our restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will be lower in fiscal year 2009 than in fiscal year 2008.  For further discussion, see Restructuring Charges and Other below.
 
Our fiscal year 2007 sales and marketing expense growth included increased advertising and promotional costs on a worldwide basis of approximately $41 million.  In addition, payroll and payroll-related expenses increased $31 million and share-based compensation expense increased $9 million, both related to full-year increased headcount and our acquisition of msystems in November 2006.
 
General and Administrative.
 
Our fiscal year 2008 general and administrative expense growth over the comparable period in fiscal year 2007 was primarily related to increased legal and outside advisor costs of $30 million and bad debt expense of $5 million, partially offset by lower share-based compensation costs of ($9) million and payroll and employee-related costs of ($3) million.  Our legal and outside advisor costs increased in fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 primarily due to increased patent and anti-trust litigation expenses as well as expenses incurred in connection with strategic initiatives.  Due to our restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we expect that our general and administrative payroll and employee-related expenses will be lower in fiscal year 2009 than in fiscal year 2008.  For further discussion, see Restructuring Charges and Other below.
 
Our fiscal year 2007 general and administrative expense increases were primarily related to increased payroll, payroll-related expenses and share-based compensation expense associated with headcount increases including our acquisition of msystems in November 2006.

Impairment of Goodwill.
 
In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed and tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired.  We performed our annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and determined that the goodwill was not impaired.  However, based on a combination of factors, including the economic environment, current and forecasted operating results, NAND-industry pricing conditions and a sustained decline in our market capitalization, we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and we recognized an impairment charge of $845.5 million.
 
Impairment of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets.
 
In accordance with SFAS 144, we recorded a $176 million impairment on acquisition-related intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  This impairment was based upon forecasted discounted cash flows which considered factors including a reduced business outlook primarily due to NAND-industry pricing conditions.
 
Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets.
 
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 was lower due to intangible assets that were fully amortized in fiscal year 2007.  Our expense from the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was primarily related to our acquisitions of Matrix in January 2006 and msystems in November 2006.  Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets is expected to decline in fiscal year 2009 primarily due to impairments recorded in fiscal year 2008.
 
The increase of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 was directly related to twelve months of amortization in fiscal year 2007 from our acquisition of msystems compared to less than two months of amortization in fiscal year 2006.

Write-off of Acquired In-Process Technology.
 
As part of the Matrix acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 and the msystems acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, a portion of each purchase price was allocated to acquired in-process technology, which was determined through established valuation techniques in the high-technology industry and written-off at the date of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed.  The value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values.  As of December 28, 2008, we estimated that the remaining in-process projects related to the msystems acquisition would be completed over the next two quarters at an estimated total cost of $4 million.  As of December 28, 2008, all in-process projects related to the Matrix acquisition were completed.
 
Restructuring Charges and Other.
 
During fiscal years 2008 and 2007, we implemented several restructuring plans which included reductions of our workforce and consolidation of operations.  We recorded restructuring charges and other of $36 million and $7 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The goal of these restructuring and other charges was to bring our operational expenses to appropriate levels relative to our net revenues, while simultaneously implementing extensive company-wide expense-control programs.  All expenses, including adjustments, associated with our restructuring plans are included in Restructuring Charges and Other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  For further discussion of our restructuring plans, refer to Note 10, Restructuring Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 
Fiscal 2008 Restructuring and Other
 
We recorded restructuring and other charges of $
36 million for plans implemented in fiscal year 2008.  Of these charges, $15 million related to severance and benefits for employee reductions worldwide and $21 million related to marketing contract termination costs, technology license impairments and fixed asset impairments related to outsourcing certain manufacturing activities.  In addition, restructuring and other charges include an accrual for unrelated litigation settlements.
 
We expect to reduce our annual cost and operating expenses by approximately $53 million as a result of our fiscal year 2008 restructuring plans.  Approximately 19%, 33%, 31% and 17% of the restructuring cost savings related to the fiscal year 2008 restructuring plans are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenues, research and development expense, sales and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense, respectively.
 
Fiscal 2007 Restructuring
 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, management approved and initiated plans to bring our operational expenses to appropriate levels relative to our net revenues, while simultaneously implementing extensive company-wide expense-control programs.  This restructuring plan eliminated certain duplicative assets and resources in all functions of the organization worldwide due to consolidating certain processes in order to reduce our cost structure, which resulted in a charge of $7 million in fiscal year 2007.
 
- 10 -
Other Income.
 
Our fiscal year 2008 other income decrease compared to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to lower interest income in fiscal year 2008 reflecting reduced interest rates and lower cash and investment balances, impairment of our equity investment in Tower of ($19) million, and an impairment of our investment in FlashVision of ($10) million.
 
Our fiscal year 2007 other income was lower than fiscal year 2006 primarily due to a full year interest and amortization of bond discount expense of ($63)
 million resulting from our $1.15 billion debt offering in May 2006 and the acquired msystems $75 million debt offering
, and an impairment charge of ($10) million to the wind-down of our FlashVision investment included in Income (loss) in equity investments offset by increased interest income due to higher cash balances.
 
Provision for Income Taxes.
 
Our fiscal year 2008 provision for income taxes was an expense of $34 million with a negative effective tax rate of 1.8%. This is primarily due to the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge and a valuation allowance recorded on certain U.S. and foreign gross deferred tax assets.  The valuation allowance was due primarily to the size of the fiscal year 2008 net loss and that it is not more likely than not that certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.  Fiscal year 2007 had a provision for income taxes of $157 million and an effective tax rate of 44.5%, which was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to non-deductible share-based compensation expenses and certain foreign losses partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at other than U.S. rates and tax-exempt interest.
 
Our fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate decreased from fiscal year 2006 primarily due to the fiscal year 2006 write-off of acquired in-process technology and higher tax-exempt interest income in fiscal year 2007.  This decrease was partially offset by foreign losses not benefited and non-deductible share-based compensation expenses.
 
Our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits related to FASB Interpretation No. 48, increased by $69 million and $46 million in fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
Our cash flows were as follows:
Cash Flows.  
 
Cash provided by operating activities is generated by net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.  Cash provided by operations was $ million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to cash provided by operations of $653 million for fiscal year 2007.  The decline in cash provided by operations in fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 resulted primarily from our net loss of $ billion offset by non-cash impairments.  Cash flow from accounts receivable in fiscal year 2008 was positively impacted by increased collection efforts and by reduced product accounts receivable levels as compared with the prior year period.  The increase in inventory was related primarily to the expansion of capacity and production at Flash Alliance and Flash Partners while revenue from our products declined from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008.  The increase in other assets was due to the increase in tax receivables related to tax refunds expected on carryback claims due to the fiscal year 2008 net loss.  Within operating activities for fiscal year 2008, there was an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in related parties payables due to timing of Flash Ventures payments at fiscal year 2008 year end, an increase in other liabilities related to Flash Ventures capacity under utilization accrual, timing of the cash settlement of outstanding hedge contracts, and lower deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers related to lower revenue levels.
Operating Activities.  
88
1.99
 
Operating activities generated $ million of cash during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007.  The primary sources of operating cash flow for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007 were: (1) net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, loss on equity investments and deferred taxes, and (2) changes in balance sheet accounts including a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable trade and accounts payable to related parties, which were partially offset by increases in inventory and other assets and a decrease in other liabilities.
653
 
  Cash provided from investing activities for fiscal year 2008 was $29 million as compared to cash used in investing activities of $1.12 billion in fiscal year 2007.  The increase in cash provided from investing was primarily related to reduced purchases of short and long-term investments due to our higher liquidity requirements and the return of $103 million on our investment in FlashVision and $40 million from the sale of 200-millimeter fab equipment that we owned directly as compared to the return of $38 million from FlashVision in the fiscal year 2007.  Usage of cash for investments in and loans to Flash Partners and Flash Alliance was $384 million in fiscal year 2008 compared to $651 million in fiscal year 2007.
Investing Activities.
 
We used $1.22 billion for investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007.  Purchases of short and long-term investments, net of p
roceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, totaled $318 million.  Capital expenditures for the year were $259 million and investments and notes to
FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance
were $613 million, net of repayments.
 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year 2008 of $ million as compared to cash used in financing activities of $181 million in fiscal year 2007 was primarily related to lower cash proceeds from employee stock programs and repayment of debt financing in fiscal year 2008 offset by the termination of the share repurchase programs which used cash in fiscal year 2007.
Financing Activities.
11
 
We used $181 million of cash for financing activities during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007 comprised primarily of $300 million to purchase treasury shares pursuant to our share repurchase program, partially offset by cash received from exercises of share-based awards of $100 million.  Additionally, during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007, we received a tax benefit of $18 million on employee stock programs.
 
At December 28, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.44 billion.  We have $1.10 billion of long-term investments which we believe are also liquid assets, but are classified as long-term investments due to the remaining maturity of the investment being greater than one year.
Liquid Assets.  
 
- 12 -
As of December 28, 2008, our working capital balance was $1.45 billion.  We expect our loans to and investments in Flash Ventures as well as our investments in property, plant and equipment to be approximately $0.5 billion in fiscal year 2009.
Short-Term Liquidity.  
 
Our short-term liquidity is impacted in part by our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in the outstanding Flash Ventures master lease agreements.  The Flash Ventures master lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities as well as an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to us as guarantor, including, among other things, our failure to maintain a minimum shareholder equity of at least $1.51 billion, and our failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of BB- from Standard & Poors, or S&P, or Moodys Corporation, or a minimum corporate rating of BB+ from Rating & Investment Information, Inc., or R&I.  As of December 28, 2008, Flash Ventures was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants.  While our S&P credit rating was B, two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from S&P, our R&I credit rating was BBB-, one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from R&I.
 
On February 4, 2009, R&I confirmed our credit rating at BBB- with a change in outlook from stable to negative.  If R&I were to downgrade our credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold, Flash Ventures would become non-compliant with certain covenants under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non-compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements.  Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by us, as guarantor, or increased interest rates or waiver fees, should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances.  If a resolution was unsuccessful, we could be required to pay a portion or the entire outstanding lease obligations covered by our guarantee under such Flash Ventures master lease agreements of up to $2.09 billion, based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008, which could negatively impact our short-term liquidity.
 
Depending on the demand for our products, we may decide to make additional investments, which could be substantial, in wafer fabrication foundry capacity and assembly and test manufacturing equipment to support our business in the future.  We may also make equity investments in other companies or engage in merger or acquisition transactions.  These activities may require us to raise additional financing, which could be difficult to obtain, and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts could prevent us from funding Flash Ventures; increasing our wafer supply; developing or enhancing our products; taking advantage of future opportunities; engaging in investments in or acquisitions of companies; growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes; any of which could harm our business.
Long-Term Requirements.  
 
At December 28, 2008, we had $1.23 billion of aggregate principal amount in convertible notes outstanding, consisting of $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 and $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035.  Our 1% Convertible Notes due 2035 may be redeemed in whole or in part by the holders thereof at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on March 15, 2010 and various dates thereafter.
Financing Arrangements.  
 
Concurrent with the issuance of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $95.03 per share.  As of December 28, 2008, the warrants had an expected life of approximately 4.6 years and expire in August 2013.  At expiration, we may, at our option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis.  As of December 28, 2008, the warrants had not been exercised and remain outstanding.  In addition, counterparties agreed to sell to us up to approximately 14.0 million shares of our common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 in full, at a conversion price of $82.36 per share.  The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 or the first day that none of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise.  Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares on the expiration date would result in us receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by us upon conversion of the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013.  As of December 28, 2008, we had not purchased any shares under this convertible bond hedge agreement.  See Note 7, Financing Arrangements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

We are a 49.9% owner in both Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, or hereinafter referred to as Flash Ventures, our business ventures with Toshiba to develop and manufacture NAND flash memory products.  These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by Flash Ventures.  This equipment is funded or will be funded by investments in or loans to the Flash Ventures from us and Toshiba as well as through operating leases received by Flash Ventures from third-party banks and guaranteed by us and Toshiba.  Flash Ventures purchase wafers from Toshiba at cost and then resells those wafers to us and Toshiba at cost plus a markup.  We are contractually obligated to purchase half of Flash Ventures NAND wafer supply or to pay for 50% of the fixed costs of Flash Ventures.  We are not able to estimate our total wafer purchase obligations beyond our rolling three month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost to produce the wafers.  See Note 14, Related Parties and Strategic Investments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Flash Partners and Flash Alliance Ventures with Toshiba.  
 
The cost of the wafers we purchase from Flash Ventures is recorded in inventory and ultimately cost of product revenues.  Flash Ventures are variable interest entities; however, we are not the primary beneficiary of these ventures because we are entitled to less than a majority of expected gains and losses with respect to each venture.  Accordingly, we account for our investments under the equity method and do not consolidate.
 
Under Flash Ventures agreements, we agreed to share in Toshibas costs associated with NAND product development and our common semiconductor research and development activities.  As of December 28, 2008, we had accrued liabilities related to those common research and development expenses of $4.0 million.  Our common research and development obligation related to Flash Ventures is variable based on an annual forecasted joint research and development costs as mutually agreed upon by us and Toshiba.  In addition to general NAND product development and common semiconductor research performed by Toshiba, both parties perform direct research and development activities specific to Flash Ventures, and our contribution is based on a variable computation.  We and Toshiba each pay the cost of our own design teams and 50% of the wafer processing and similar costs associated with this direct design and development of flash memory.
 
For semiconductor fixed assets that are leased by Flash Ventures, we and/or Toshiba jointly guarantee on an unsecured and several basis, 50% of the outstanding Flash Ventures lease obligations under master lease agreements entered into from December 2004 through December 2008.  These master lease obligations are denominated in Japanese yen and are noncancelable.  Our total master lease obligation guarantee, net of lease payments, as of December 28, 2008, was  189.4 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $2.09 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008.
 
From time-to-time, we and Toshiba mutually approve increases in the wafer supply capacity of Flash Ventures that may contractually obligate us to increase capital funding.  As of December 28, 2008, Flash Partners Fab 3 had reached full capacity of approximately 150,000 wafers per month; however, we expect to continue to invest in Flash Partners in order to convert to future technology nodes.  The capacity of Flash Alliances Fab 4 at full expansion is expected to be approximately 210,000 wafers per month, and the timeframe to reach full capacity is to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.  In During the remainder of fiscal year 2009, we expect to invest approximately $425 million in Flash Ventures primarily for future technology nodes, which we expect will be funded through additional investments and loans to Flash Ventures, and working capital contributions from Flash Ventures.

,
Fab 4 was ramped to
more than 50% of this estimated full capacity
.  We are currently not investing in further capacity expansion of Fab 4 as weak macroeconomic conditions coupled with the growth of our NAND supply base have resulted in us carrying excess inventory.
 
 
On January 29, 2009, we entered into definitive agreements with Toshiba, under which we and Toshiba agreed to restructure Flash Partners and Flash Alliance to provide for the acquisition by Toshiba of certain production capacity in connection with the production of NAND flash memory products at the facilities.   more than 20% of its current production capacity through the acquisition by Toshiba of certain owned and leased equipment.  The total value of the restructuring transaction to us is approximately $890 million based upon the exchange rate as of January 29, 2009.  Approximately one-third of this value will be in cash paid to us and approximately two-thirds of this value represents a transfer of lease obligations to Toshiba which should reduce our outstanding lease obligations and associated lease guarantees by approximately 28%.  These transactions are expected to occur at several closings between January 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, subject to certain closing conditions and contingencies.

In the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we and Toshiba determined that production of NAND flash memory products utilizing 200-millimeter wafers was no longer cost effective relative to market prices for NAND flash memory and decided to wind-down the FlashVision venture.  As part of the ongoing wind-down of FlashVision, Toshiba purchased certain assets of FlashVision.  The existing master equipment lease agreement between FlashVision and a consortium of financial institutions has been retired, thereby releasing us from our contingent indemnification obligation with Toshiba.  Due to the wind-down qualifying as a reconsideration event under FIN 46R, we re-evaluated and concluded that FlashVision is no longer a variable interest entity within the scope of FIN 46R.  In fiscal year 2008, we received distributions of $103 million, relating to our investment in FlashVision.  We took impairment charges of $10 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and $10 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 due to FlashVisions difficulty in selling the remaining excess capital equipment due to deteriorating market conditions for equipment related to the production of 200-millimeter NAND-based flash memory products.  At December 28, 2008, we had a net investment in FlashVision of $64 million denominated in Japanese yen, offset by $43 million of cumulative translation adjustments recorded in accumulated OCI within Stockholders Equity of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
Our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements at December 28, 2008, and the effect those contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow over the next five years are presented in textual and tabular format in Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 
Impact of Currency Exchange Rates
 
Exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the Japanese yen in which we purchase the vast majority of our NAND flash wafers.  In addition, we also have significant costs denominated in the Chinese renminbi, or RMB, and the Israeli New shekel, or ILS.  We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.  In fiscal years 2008 and 2007, we used foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  In addition, in fiscal year 2008, we used foreign currency forward contracts and options to partially hedge our future Japanese yen costs for NAND flash wafers.  Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income (expense) or as a component of accumulated OCI and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized.  See Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
(a)       Documents filed as part of this report
1) All financial statements
 
 
F-1
 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
SanDisk Corporation
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of SanDisk Corporation as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2008.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SanDisk Corporation at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on December 29, 2008, SanDisk Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) No. APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1),
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
and Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 ("SFAS 160"),
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51,
and retrospectively adjusted all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements for the changes.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of SanDisk Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria) and our report, dated February 20, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Note 1: 
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
SanDisk Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the Company) was incorporated in Delaware on June 1, 1988.  The Company designs, develops, markets and manufactures flash storage card products used in a wide variety of consumer electronics products.  The Company operates in one segment, flash memory storage products.
Organization and Nature of Operations.  
 
The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31.  Fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 each consisted of 52 weeks.
Basis of Presentation.  
 
Adjustment for Retrospective Application of Accounting Pronouncements
.
  The financial statements presented herein have been
adjusted to reflect
the retrospective application of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1),
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement)
, a retroactive change in accounting principle.  In addition, the financial statements have also been adjusted for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
160 (SFAS 160),
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51
.
 
.  
SFAS 160
As a result of the adoption of SFAS 160, the Company has reclassified for all periods presented non-controlling interests, formerly called a minority interest, to a component of equity in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests has been separately identified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Consolidated Statements of Equity.  The Company has also reclassified certain distributions to non-controlling interests from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from investing activities for fiscal years ended December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007.  SFAS 160 applies prospectively, except for presentation and disclosure requirements, which have been applied retrospectively to these financial statements.
 
FSP APB 14-1
.  FSP APB 14-1 is effective for the Companys $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 (the 1% Notes due 2013) and requires retrospective application for all periods presented.
  FSP APB 14-1 requires the issuer of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument.
 
As a result of the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the Company has separately accounted for the liability and equity components of its 1% Notes due 2013.  The Company calculated the value of the conversion component of the debt and recorded this value as a component of equity and a corresponding debt discount.  The debt discount, which is a reduction to the carrying value of the debt, will be amortized as additional non-cash interest expense over the term of the original note.  The retrospective application of this pronouncement affects years 2006 through
2008
.  Income taxes have been recorded on the foregoing adjustments to the extent applicable.  See Note
7
, Financing Arrangements.
 
With the adoption of FSP APB 14-1 and SFAS 160, the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were retroactively stated as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
 
 
F-7
 
 
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Non-controlling interest represents the minority shareholders proportionate share of the net assets and results of operations of the Companys majority-owned subsidiaries.  The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the results of companies acquired by the Company from the date of each acquisition.
Principles of Consolidation.  
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  The estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories and related reserves, investments, long-lived assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring, contingencies, share-based compensation and litigation.  The Company bases estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that its management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.  These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when those values are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Use of Estimates
.  
 
F-8
The Company recognizes revenues when the earnings process is complete, as evidenced by an agreement with the customer, transfer of title and acceptance, if applicable, fixed or determinable pricing and reasonable assurance of realization.  Sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and/or a right of return and, therefore, the revenues and related costs of these transactions are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell-through the merchandise to their end customer, or the rights of return expire.  Estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to product revenue and were not material for any period presented in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  The cost of shipping products to customers is included in Cost of Product Revenues.  The Company recognizes expenses related to sales commissions in the period in which they are earned.
Revenue Recognition, Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Incentive Programs.  
 
Revenue from patent licensing arrangements is recognized when earned and estimable.  The timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each license agreement and on the timing of sales of licensed products.  The Company generally recognizes royalty revenue when it is reported to the Company by its licensees, which is generally one quarter in arrears from the licensees sales.  For licensing fees that are not determined by the number of licensed units sold, the Company recognizes license fee revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the license.
 
The Company records estimated reductions of revenue for customer and distributor incentive programs and offerings, including price protection, promotions, co-op advertising and other volume-based incentives and expected returns.  Additionally, the Company has incentive programs that require it to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.  All sales incentive programs are recorded as an offset to product revenues or deferred revenues.  Marketing development programs are recorded as a reduction to revenue in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 01-9 (EITF 01-9), .
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products)
 
Accounts receivable include amounts owed by geographically dispersed distributors, retailers and OEM customers.  No collateral is required.  Provisions are provided for sales returns and credit losses.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.  
 
The Company estimates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.  In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to the Company (e.g., bankruptcy filings or substantial down-grading of credit ratings), the Company provides allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected.
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, but have not been reflected in the Company's taxable income.  A valuation allowance has been established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.  Therefore, the Company provides a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Income Taxes.  
 
The Company determines the functional currency for its parent company and each of its subsidiaries by reviewing the currencies in which their respective operating activities occur.  Transaction gains and losses arising from activities in other than the applicable functional currency are calculated using average exchange rates for the applicable period and reported in Net Income (Loss) as a non-operating item in each period.  Non-monetary balance sheet items denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional currency are translated using the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date and any gains and losses are included in cumulative translation adjustment.  The Company continuously evaluates its foreign currency exposures and may continue to enter into hedges or other risk mitigating arrangements in the future.  Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gain (loss) prior to corresponding foreign exchange hedge offset recorded to Net Income (Loss) was $181.3 million, $15.6 million and ($2.5) million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Foreign Currency.

Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid financial instruments with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.  Investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term investments.  Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year as of the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments.  Short and long-term fixed income investments consist of commercial paper, United States (U.S.) government and agency obligations, corporate/municipal notes and bonds, and variable rate demand notes.  Both short and long-term investments also include investments in certain equity securities.  The fair market value, based on quoted market prices, of cash equivalents, and short and long-term investments at December 28, 2008, approximated their carrying value.  Cost of securities sold is based on a first-in, first-out method.
Cash Equivalents, Short and Long-Term Investments.  
 
In determining if and when a decline in market value below cost of these investments is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates both quantitative and qualitative information including the market conditions, offering prices, trends of earnings, price multiples and other key measures.  When such a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline.
 
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, estimated residual value, if any, and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter, ranging from two to twenty-five years.
Property and Equipment.  
 
The Company evaluates its equity method investments to determine whether any investee is a variable interest entity within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Interpretation No. 46R (FIN 46R), .  If the Company concludes that an investee is a variable interest entity, the Company evaluates its expected gains and losses of such investee to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the investee.  If the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the Company consolidates such entity and reflects the minority interest of other beneficiaries of that entity.  If the Company concludes that an investee is not a variable interest entity, the Company does not consolidate the investee.
Variable Interest Entities.  
Accounting for Variable Interest Entities
 
The Company accounts for investments in equity securities of other entities, including variable interest entities that are not consolidated, under the cost method of accounting if investments in voting equity interests of the investee is less than 20%.  The equity method of accounting is used if the Companys investment in voting stock is greater than or equal to 20% but less than a majority.  In considering the accounting method for investments less than 20%, the Company also considers other factors such as its ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee.  If certain factors are present, the Company could account for investments for which it has less than a 20% ownership under the equity method of accounting.  Investments in public companies with restrictions of less than one year are classified as available-for-sale and are adjusted to their fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Investments in public companies with restrictions greater than one year are carried at cost.  Investments in public and non-public companies are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if their value has been impaired and adjustments are recorded as necessary.  Upon disposition of these investments, the specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis in computing realized gains or losses.  Declines in value that are judged to be other-than-temporary are reported in Other Income (Expense) or Cost of Product Revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  See Note 4, Balance Sheet Information - Notes Receivable and Investments in Flash Ventures with Toshiba, regarding impairment of equity method investments in fiscal year 2008.
Equity Investments.  
 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  Market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by estimated costs of disposal.  Should actual market conditions differ from the Companys estimates, the Companys future results of operations could be materially affected.  Reductions in inventory valuation are included in Cost of Product Revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Companys inventory impairment charges permanently establish a new cost basis and are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable.  Rather these amounts are reversed into income only if, as and when the inventory is sold.
Inventories and Inventory Valuation.  
 
The Company reduces the carrying value of its inventory to a new basis for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, including assumptions about changes in average selling prices.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional reductions in inventory valuation may be required.
 
The Companys finished goods inventory includes consigned inventory held at customer locations as well as at third-party fulfillment centers and subcontractors.
 
Intangible assets with definite useful lives and other long-lived assets are tested for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (SFAS 144), The Company assesses the carrying value of long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long-lived assets may not be recoverable.  Factors the Company considers important which could result in an impairment review include: (1) significant under-performance relative to the historical or projected future operating results; (2) significant changes in the manner of use of assets; (3) significant negative industry or economic trends; and (4) significant changes in the Companys market capitalization relative to net book value.  Any changes in key assumptions about the business or prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations.  See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, regarding impairment of long-lived assets in fiscal year 2008.

For certain of the Companys financial instruments, including accounts receivable, short-term investments and accounts payable, the carrying amounts approximate fair market value due to their short maturities.  See Note 3, Investments and Fair Value Measurements, for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.  For those financial instruments where the carrying amounts differ from fair market value, the following table represents the related cost basis and the estimated fair values, which are based on quoted market prices (in millions):
Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  
 
 
Marketing co-op development programs, where the Company receives, or will receive, an identifiable benefit (i.e. goods or services) in exchange for the amount paid to its customer and the Company can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit it receives for the customer incentive payment, are classified, when granted, as marketing expense.  Advertising expenses not meeting this criteria are classified as a reduction to product revenue.  Any other advertising expenses not meeting these conditions are expensed as incurred.  Advertising expenses were $39.9 million, $35.5 million and $24.8 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
).  In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised) (SFAS 141(R)), .  SFAS 141(R) changes the accounting for business combinations by requiring that an acquiring entity measure and recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value with limited exceptions on the acquisition date.  The changes include the treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs, the valuation of any noncontrolling interest at acquisition date fair value, the recording of acquired contingent liabilities at acquisition date fair value and the subsequent re-measurement of such liabilities after the acquisition date, the recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals subsequent to the acquisition date, and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance.  In addition, any changes to the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions related to pre-acquisition periods will be recorded through income tax expense, whereas the current accounting treatment requires any adjustment to be recognized through the purchase price.  SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited.  The adoption of SFAS 141(R) is expected to change the Companys accounting treatment prospectively for all business combinations consummated after the effective date.
SFAS No. 141 (revised

Note 3: 
Investments and Fair Value Measurements
 
Effective December 31, 2007, the Company adopted the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), , which establishes specific criteria for the fair value measurements of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are already subject to fair value measurements under current accounting rules. SFAS 157 also requires expanded disclosures related to fair value measurements.  In February 2008, the FASB approved FSP Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157-2 (FSP SFAS 157-2), , which allows companies to elect a one-year delay in applying SFAS 157 to certain fair value measurements, primarily related to nonfinancial instruments.  The Company elected the delayed adoption date for the portions of SFAS 157 impacted by FSP SFAS 157-2.  The partial adoption of SFAS 157 was prospective and did not have a significant effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying the deferred portion of SFAS 157 to the nonrecurring fair value measurements of its nonfinancial assets and liabilities.  In accordance with FSP SFAS 157-2, the fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will be adopted effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
Fair Value Measurements
Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157
 
Concurrently with the adoption of SFAS 157, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 (SFAS 159), , which permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value.  As of December 28, 2008, the Company did not elect the fair value option under SFAS 159 for any financial assets and liabilities that were not previously measured at fair value.
Establishing the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities
 
.  SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157 are described below:
Fair Value Hierarchy
 
 
A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
The Companys financial assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Instruments that are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy generally include most money market securities, U.S. Treasury securities and equity investments.  Instruments that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy generally include U.S. agency securities, commercial paper, U.S. corporate bonds and municipal obligations.

See Note 14, Related Parties and Strategic Investments  Tower Semiconductor, for discussion on the other than temporary impairment in the Tower equity securities.  Available-for-sale securities that were in an unrealized gain position have been excluded from the table (in thousands):
 
 
The gross unrealized losses related to U.S. corporate and municipal notes and bonds were primarily due to changes in interest rates.  The gross unrealized loss related to publicly traded equity investments were due to changes in market prices.  The Company has cash flow hedges designated to mitigate risk from these equity investments as of December 28, 2008, as discussed in Note 6, Derivatives and Hedging Activities.  Gross unrealized losses on all available-for-sale fixed income securities at December 28, 2008 are considered temporary in nature.  Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the Companys intent and ability to hold an investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
 
Gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008 were immaterial.
 
Fixed income securities at December 28, 2008 by contractual maturity are shown below (in thousands).  Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company recorded a $10.0 million and $10.4 million impairment charge, respectively, related to its equity investment in FlashVision due to FlashVisions difficulty in selling the remaining excess capital equipment due to limited demand for 200-millimeter production equipment.  The FlashVision impairment was recorded in Income (Loss) in Equity Investments as the impairments relate to the wind-down of the venture.  At December 28, 2008, the Company had an investment in FlashVision of $64.0 million denominated in Japanese yen, and related unrealized gains of $43.3 million due to cumulative translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  See Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees  FlashVision, regarding equity method investments in fiscal year 2008.
 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company recorded an impairment to the equity investments in Flash Partners and Flash Alliance of $20.0 million and $63.0 million, respectively, as the fair value of these investments was determined to be less than the carrying value.  These impairments were based upon a comparison of the forecasted discounted cash flows to the carrying value of each venture.  The analysis considered several factors including the volatility in foreign currencies resulting in an appreciation in the carrying value of these Japanese yen denominated assets and a reduced business outlook primarily due to NAND-industry pricing conditions.  The impairment analyses and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment and the use of significant estimates related to valuation such as discount rates, long term growth rates, foreign currency rates and the level and timing of future cash flows.  The Flash Partners and Flash Alliance impairments were recorded in Cost of Product Revenues due to the operational nature of the ventures.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill balance is presented below (in thousands):
Goodwill.  
 
 
 
Goodwill increased by approximately $4.6 million primarily due to the Companys acquisition of MusicGremlin, Inc. (MusicGremlin) during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008.  The goodwill adjustment in fiscal year 2007 was primarily the result of purchase price adjustments related to the msystems Ltd. (msystems) acquisition and to a lesser extent from the Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. (Matrix) acquisition.  See Note 15, Business Acquisitions, regarding these acquisitions in fiscal year 2006.
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, (SFAS 142), , goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed and tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that goodwill might be impaired.  Impairment of goodwill is tested at the Companys reporting unit level by comparing the carrying amount, including goodwill, to the fair value.  In performing the analysis, the Company uses the best information available, including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections.  If the carrying amount of the Company exceeds its implied fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.  The Company performed its annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and determined that the goodwill was not impaired.  However, based on a combination of factors, including the economic environment, current and forecasted operating results, NAND-industry pricing conditions and a sustained decline in the Companys market capitalization, the Company concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and the Company recognized an impairment charge of $845.5 million.

Amortization expense of intangible assets totaled $78.8 million, $98.9 million and $29.8 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  In accordance with SFAS 144, circumstances indicated that the carrying values of certain acquisition-related intangible assets were not recoverable and the Company recorded a $175.8 million impairment on acquisition-related intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  This impairment was based upon forecasted discounted cash flows which considered factors including a reduced business outlook primarily due to NAND-industry pricing conditions.

Note 6: 
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
 
The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency and equity security price risks.  The Companys primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency and equity security prices.  The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.  The Companys derivatives expose the Company to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement.  The Company seeks to mitigate such risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions.  In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
 
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS 133), , the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.  Changes in fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of the derivatives are recorded as cost of product revenues or other income (expense), or as accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI).
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161 (SFAS 161), .  SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS 133, and requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements.  The Company adopted the reporting requirements per SFAS 161 during the second quarter of fiscal year 2008.
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
 
The Company uses a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge a portion of future forecasted purchases in Japanese yen.  The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated OCI and subsequently reclassified into cost of product revenues in the same period or periods in which the cost of product revenues is recognized, or reclassified into other income (expense) if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring.  Any gain or loss after a hedge is de-designated because it is no longer probable of occurring or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge, as well as any amount excluded from the Companys hedge effectiveness, is recognized as other income (expense) immediately.  The net gains or losses relating to ineffectiveness were not material in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008.  As of December 28, 2008, the Company had forward contracts and options in place that hedged future purchases of approximately 31.7 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $352 million, based upon the exchange rate as of December 28, 2008.  The forward and option contracts cover future Japanese yen purchases expected to occur over the next twelve months.
Cash Flow Hedges.  
 
The Company has an outstanding cash flow hedge designated to mitigate equity risk associated with certain available-for-sale investments in equity securities.  The gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated OCI and will be reclassified into other income (expense) in the same period that the equity securities are sold.  The securities had a fair value of $35.2 million and $60.4 million as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.
 
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 consists primarily of forward contracts to minimize the risk associated with the foreign exchange effects of revaluing monetary assets and liabilities.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked-to-market at December 28, 2008 with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in other income (expense).  As of December 28, 2008, the Company had foreign currency forward contracts in place hedging exposures in European euros, Israeli New shekels, Japanese yen and Taiwanese dollars.  Foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding to buy and sell U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately $2.01 billion and ($2.58) billion in foreign currencies, respectively, based upon the exchange rates at December 28, 2008.
Other Derivatives.  
 
For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, non-designated foreign currency forward contracts resulted in a loss of $147.6 million including forward-point income.  For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, the revaluation of the foreign currency exposures hedged by these forward contracts resulted in a gain of $180.5 million.  All of the above noted gains and losses are included in the Interest Expense and Other Income (Expense), net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Financing Arrangements
 
The following table reflects the carrying value of the Companys convertible debt as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 (in millions):
 
 
In May 2006, the Company issued and sold $1.15 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the 1% Notes due 2013) at par.  The 1% Notes due 2013 may be converted, under certain circumstances described below, based on an initial conversion rate of 12.1426 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $82.36 per share).  The net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the 1% Notes due 2013 were $1.13 billion.
1% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013.  
 
The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of the 1% Notes due 2013.  
The principal amount of the liability component ($753.5 million as of the date of issuance) was recognized at the present value of its cash flows using a discount rate of 7.4%, the Companys borrowing rate at the date of the issuance for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature.  
The
carrying value of the
equity component was $241.9 million
as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007
.
 
The following table presents the amount of interest cost recognized for the periods relating to both the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the discount on the liability component of the 1% Notes due 2013 (in millions):
 
 
The remaining bond discount of the 1% Notes due 2013 of $270.9 million as of December 28, 2008 will be amortized over the remaining life of approximately 4.4 years.
 
The 1% Notes due 2013 may be converted prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding February 15, 2013, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount at the option of the holder under any of the following circumstances: 1) during the five business-day period after any five consecutive trading-day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per note for each day of such measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate on each such day; 2) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2006, if the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 120% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or 3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions.  On and after February 15, 2013 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of May 15, 2013, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.
 
 
F-22
 
Upon conversion, a holder will receive the conversion value of the 1% Notes due 2013 to be converted equal to the conversion rate multiplied by the volume weighted average price of the Companys common stock during a specified period following the conversion date.  The conversion value of each 1% Notes due 2013 will be paid in: 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, a combination of common stock and cash.  The conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest.  In addition, upon a fundamental change at any time, as defined, the holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes upon a designated event at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
 
The Company pays cash interest at an annual rate of 1%, payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2006.  Debt issuance costs were approximately $24.5 million, of which $8.7 million was allocated to Capital in excess of par value and  was allocated to deferred issuance costs and is amortized to interest expense over the term of the 1% Notes due 2013.
$15.8 million
 
Concurrently with the issuance of the 1% Notes due 2013, the Company purchased a convertible bond hedge and sold warrants.  The separate convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013 and to increase the initial conversion price to $95.03 per share.  Each of these components are discussed separately below:
 
.  Counterparties agreed to sell to the Company up to approximately 14 million shares of the Companys common stock, which is the number of shares initially issuable upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013 in full, at a price of $82.36 per share.  The convertible bond hedge transaction will be settled in net shares and will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the 1% Notes due 2013 or the first day none of the 1% Notes due 2013 remains outstanding due to conversion or otherwise.  Settlement of the convertible bond hedge in net shares, based on the number of shares issued upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013, on the expiration date would result in the Company receiving net shares equivalent to the number of shares issuable by the Company upon conversion of the 1% Notes due 2013.  Should there be an early unwind of the convertible bond hedge transaction, the number of net shares potentially received by the Company will depend upon 1) the then existing overall market conditions, 2) the Companys stock price, 3) the volatility of the Companys stock, and 4) the amount of time remaining before expiration of the convertible bond hedge.  The convertible bond hedge transaction cost of $386.1 million has been accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-19, (EITF 00-19), .  The Company initially recorded a tax benefit of approximately $145.6 million in stockholders equity from the deferred tax asset related to the convertible bond hedge at inception of the transaction.
Convertible Bond Hedge
Accounting for Derivative Financial Statements Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock
The Company received $308.7 million from the same counterparties from the sale of warrants to purchase up to approximately 14 million shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $95.03 per share.  The warrants have an expected life of 4.5 years and expire in August 2013.  At expiration, the Company may, at its option, elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis.  As of December 28, 2008, the warrants had not been exercised and remained outstanding.  The value of the warrants has been classified as equity because they meet all the equity classification criteria of EITF 00-19.
Sold Warrants.  
In November 2006, the Company assumed the aggregate principal amount of $75.0 million 1% Convertible Senior Notes due March 2035 (the 1% Notes due 2035) from msystems.  The Company is obligated to pay interest on the 1% Notes due 2035 semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 commencing March 15, 2007.
1% Convertible Notes Due 2035.  
 
The 1% Notes due 2035 are convertible, at the option of the holders at any time before the maturity date, into shares of the Company at a conversion rate of 26.8302 shares per one thousand dollars principal amount of the 1% Notes due 2035, representing a conversion price of approximately $37.27 per share.
 
Beginning on March 15, 2008 and until March 14, 2010, the Company may redeem for cash the notes, in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the redemption date, if the last reported sales price of the Company ordinary shares has exceeded 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30-day trading period ending on the trading day prior to the date of mailing of the notice of redemption.
 
At any time on or after March 15, 2010, the Company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the optional redemption date.
 
Holders of the notes have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes on March 15, 2010, March 15, 2015, March 15, 2020, March 15, 2025 and March 15, 2030.  The purchase price payable will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the purchase date.
 
In accordance with Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 14, (APBO 14), , the Company determined the existence of a substantial premium over par value for the 1% Notes due 2035 based upon quoted market prices at the msystems acquisition date and recorded the notes at par value with the resulting excess of fair value over par (the substantial premium) recorded in Capital in Excess of Par Value in Stockholders Equity in the amount of $26.4 million.

Concentrations of Risk and Segment Information
 
The Company markets and sells flash memory products in the U.S. and in foreign countries through its sales personnel, dealers, distributors, retailers and subsidiaries.  The Companys Chief Operating Decision Maker, the President and Chief Operating Officer, evaluates performance of the Company and makes decisions regarding allocation of resources based on total Company results.  Since the Company operates in one segment, all financial segment information can be found in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Geographic Information and Major Customers.  
 
Other than sales in the U.S., Japan, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia Pacific (APAC), international sales were not material individually in any other international locality.  Intercompany sales between geographic areas have been eliminated.
 
Information regarding geographic areas for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 
Revenues are attributed to countries based on the geographic location of the customers.  Long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic location in which they are located.  The Company includes in long-lived assets property and equipment, long-term investment in FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, and equity investments and attributes those investments to the location of the investees primary operations.  Amounts of long-lived assets related to Israel and Japan for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007 have been revised to properly reflect certain reclassifications.  The reclassifications did not have any effect on the total long-lived assets for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007.
 
F-24
A limited number of customers or licensees have accounted for a substantial portion of the Companys revenues.  Revenues from the Companys top 10 customers or licensees accounted for approximately 48%, 46% and 52% of the Companys revenues for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.  In fiscal year 2008, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) accounted for 13% of the Companys total revenues through a combination of license and royalty and product revenues.  All customers were less than 10% of the Companys total revenues in fiscal years 2007 and 2006.
Customer and Supplier Concentrations.  
 
All of the Companys flash memory card products require silicon wafers for the memory components and the controller components.  The Companys memory wafers or components are currently supplied almost entirely from Flash Partners Ltd., and Flash Alliance Ltd. (collectively Flash Ventures).  The Companys controller wafers are primarily manufactured by Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd., and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC).  The failure of any of these sources to deliver silicon wafers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, Toshibas employees that produce Flash Ventures products are covered by collective bargaining agreements and any strike or other job action by those employees could interrupt the Companys wafer supply from Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations.
 
In addition, key components are purchased from single source vendors for which alternative sources are currently not available.  Shortages could occur in these essential materials due to an interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry.  If the Company were unable to procure certain of such materials, it would be required to reduce its manufacturing operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations.  The Company also relies on third-party subcontractors to assemble and test a portion of its products.  The Company has no long-term contracts with these subcontractors and cannot directly control product delivery schedules or manufacturing processes.  This could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the manufacturing costs of its products and have material adverse effects on the Companys operating results.
 
The Companys concentration of credit risk consists principally of cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments and trade receivables.  The Companys investment policy restricts investments to high-credit quality investments and limits the amounts invested with any one issuer.  The Company sells to original equipment manufacturers, retailers and distributors in the U.S., Japan, EMEA and APAC, performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition, and generally requires no collateral.

Compensation and Benefits
 
Share-Based Benefit Plans
 
On May 27, 2005, the stockholders approved the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, which was amended in May 2006 and renamed the 2005 Incentive Plan (2005 Plan).  Shares of the Companys common stock may be issued under the 2005 Plan pursuant to three separate equity incentive programs: (i) the discretionary grant program under which stock options and stock appreciation rights may be granted to officers and other employees, non-employee board members and independent consultants, (ii) the stock issuance program under which shares may be awarded to such individuals through restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards or as a stock bonus for services rendered to the Company, and (iii) an automatic grant program for the non-employee board members pursuant to which such individuals will receive option grants or other stock awards at designated intervals over their period of board service.  The 2005 Plan also includes a performance-based cash bonus awards program for employees classified under Section 16.  Grants and awards under the discretionary grant program generally vest as follows: 25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% will vest proportionately each quarter over the next 36 months of continued service.  Awards under the stock issuance program generally vest in equal annual installments over a 4-year period.  Grants under the automatic grant program will vest in accordance with the specific vesting provisions set forth in that program.  A total of 22,222,931 shares of the Companys common stock have been reserved for issuance under this plan.  The share reserve may increase by up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock to the extent that outstanding options under the 1995 Stock Option Plan and the 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan expire or terminate unexercised, of which as of December 28, 2008, 1,522,931 shares of common stock has been added to the 2005 Plan reserve.  All options granted under the 2005 Plan were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and will expire seven years from the date of grant.
2005 Incentive Plan
.  
 
Both of these plans terminated on May 27, 2005, and no further option grants were made under the plans after that date.  However, options that were outstanding under these plans on May 27, 2005 will continue to be governed by their existing terms and may be exercised for shares of the Companys common stock at any time prior to the expiration of the ten-year option term or any earlier termination of those options in connection with the optionees cessation of service with the Company.  Grants and awards under these plans generally vest as follows: 25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% will vest proportionately each quarter over the next 36 months of continued service.
1995 Stock Option Plan and 1995 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.  
 
The 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) was approved by the stockholders on May 27, 2005.  The ESPP plan consists of two components: a component for employees residing in the U.S. and an international component for employees who are non-U.S. residents.  The ESPP plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at the end of each six-month offering period at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share on the start date of the offering period or the fair market value per share on the purchase date.  The ESPP plan had an original authorization of 5,000,000 shares to be issued, of which 3,392,848 shares were available to be issued as of December 28 2008.  In the fiscal years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, a total of 956,187, 385,989 and 264,976 shares of common stock, respectively, have been issued under this plan.

Adoption of SFAS 123(R)
 
Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS 123(R)), , using the modified-prospective transition method, and therefore, has not restated its financial statements for prior periods.  For awards expected to vest, compensation cost includes the following: (a) compensation cost, based on the grant-date estimated fair value and expense attribution method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), , related to any share-based awards granted through, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, and (b) compensation cost for any share-based awards granted on or subsequent to January 2, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123(R).  The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair values of these awards, which have graded vesting, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each of these awards, net of estimated forfeitures.

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
.
 
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing formula and a single-option award approach.  The Companys expected term represents the period that the Companys share-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience regarding similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share-based awards.  The Companys expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of its traded options in accordance with the guidance provided by the United States Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to place exclusive reliance on implied volatilities to estimate the Companys stock volatility over the expected term of its awards.  The Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to issue dividends.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with an equivalent term.
 
.  The fair value of the Companys stock options granted to employees, officers and non-employee board members and Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP) shares granted to employees for the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was estimated using the following weighted average assumptions:

Restricted stock units (RSUs) are converted into shares of the Companys common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis.  Typically, vesting of RSUs is subject to the employees continuing service to the Company.  The cost of these awards is determined using the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant, and compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period.

.  In the fourth quarter ended December 28, 2008, the Company initiated additional restructuring actions in an effort to better align its cost structure with business operation levels (Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan and Other).  Of the total costs accrued of $31.4 million, $10.4 million was related to severance and benefits for the involuntary termination of approximately 428 employees in all functions, primarily in the U.S., Israel and Spain.  Contract Termination Fees and Other Charges of $21.0 million included restructuring charges for marketing contract termination costs, technology license impairments, and fixed asset impairments related to outsourcing certain manufacturing activities.  In addition to the restructuring charge, contract termination fees and other charges include an accrual for unrelated litigation settlements.

The following table sets forth the activity in the accrued restructuring balances related to Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Plan and Other (in millions):
 
 
The Company anticipates that the remaining restructuring accrual balance of $20.3 million will be substantially paid out or utilized in fiscal year 2009.  The remaining restructuring accrual balance is reflected in Other Current Accrued Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Fiscal 2007 Restructuring Plan
 
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to better align its organizational workforce and close redundant facilities in order to reduce the Companys cost structure.  The Company incurred a total cost of $6.7 million, of which $6.0 million was related to involuntary termination of 149 employees in all functions in the U.S. and Israel.  Substantially all of the fiscal year 2007 restructuring plan was paid out in cash during fiscal year 2007.  The Company anticipates that the remaining accrued restructuring balance of $0.7 million will be substantially paid out in cash through the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, in connection with long-term facility leases.  The remaining restructuring accrual balance is reflected in Other Current Accrued Liabilities and Non-current Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Income Taxes
 
The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
 
Deferred federal income taxes includes taxes withheld on royalties and interest received of $79.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008.  Current foreign income taxes includes taxes withheld on royalties received of $66.5 million and $59.2 million for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.
 
Income (loss) before provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands):
 
The Companys provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rates to income (loss) before taxes as follows:
 
 
F-31
 
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax return reporting purposes.  Significant components of the Companys net deferred tax assets as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 were as follows (in thousands):
 
 
The Company has incurred a cumulative loss in recent years and determined in fiscal year 2008, based on all available evidence, that there was substantial uncertainty as to the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods.  A valuation allowance of $430.8 million and $67.4 million was provided on gross deferred tax assets at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively, based upon available evidence that it is not more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized.  The valuation allowance increased $363.4 million in fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007, due to the establishment of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. deferred tax assets, including tax credits, net operating losses and book/tax timing differences and certain foreign deferred tax assets.  The future release of the valuation allowance will benefit the provision for income taxes.  The fiscal year 2008 taxable loss in the U.S. can be carried back to prior years and a tax refund receivable of $241.7 million has been recorded due to federal and certain state net operating loss carryback claims.
 
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 enacted October 3, 2008 retroactively extended the research credit carryforward for the fiscal year 2008.  As a result, the generated credit of $2.7 million will be carried forward and is subject to a valuation allowance.
 
The Company has federal, state before federal benefit, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $87.6 million, $104.3 million and $175.0 million, respectively.  Some net operating losses will begin to expire in fiscal year 2011, if not utilized.  The Company also has federal and state research credit carryforwards of approximately $12.2 million and $18.0 million before federal benefit, respectively.  In addition, the Company has foreign tax credits of $124.4 million and alternative minimum tax credits of $1.1 million.  Some credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2013, if not utilized.  Some of these carryforwards are subject to annual limitations, including Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for U.S. tax purposes and similar state provisions.
 
F-32
 
No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on approximately $94.8 million of cumulative unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of December 28, 2008, since the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest these earnings outside the U.S.  If these earnings were distributed to the U.S., the Company would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes (subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits).  As of December 28, 2008, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $26.8 million.
 
The tax benefit (charge) associated with the exercise of stock options was applied to capital in excess of par value in the amount of ($3.9) million, $18.4 million and $61.5 million in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The tax benefit associated with the exercise of stock options credited to goodwill in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was zero, $0.6 million and $4.6 million, respectively.
 
The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), on January 1, 2007.  As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized an increase of approximately $1.0 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,
 
 
The total amount of unrecognized tax positions that would impact the effective tax rate is approximately $94.2 million at December 28, 2008.  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.  The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest and penalties of approximately $24.3 million, $9.7 million and $5.0 million at December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.  Tax expense for the years ended December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 included interest and penalties of $12.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively.  Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a net benefit for interest and penalties of $0.8 million.
 
It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $11.7 million within the next 12 months as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitation.  The Company is currently under audit by several tax authorities.  Because timing of the resolution and/or closure of these audits is highly uncertain it is not possible to estimate other changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for positions existing at December 28, 2008.
 
The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions.  The federal statute of limitations on assessment remains open for the tax years 2005 through 2007, and the statutes of limitation in state jurisdictions remain open in general from tax years 2002 through 2007.  The major foreign jurisdictions remain open for examination in general for tax years 2002 through 2007.

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):
 
Basic earnings (loss) per share exclude any dilutive effects of stock options, SARs, RSUs, warrants and convertible securities.  Fiscal years 2007 and 2006 diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effects of stock options, SARs, RSUs, warrants and the 1% Convertible Notes due 2035.  Certain common stock issuable under stock options, SARs, warrants and the 1% Senior Convertible Notes due 2013 were anti-dilutive for all fiscal years presented.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees
 
In June 2008, the Company agreed to wind-down its 49.9% ownership interest in FlashVision Ltd. (FlashVision), a business venture with Toshiba which owns 50.1%.  In this venture, the Company and Toshiba collaborated in the development and manufacture of 200-millimeter NAND flash memory products.  However, the Company and Toshiba have determined that production of NAND flash memory products utilizing 200-millimeter wafers is no longer cost effective relative to current and projected market prices for NAND flash memory.
FlashVision.  
 
As part of the ongoing wind-down of FlashVision, Toshiba agreed to purchase certain assets of FlashVision and has retired the existing master lease agreement between FlashVision and a consortium of financial institutions, thereby releasing the Company from its contingent indemnification obligation.  Due to the wind-down qualifying as a reconsideration event under FIN 46R the Company re-evaluated whether FlashVision is a variable interest entity and concluded that FlashVision is no longer a variable interest entity within the scope of FIN 46R.  In fiscal year 2008, the Company received distributions of $102.5 million relating to its investment in FlashVision.  At December 28, 2008, the Company had an investment in FlashVision of $64.0 million denominated in Japanese yen, offset by $43.3 million of cumulative translation adjustments recorded in accumulated OCI.  For discussion on impairment of the FlashVision investment, see Note 4, Balance Sheet Information - Notes Receivable and Investments in the Flash Ventures with Toshiba.

The Company accounts for its 49.9% ownership position in Flash Partners under the equity method of accounting.  The Company is committed to purchase its provided three-month forecast of Flash Partners NAND wafer supply, which generally equals 50% of the ventures output.  The Company is not able to estimate its total wafer purchase commitment obligation beyond its rolling three-month purchase commitment because the price is determined by reference to the future cost of producing the semiconductor wafers.  In addition, the Company is committed to fund 49.9% of Flash Partners costs to the extent that Flash Partners revenues from wafer sales to the Company and Toshiba are insufficient to cover these costs.
Flash Partners.

Flash Partners sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions (lessors) a portion of its tools and has entered into six equipment master lease agreements totaling 300.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $3.32 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008, of which 197.7 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $2.19 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008, was outstanding at December 28, 2008.  The Company and Toshiba have each guaranteed 50%, on a several basis, of Flash Partners obligations under the master lease agreements.  In addition, these master lease agreements are secured by the underlying equipment.  As of December 28, 2008, the amount of the Companys guarantee obligation of the Flash Partners master lease agreements, which reflects future payments and any lease adjustments, was 98.8 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $1.09 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008.  Certain lease payments are due quarterly and certain lease payments are due semi-annually, and are scheduled to be completed in stages through fiscal year 2013.  At each lease payment date, Flash Partners has the option of purchasing the tools from the lessors.  Flash Partners is obligated to insure the equipment, maintain the equipment in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations and comply with other customary terms to protect the leased assets.  The fair value of the Companys guarantee obligation of Flash Partners master lease agreements was not material at inception of each master lease.
Flash Partners.  
 
The master lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities.  In addition to containing customary events of default related to Flash Partners that could result in an acceleration of Flash Partners obligations, the master lease agreements contain an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to the Company as guarantor, including, among other things, the Companys failure to maintain a minimum shareholders equity of at least $1.51 billion, and its failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of BB- from Standard & Poors (S&P) or Moodys Corporation (Moodys), or a minimum corporate rating of BB+ from Rating & Investment Information, Inc. (R&I).  As of December 28, 2008, Flash Partners was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants.  While the Companys S&P credit rating was B, two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from S&P, the Companys R&I credit rating was BBB-, one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from R&I.  If R&I were to downgrade the Companys credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold, Flash Partners would become non-compliant under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non-compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements.  Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by the Company, as guarantor, or increased interest rates or waiver fees, should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances.  If a resolution were unsuccessful, the Company could be required to pay a portion or the entire outstanding lease obligations covered by its guarantee under such Flash Partners master lease agreements.
 
Flash Alliance sells and leases back from a consortium of financial institutions (lessors) a portion of its tools and has entered into two equipment master lease agreements totaling 200.0 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $2.21 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008, of which 181.1 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $2.00 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008, was outstanding as of December 28, 2008.  The Company and Toshiba have each guaranteed 50%, on a several basis, of Flash Alliances obligation under the master lease agreements.  In addition, these master lease agreements are secured by the underlying equipment.  As of December 28, 2008, the amount of the Companys guarantee obligation of the Flash Alliance master lease agreements was 90.6 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $1.0 billion based upon the exchange rate at December 28, 2008.  Remaining master lease payments are due semi-annually and are scheduled to be completed in fiscal year 2013.  At each lease payment date, Flash Alliance has the option of purchasing the tools from the lessors.

The master lease agreements contain customary covenants for Japanese lease facilities.  In addition to containing customary events of default related to Flash Alliance that could result in an acceleration of Flash Alliances obligations, the master lease agreements contain an acceleration clause for certain events of default related to the Company as guarantor, including, among other things, the Companys failure to maintain a minimum shareholders equity of at least $1.51 billion, and its failure to maintain a minimum corporate rating of BB- from S&P or Moodys or a minimum corporate rating of BB+ from R&I.  As of December 28, 2008, Flash Alliance was in compliance with all of its master lease covenants.  While the Companys S&P credit rating was B, two levels below the required minimum corporate rating threshold from S&P, the Companys R&I credit rating was BBB-, one level above the required minimum corporate rating threshold from R&I.  If R&I were to downgrade the Companys credit rating below the minimum corporate rating threshold, Flash Alliance would become non-compliant under its master equipment lease agreements and would be required to negotiate a resolution to the non-compliance to avoid acceleration of the obligations under such agreements.  Such resolution could include, among other things, supplementary security to be supplied by the Company, as guarantor, or increased interest rates or waiver fees, should the lessors decide they need additional collateral or financial consideration under the circumstances.  If a resolution were unsuccessful, the Company could be required to pay a portion or the entire outstanding lease obligations covered by its guarantee under such Flash Alliance master lease agreements.

Guarantees
 
The Company has agreed to indemnify suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement.  The scope of such indemnity varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys fees.  The Company may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations.  The Companys insurance policies exclude coverage for third-party claims for patent infringement.  Although the liability is not remote, the nature of the patent infringement indemnification obligations prevents the Company from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount it could be required to pay to its suppliers and customers.  Historically, the Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under any such agreements.  As of December 28, 2008, no amount had been accrued in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.
Indemnification Agreements.  
 
As permitted under Delaware law and the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the Company has agreements, or has assumed agreements in connection with its acquisitions, whereby it indemnifies certain of its officers, employees, and each of its directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer, employee or director is, or was, serving at the Companys or the acquired companys request in such capacity.  The term of the indemnification period is for the officers, employees or directors lifetime.  The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is generally unlimited; however, the Company has a Director and Officer insurance policy that may reduce its exposure and enable it to recover all or a portion of any future amounts paid.  As a result of its insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal.  The Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December 28, 2008 or December 30, 2007, as these liabilities are not reasonably estimable even though liabilities under these agreements are not remote.
 
The Company and Toshiba have agreed to mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and Flash Ventures for environmental remediation costs or liability resulting from Flash Ventures manufacturing operations in certain circumstances.  The Company and Toshiba have also entered into a Patent Indemnification Agreement under which in many cases the Company will share in the expenses associated with the defense and cost of settlement associated with such claims.  This agreement provides limited protection for the Company against third party claims that NAND flash memory products manufactured and sold by Flash Ventures infringes third party patents.  The Company has not made any indemnification payments under any such agreements and as of December 28, 2008, no amounts have been accrued in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.

Related Parties and Strategic Investments
 
The Company and Toshiba have collaborated in the development and manufacture of NAND flash memory products.  These NAND flash memory products are manufactured by Toshiba at Toshibas Yokkaichi, Japan operations using the semiconductor manufacturing equipment owned or leased by FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance.  See also Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.  The Company purchased NAND flash memory wafers from FlashVision, Flash Partners, Flash Alliance and Toshiba, made payments for shared research and development expenses, made loans to FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance and made investments in FlashVision, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance totaling approximately $2,038.6 million, $1,294.5 million and $658.4 million in the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.  The purchases of NAND flash memory wafers are ultimately reflected as a component of the Companys cost of product revenues.  During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, the Company had sales to Toshiba (excluding TwinSys as described in Note 13, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) of $5.1 million, compared to $26.7 million in the prior year.  At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, the Company had accounts payable balances due to Toshiba of zero and $0.2 million, respectively, and accounts receivable balances from Toshiba of $2.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively.

Business Acquisitions
 
On November 19, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of msystems in an all stock transaction.  This combination joined together two flash memory companies with complementary products, customers and channels.  The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), .  The purchase price was comprised of the following (in thousands):
msystems Ltd.
 
Business Combinations
 
 
As a result of the acquisition, the Company issued approximately 29.4 million shares of SanDisk common stock based on an exchange ratio of 0.76368 shares of the Companys common stock for each outstanding share of msystems common stock as of November 19, 2006.  The average market price per share of SanDisk common stock of $46.48 was based on the average of the closing prices for a range of trading days around the announcement date (July 30, 2006) of the proposed transaction.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, each msystems stock option and stock appreciation right outstanding and unexercised as of November 19, 2006 was converted into a stock option and stock appreciation right (SARs), to purchase the Companys common stock.  Based on msystems stock options outstanding at November 19, 2006, the Company assumed msystems options and SARs to purchase approximately 5.4 million shares of the Companys common stock.  The fair value of options and SARs assumed was estimated using a valuation model with the following assumptions:
 
 
Direct transaction costs of approximately $15 million included investment banking, legal and accounting fees, and other external costs directly related to the acquisition.  As of December 28, 2008, all costs for accounting, legal and other professional services had been paid.
 
.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company established its plans to integrate themsystems operations, which included the involuntary termination of approximately 100 employees and the exiting of duplicative facilities, and recorded $1.6 million for acquisition-related restructuring activities, of which $0.3 million related to excess lease obligations and $1.3 million related to personnel.  These acquisition-related restructuring liabilities were included in the purchase price allocation of the cost to acquire msystems.  As of December 28, 2008, there was no remaining acquisition-related restructuring accrual that had not been paid or utilized.
Acquisition-Related Restructuring
 
 
As part of the msystems purchase agreement, a certain amount of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in-process technology, which was determined through established valuation techniques in the high-technology industry and written-off in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed.  The value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values.  The Company wrote-off the acquired in-process technology of $186.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  As of December 28, 2008, it was estimated that these in-process projects would be completed at an estimated total cost of $3.5 million.  The net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenues, costs of revenues, research and development expenses, including costs to complete the projects, selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and income taxes from the projects.  The Company believes the assumptions used in the valuations were reasonable at the time of the acquisition.  The estimated net revenues and gross margins were based on managements projections of the projects and were in line with industry averages.  Estimated total net revenues from the projects were expected to grow through fiscal year 2009 and decline thereafter as other new products are expected to become available.  Estimated operating expenses included research and development expenses and selling, marketing and administrative expenses based upon historical and expected direct expense level and general industry metrics.  Estimated research and development expenses included costs to bring the projects to technological feasibility and costs associated with ongoing maintenance after a product is released, estimated at 2% of the expected net revenues for the in-process technologies.
In-process Technology.  
 
The effective tax rate used in the analysis of the in-process technologies reflected a historical industry-specific average for the United States federal income tax rates.  A discount rate (the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values) of 19% was used in computing the present value of net cash flows for the projects.  The percentage of completion was determined using costs incurred by prior to the acquisition date compared to the estimated remaining research and development to be completed to bring the projects to technological feasibility.

On January 13, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of Matrix, a designer and developer of three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits.  Matrix 3D Memory is used for one-time programmable storage applications that complement the Companys existing flash storage memory products.  The Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Matrix for a total purchase price of $296.4 million.  The purchase price was comprised of the following (in thousands):
Matrix Semiconductor, Inc.
 
 
 
As a result of the acquisition, the Company issued approximately 3.7 million shares of SanDisk common stock and assumed equity instruments to issue 567,704 shares of common stock.  The assumed stock options were valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model with the following assumptions: stock price of $65.09; a weighted average volatility rate of 52.8%; a risk-free interest rate of 4.3%; a dividend yield of zero and a weighted average expected remaining term of 1.4 years.  The fair value of unvested assumed stock options, which was valued at the consummation date, is being recognized as compensation expense, net of forfeitures, over the remaining vesting period.
 
.  During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company established its plans to integrate theMatrix operations, which included exiting duplicative facilities and recording $17.5 million for acquisition-related restructuring activities, of which $17.4 million related to excess lease obligations.  The lease obligations extend through the end of the lease term in fiscal year 2016.  These acquisition-related restructuring liabilities were included in the purchase price allocation of the cost to acquire Matrix.  As of December 28, 2008, the outstanding accrual balance was $12.7 million related to these long-term lease obligations.
Acquisition-Related Restructuring
 
 
As part of the Matrix purchase agreement, a certain amount of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in-process technology, which was determined through established valuation techniques in the high-technology computer industry and written-off in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed.  The value was determined by estimating the net cash flows and discounting forecasted net cash flows to their present values.  The Company wrote-off the acquired in-process technology of $39.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006.  As of December 28, 2008, all in-process projects were completed.
In-process Technology.  
 
The net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenues, costs of revenues, research and development expenses, including costs to complete the projects, selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and income taxes from the projects.  The Company believes the assumptions used in the valuations were reasonable at the time of the acquisition.  The estimated net revenues and gross margins were based on managements projections of the projects and were in line with industry averages.  Estimated total net revenues from the projects were expected to grow through fiscal year 2009 and decline thereafter as other new products are expected to become available.  Estimated operating expenses included research and development expenses and selling, marketing and administrative expenses based upon historical and expected direct expense level and general industry metrics.  Estimated research and development expenses included costs to bring the projects to technological feasibility and costs associated with ongoing maintenance after a product is released.  These activities range from 0% to 5% of Matrixs portion of the Companys net revenues for the in-process technologies.
 
The effective tax rate used in the analysis of the in-process technologies reflected a historical industry-specific average for the United States federal income tax rates.  Discount rates (the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values) ranging from 12.5% to 15.5% were used in computing the present value of net cash flows for the projects.  The percentage of completion was determined using costs incurred by Matrix prior to the acquisition date compared to the estimated remaining research and development to be completed to bring the projects to technological feasibility.
 
The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 presents the combined results of the Company, Matrix and msystems, as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the period presented (in thousands, except per share amounts).

Note 16: 
Stockholders Rights Plan
 
On September 15, 2003, the Company amended its existing stockholder rights plan to terminate the rights issued under that rights plan, and the Company adopted a new rights plan.  Under the new rights plan, rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common stock of the Company held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 25, 2003.  In November 2006, the Company extended the term of the rights plan, such that the rights will expire on April 28, 2017 unless redeemed or exchanged.  Under the new rights agreement and after giving effect to the Companys stock dividend effected on February 18, 2004, each right will, under the circumstances described below, entitle the registered holder to buy one two-hundredths of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $225.00.  The rights will become exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Companys common stock or commences a tender offer or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own 15% or more of the Companys common stock.

Note 17: 
Litigation
 
The flash memory industry is characterized by significant litigation seeking to enforce patent and other intellectual property rights.  The Company's patent and other intellectual property rights are primarily responsible for generating license and royalty revenue.  The Company seeks to protect its intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and other methods, and has been, and likely will, continue to enforce such rights as appropriate through litigation and related proceedings.  The Company expects that its competitors and others who hold intellectual property rights related to its industry will pursue similar strategies against it in litigation and related proceedings.  From time-to-time, it has been and may continue to be necessary to initiate or defend litigation against third parties.  These and other parties could bring suit against the Company.  In each case listed below where the Company is the defendant, the Company intends to vigorously defend the action.  At this time, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that losses related to the litigation described below have occurred beyond the amounts, if any, that have been accrued.
 
On October 15, 2004, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement and declaratory judgment of non-infringement and patent invalidity against STMicroelectronics N.V. and STMicroelectronics, Inc. (collectively, ST) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned SanDisk Corporation v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., et al., Civil Case No. C 04 04379 JF.  The complaint alleges that STs products infringe one of the Companys U.S. patents, U.S. Patent No. 5,172,338 (the 338 patent), and also alleges that several of STs patents are invalid and not infringed.  On June 18, 2007, the Company filed an amended complaint, removing several of the Companys declaratory judgment claims.  At a case management conference conducted on June 29, 2007, the parties agreed that the remaining declaratory judgment claims would be dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement in two matters being litigated in the Eastern District of Texas (Civil Case No. 4:05CV44 and Civil Case No. 4:05CV45, discussed below).  The parties also agreed that the 338 patent and a second Company patent, presently at issue in Civil Case No. C0505021 JF (discussed below), will be litigated together in this case.  ST filed an answer and counterclaims on September 6, 2007.  STs counterclaims included assertions of antitrust violations.  On October 19, 2007, the Company filed a motion to dismiss STs antitrust counterclaims.  On December 20, 2007, the Court entered a stipulated order staying all procedural deadlines until the Court resolves the Companys motion to dismiss.   At a hearing held on January 25, 2008, the Court converted the Companys motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.  On June 17, 2008, the Court issued a stipulated order rescheduling the hearing on the Companys motion for summary judgment for September 12, 2008.  On October 17, 2008, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Companys motion for summary judgment on STs antitrust counterclaims.  The Court has not yet established new procedural deadlines in this matter.
On October 14, 2005, STMicroelectronics, Inc. (STMicro) filed a complaint against the Company and the Companys CEO, Dr. Eli Harari, in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Alameda, captioned STMicroelectronics, Inc. v. Harari, Case No. HG 05237216 (the Harari Matter).  The complaint alleges that STMicro, as the successor to Wafer Scale Integration, Inc.s (WSI) legal rights, has an ownership interest in several Company patents that were issued from applications filed by Dr. Harari, a former WSI employee.  The complaint seeks the assignment or co-ownership of certain inventions and patents conceived of by Dr. Harari, including some of the patents asserted by the Company in its litigations against STMicro, as well as damages in an unspecified amount.  On November 15, 2005, Dr. Harari and the Company removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, where it was assigned case number C05-04691.  On December 13, 2005, STMicro filed a motion to remand the case back to the Superior Court of Alameda County.  The case was remanded to the Superior Court of Alameda County on July 18, 2006, after briefing and oral argument on a motion by STMicro for reconsideration of an earlier order denying STMicros request for remand.  Due to the remand, the District Court did not rule upon a summary judgment motion previously filed by the Company.  In the Superior Court of Alameda County, the Company filed a Motion to Transfer Venue to Santa Clara County on August 10, 2006, which was denied on September 12, 2006.  On October 6, 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate with the First District Court of Appeal, which asked that the Superior Courts September 12, 2006 Order be vacated, and the case transferred to Santa Clara County.  On October 20, 2006, the Court of Appeal requested briefing on the Companys petition for a writ of mandate and stayed the action during the pendency of the writ proceedings.  On January 17, 2007, the Court of Appeal issued an alternative writ directing the Superior Court to issue a new order granting the Companys venue transfer motion or to show cause why a writ of mandate should not issue compelling such an order.  On January 23, 2007, the Superior Court of Alameda transferred the case to Santa Clara County as a result of the writ proceeding at the Court of Appeal.  The Company also filed a special motion to strike STMicros unfair competition claim, which the Superior Court denied on September 11, 2006.  The Company appealed the denial of that motion, and the proceedings at the Superior Court were stayed during the pendency of the appeal.  On August 7, 2007, the First District Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Courts decision, and the Supreme Court subsequently denied the Companys petition for review.  On February 7, 2008, the Company and Dr. Harari moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the claims in the case.  The Superior Court denied this motion and litigation then proceeded at the Superior Court until May 7, 2008, when the Company and Dr. Harari again removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The District Court consolidated the case and the previously-removed action under case number C05-04691.  STMicro filed a motion to remand which was granted on August 26, 2008.  The case was remanded to the Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara, Case No. 1-07-CV-080123, and trial has been set for September 8, 2009.  On January 30, 2009, the Company and Dr. Harari filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that STMicros claims are time-barred.  The motion for summary judgment is scheduled to be heard on April 27, 2009.

On December 6, 2005, the Company filed a complaint for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against ST (Case No. C0505021 JF).  In the suit, the Company seeks damages and injunctions against ST from making, selling, importing or using flash memory chips or products that infringe the Companys U.S. Patent No. 5,991,517 (the 517 patent).  As discussed above, the 517 patent will be litigated together with the 338 patent in Civil Case No. C 04 04379JF.
 
On September 11, 2006, Mr. Rabbi, a shareholder of msystems Ltd. (msystems), a company subsequently acquired by the Company in or about November 2006, filed a derivative action in Israel and a motion to permit him to file the derivative action against msystems and four directors of msystems arguing that options were allegedly allocated to officers and employees of msystems in violation of applicable law.  Mr. Rabbi claimed that the aforementioned actions allegedly caused damage to msystems.  On January 25, 2007, SanDisk IL Ltd. (SDIL), successor in interest to msystems, filed a motion to dismiss the motion to seek leave to file the derivative action and the derivative action on the grounds, inter alia, that Mr. Rabbi ceased to be a shareholder of msystems after the merger between msystems and the Company.  On March 12, 2008, the court granted SDILs motion and dismissed the motion to seek leave to file the derivative action and consequently, the derivative action itself was dismissed.  On May 15, 2008, Mr. Rabbi filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Israel, the hearing of which is set for March 19, 2009.

Between August 31, 2007 and December 14, 2007, the Company (along with a number of other manufacturers of flash memory products) was sued in the Northern District of California, in eight purported class action complaints.  On February 7, 2008, all of the civil complaints were consolidated into two complaints, one on behalf of direct purchasers and one on behalf of indirect purchasers, in the Northern District of California in a purported class action captioned In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litigation, Civil Case No. C07-0086.  Plaintiffs allege the Company and a number of other manufacturers of flash memory products conspired to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of NAND flash memory in violation of state and federal laws.  The lawsuits purport to be on behalf of purchasers of flash memory between January 1, 1999 through the present.  The lawsuits seek an injunction, damages, restitution, fees, costs, and disgorgement of profits.  On April 8, 2008, the Company, along with co-defendants, filed motions to dismiss the direct purchaser and indirect purchaser complaints.  Also on April 8, 2008, the Company, along with co-defendants, filed a motion for a protective order to stay discovery.  On April 22, 2008, direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs filed oppositions to the motions to dismiss.  The Companys, along with co-defendants, reply to the oppositions was filed May 13, 2008.  The Court took the motions to dismiss and the motion for a protective order under submission on June 3, 2008, and has yet to issue its ruling.
 
On November 6, 2007, Gil Mosek, a former employee of SanDisk IL Ltd. (SDIL), filed a lawsuit against SDIL, Dov Moran and Amir Ban in the Tel-Aviv District Court, claiming that he and Amir Ban, another former employee of SDIL, reached an agreement according to which a jointly-held company should have been established together with SDIL. According to Mr. Mosek, SDIL knew about the agreement, approved it and breached it, while deciding not to establish the jointly-held company.  On January 1, 2008, SDIL filed a statement of defense. Simultaneously, SDIL filed a request to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that Mr. Mosek signed a waiver in favor of SDIL, according to which he has no claim against SDIL.  On February 12, 2008, Mr. Mosek filed a request to allow him to present certain documents, which contain confidential information of SDIL.  On February 26, 2008, SDIL opposed this request, claiming that SDILs documents are the sole property of SDIL and Mr. Mosek has no right to hold and to use them.  On March 6, 2008, the court decided that Mr. Mosek has to pay a fee according to the estimated amount of the claim.  On April 3, 2008, Mr. Mosek filed a request to amend the claim by setting the claim on an amount of NIS 3,000,000.  On April 9, 2008, SDIL filed its response to this request, according to which it has no objection to the amendment, subject to the issuance of an order for costs.  On April 10, 2008, the Court accepted Mr. Moseks request.  According to the settlement agreement, reached between the SDIL and Amir Ban in January 2008, Amir Ban shall indemnify and hold SDIL harmless with regard to the claim filed by Mosek, as described in this section above.  At a pre-trial hearing held on February 9, 2009, the Court indicated that Mr. Mosek should transfer his claim to the Tel-Aviv Labor Court due to the District Courts lack of jurisdiction.  Mr. Mosek asked for the Court's permission to divide the lawsuit into two parts so the action against Amir Ban may be transferred to the Labor Court whereas the claim against SDIL would remain in the District Court.  The District Court has not yet ruled as to whether the portion of the claim against Amir Ban should be transferred to the Labor Court together with the claim against SDIL.
 
In April 2006, the Company's subsidiary SanDisk IL Ltd. (SDIL) terminated its supply and license agreement (the Agreement) with Samsung.  As a result of this termination, the Companys subsidiary no longer was entitled to purchase products on favorable pricing terms from Samsung, Samsung no longer had a life-of-patent license to the Companys subsidiarys patents, and no further patent licensing payments would be due.  Samsung contested the termination and SDIL commenced an arbitration proceeding seeking a declaration that its termination was valid.

On September 22, 2008, Samsung withdrew its petition for vacatur and asked the Court to immediately enter judgment against itself with respect to SDIL's petition to confirm.  On September 24, 2008, the Court entered judgment in favor of SDIL on SDIL's petition to confirm the award.  On October 7, 2008, SDIL filed a motion for attorneys fees and expenses incurred in connection with Samsung's withdrawn petition to vacate the award.  On October 20, 2008, after Samsung offered to pay in full the expenses claimed by SDIL, the motion for attorneys fees and expenses was denied by the District Court.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 22, 2009, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its second quarter ended June 28, 2009.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and economic non-cash interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and economic non-cash interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Milpitas, CA, July 22, 2009 - SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the global leader in flash memory cards, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 28, 2009.  Total second quarter revenue of $731 million declined 10% on a year-over-year basis and increased 11% on a sequential basis.  Net income, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), was $53 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of ($74) million or ($0.33) per share in the second quarter of 2008 and GAAP net loss of ($208) million, or ($0.92) per share in the first quarter of 2009.
 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense, and economic non-cash interest expense associated with the cash-settled convertible note, the second-quarter net income was $83 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($22) million or ($0.10) per share in the second quarter of 2008 and net loss of ($108) million or ($0.48) per share in the first quarter of 2009.  For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
We are very pleased with our return to profitability in the second quarter, driven by increased pricing, higher royalty revenue, and strong execution.

In the second quarter we renewed our patent cross license agreement with Samsung Electronics, providing market certainty.  We remain cautiously optimistic about the second half of 2009.

On August 4, 2009, the Board of Directors of SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) appointed Kevin DeNuccio and Chenming Hu to its Board of Directors (the Board).
There are no relationships or related transactions between the Registrant and each of Mr. DeNuccio and Dr. Hu that would be required to be reported under Section 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  In connection with the appointment of Mr. DeNuccio and Dr. Hu to the Board, they will be compensated in accordance with the Registrants compensation arrangements for its non-employee Board members. The Registrant entered into indemnification agreements with each of Mr. DeNuccio and Dr. Hu, the terms of which are identical in all material respects to the form of indemnification agreement that the Registrant has previously entered into with each of its directors and the form of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Registrants Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 33-96298).
 
On August 4, 2009, the Board approved an amendment to Article III, Section 1 of the Registrants Amended and Restated Bylaws to increase the size of the Board from eight to nine members. A copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Registrant is filed herewith as Exhibit 3.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.

Section 11.
 
 
 
 
  Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation, not less than eighty (80) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the meeting is not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders.

(f) any material interest of the stockholder in such business. Notwithstanding anything in the bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 of the bylaws. The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13 of the bylaws, and if he/she should so determine, he/she shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 13.
 
 
 
 
  Subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nominations for the election of directors may be made by the Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors or by any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally.  However, any stockholder entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if written notice of such stockholders intent to make such nomination or nominations has been received by the secretary of the corporation not less than 80 days in advance of such meeting; provided however, that in the event that the date of the meeting was not publicly announced by the corporation by mail, press release or otherwise more than 90 days prior to the meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the secretary of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the meeting was communicated to stockholders. Each such notice shall set forth:

(e) The consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected.

Section 1.
 
  Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, except that in the event a director is removed by the stockholders for cause, the stockholders shall be entitled to fill the vacancy created as a result of such removal. The directors so chosen shall serve for the remainder of the term of the vacated directorships being filled and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.
Section 2.

In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected Board of Directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.

A written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time of the meeting stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Section 7.
 
  At all meetings of the board a majority of the then existing directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

The chairman of any meeting shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting.
Section 9.
 
  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing, and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
Section 10.
 
  Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
Section 11.
 
 
 
  The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.
Section 12.
 
In the absence of disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he/she or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.
 
 
 
 
Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to amending the certificate of incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or consolidation, recommending to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporations property and assets, recommending to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or amending the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the resolution or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock.

No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Section 14.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 20, 2009, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended September 27, 2009.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the cash-settled convertible note, third-quarter net income was $176 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($132) million or ($0.59) per share in the third quarter of 2008 and net income of $83 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.

(1)  
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Company.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses we recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with our cash-settled convertible debt, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in our financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing our performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with our cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 28, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2010.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, msystems Ltd. in November 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, the impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Milpitas, CA, January 28, 2010 - SanDiskCorporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the global leader in flash memory cards, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 3, 2010.  Total fourth quarter revenue of $1.24 billion increased 44% on a year-over-year basis and increased 33% sequentially.  Total revenue for fiscal 2009 of $3.57 billion increased 6% from $3.35 billion in fiscal 2008.
 
Fourth quarter net income, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), was $340 million, or earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($1.76) billion, or ($7.78) per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and net income of $231 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  The GAAP net income for fiscal 2009 was $415 million, or $1.79 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($1.99) billion, or ($8.82) per share, in fiscal 2008.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of acquisition-related charges, share-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the cash-settled convertible note, and related tax adjustments and valuation allowance, fourth-quarter net income was $277 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($359) million, or ($1.59) per share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and net income of $176 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  The non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2009 was $427 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared to net loss of ($466) million, or ($2.07) per share, in fiscal 2008.  For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
We delivered a terrific fourth quarter in 2009  our best performance ever in product revenue, profit and cash flow.  These results demonstrate the success of the actions that we took this past year, including restructuring our captive supply and diversifying our OEM and retail channels that resulted in unit sales growth of 55% and gigabyte growth of 100% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.  Product gross margin was sharply higher due to continued strong cost reductions and stable pricing, said Eli Harari, Chairman and CEO, SanDisk. In 2010, we look forward to solid growth in our markets with a continued emphasis on profitability.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business prospects and outlook, our expectations for fiscal year 2010 and our expectations regarding our business, including our retail and OEM businesses, and continued cost reductions, that are based on our current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others:
competitive pricing pressures, resulting in lower average selling prices and lower or negative product gross margins;
expansion of supply from existing competitors and ourselves creating excess market supply, causing our average selling prices to decline faster than our costs;
unpredictable or changing demand for our products, particularly for certain form factors or capacities;
excess captive memory output or capacity which could result in write-downs for excess inventory, lower of cost or market reserves, fixed costs associated with under-utilized capacity, or other consequences;
inability to maintain or grow sales through our new channels to which we are selling private label products, wafers and components or potential loss of branded product sales as a result;
insufficient non-memory materials or capacity from our suppliers and contract manufacturers to meet demand; or increases in cost of non-memory materials or capacity;
less than anticipated demand, including due to economic weakness in our markets; and
other risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 27, 2009.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On April 21, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its first quarter ended April 4, 2010.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
   
 
On July 13, 2010, SanDisk Corporation, or SanDisk, entered into a transaction with Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba, under which SanDisk and Toshiba created a to be named new semiconductor company, a Japanese , owned 49.9% by SanDisk and 50.1% by Toshiba (New Flash Venture), and agreed to cooperate in the equipping of a new 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication operation, within Toshibas Fab 5, where New Flash Venture will produce NAND flash memory products for the parties. Toshiba will own and fund the construction of the Fab 5 building, which will be located in Yokkaichi, Japan, adjacent to the site of the parties current Flash Partners and Flash Alliance ventures.  Both parties will initially share in the cost of the manufactu ring equipment as well as startup costs, which costs are expected to be substantial, and depreciation of the Fab 5 building will be a component of the cost per wafer charged to each party.  With the creation of the new venture, SanDisk and Toshiba are further expanding their long business relationship.  In 2004, and again in 2006, SanDisk and Toshiba formed ventures, Flash Partners and Flash Alliance, respectively, to equip 300-millimeter NAND wafer fabrication facilities and to operate the facilities and supply wafers to each of SanDisk and Toshiba.  Previously, in 2000, Toshiba and SanDisk formed and operated a 200-millimeter NAND flash venture, FlashVision, which concluded operations in 2008.

Fab 5 has been designed to be built in two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2, each of which is expected to be of approximately equal size.  Including both phases, Fab 5 will be of similar size and capacity to Toshibas existing Fab 4, within which SanDisk and Toshiba operate their Flash Alliance venture.  The Phase 1 building shell is expected to be completed in the second quarter of calendar year 2011 after which equipment outfitting is expected to begin.  First output from Phase 1 is expected in the third quarter of calendar year 2011.  SanDisk expects that Fab 5 will increase its 2011 wafer output by less than 10%.  SanDisk is committed to 50% of the initial ramp within Phase 1 of Fab 5, and this initial commitment is expected to result in equipment investments and start-up costs of approximately $500 million through 2011.  There will be no material impact on SanDisks 2010 capital investments.  SanDisk will also provide a cash prepayment of approximately $56 million in 2011 to be credited against future charges.  No commitments or timelines have been finalized for any further Phase 1 capacity expansions or for the construction of Phase 2.  For expansion beyond the initial commitment, SanDisk has the option to make investments and share output on a 50/50 basis between SanDisk and Toshiba.  SanDisk expects to fund its portion of the investment through its cash as well as other financing sources.  If and when Phase 2 is built, SanDisk is committed to an initial ramp in Phase 2 similar to that in Phase 1.
Each party will retain some flexibility as to the extent and timing of its participation in any Fab 5 capacity expansion, and the output allocation will be in accordance with each of the parties proportional level of equipment funding.  As long as SanDisk maintains a relatively low threshold of the Fab 5 capacity, SanDisk will benefit from equal wafer costs with Toshiba.  If SanDisk falls below that threshold of the Fab 5 capacity, SanDisk would be responsible for a portion of certain fixed costs of Fab 5s operations so long as SanDisks portion of the Fab 5 capacity remains below that threshold.
In connection with the Fab 5 transaction, Toshiba and SanDisk entered into a Master Agreement and other  agreements, each dated as of July 13, 2010, with certain additional ancillary agreements including an Operating Agreement, to be finalized as soon as practicable, that set forth the provisions governing the business of the new venture.  The Master Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which Toshiba and SanDisk have agreed to establish a venture to collaborate in the development and manufacture of NAND flash memory products in Fab 5.  These NAND flash memory products will be manufactured by Toshiba at Fab 5 using semiconductor manufacturing equipment that will be owned or leased by New Flash Venture.  The new venture will purchase wafers from Toshiba and then resell those wafer s to SanDisk and Toshiba.  The Operating Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions governing the conduct of New Flash Ventures affairs and the rights, powers, preferences, limitations and responsibilities of its members and employees.  The parties will continue their existing joint technology development in advanced NAND and 3D read/write memory.
In addition to the agreements described above, SanDisk and Toshiba also entered into a Patent Indemnification Agreement and a Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement.  The Patent Indemnification Agreement provides for certain rights and obligations of each party for claims that flash memory products, if any, sold by New Flash Venture infringe third-party patents.  Under the Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement, the parties have agreed to mutually contribute to, and indemnify each other and New Flash Venture for, certain environmental remediation costs or liabilities resulting from each partys share of Fab 5 manufacturing operations.
Toshiba and SanDisk also entered into a Transition Agreement applicable to New Flash Venture.  The Transition Agreement provides that if there is a change in control of SanDisk involving any of a very limited number of named companies, which named companies may be changed by Toshiba periodically, Toshiba has the option to buy out SanDisks interests in New Flash Venture.  The buy out option can be exercised only for a limited period of time after the change in control.  Under the buy out option, Toshiba can either (i) purchase SanDisks full interest in Fab 5 immediately, under a certain pricing methodology, in which case SanDisk has the right to purchase continued wafer supply for a limited period of time after the change in control, or (ii) purchase SanDisks interest in Fab 5 over a spec ified period of time, under a different pricing methodology, in which case SanDisk has the right (and to some extent, the obligation) to purchase continued wafer supply for a certain period of time after the change in control.  Under this Transition Agreement, if it were to become operative, SanDisks right to continue to purchase wafer supply would approximate its pre-change in control purchase volumes, for a period of time.
The above descriptions of the terms of the Master Agreement, Operating Agreement, Patent Indemnification Agreement, Mutual Contribution and Environmental Indemnification Agreement and Transition Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the text of these agreements, which SanDisk intends to file as exhibits to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending October 3, 2010.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 22, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its second quarter ended July 4, 2010.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible debt, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible debt, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Covenants of the Underwriters
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any electronic roadshow or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly
Indemnity and Contribution
 
for use therein. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any issuer free writing prospectus used by the Underwriters in violation of Section 7 hereof.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule III hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein (other than with respect to Section 8(a) in cases in which Section 8(b) is applicable), then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were
 
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
Termination
 
     10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Firm Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Firm Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such principal amount of Firm Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate number of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so
 
terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     11. . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
     (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
     12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

Upon the issuance of any substituted Note, the Company or the Trustee may require the payment by the holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Note which has matured or is about to mature or has been tendered for repurchase upon a Designated Event or is about to be converted into Common Stock shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent or Conversion Agent evidence of their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, all Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
          Section 2.08. . Pending the preparation of Notes in certificated form, the Company may execute and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall, upon written request of the Company, authenticate and deliver temporary Notes (printed or lithographed). Temporary Notes shall be issuable in any authorized denomination, and

Every such temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee or such authenticating agent upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the Notes in certificated form. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee or such authenticating agent Notes in certificated form (other than in the case of Notes in global form) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes (other than any Global Note) may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 3.02 and the Trustee or such authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes in certificated form. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as Notes in certificated form authenticated and delivered hereunder.
          Section 2.09. . All Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment, repurchase, conversion, exchange or registration of transfer, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any Paying Agent or any Note Registrar or any Conversion Agent, be surrendered to the Trustee and promptly canceled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly canceled by it, and no Notes shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of canceled Notes in accordance with its customary procedures and, after such destruction, shall deliver a certificate confirming such disposal to the Company, at the Company's written request. If the Company shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Notes Paid, Etc
          Section 2.10. . The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in Company Notices as a convenience to holders of the Notes; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or Company Notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes.

     (h) the Company shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; or

The Company shall notify the Responsible Officer of the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

          Section 5.06. . Except as provided in the last paragraph of Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article V to the Trustee or to the Noteholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein; and, subject to the provisions of Section 5.04, every power and remedy given by this Article V or by law to the Trustee or to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Noteholders.
Remedies Cumulative and Continuing
          Section 5.07. . The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to Notes; , , that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. The Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that it determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04 may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes waive any past default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in the payment of and accrued and unpaid interest on, or the principal of, the Notes when due which has not been cured pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.01, (ii) a failure by the Company to deliver cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) upon conversion of the Notes, or (iii) a default in respect of a covenant or provisions hereof which under Article IX cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of an outstanding Note affected thereby. Upon any such waiver the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by this Section 5.07, said default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

     (i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.08 within a reasonable time after written request therefor by the Company or by any Noteholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least six (6) months, or

Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
     (c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, as determined in accordance with Section 7.04, may at any time remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee which shall be deemed appointed as successor trustee unless within ten (10) days after notice to the Company of such nomination the Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so removed or any Noteholder, upon the terms and conditions and otherwise as in Section 6.10(a) provided, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.
     (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 6.11.

Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property and funds held or collected by such trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for the benefit of holders of particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.06.
Acceptance by Successor Trustee
 
     No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.08 and be eligible under the provisions of Section 6.09.

then, in either case, holders may surrender the Notes for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company provides notice to holders referred to in the next sentence until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. The Company shall notify holders of any distribution referred to in either clause (i) or clause (ii) above and of the resulting conversion right no later than the 20th Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Holders may not exercise this right if such Holder participates in the distribution without conversion.
     (c) If the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, then the holders shall have the right to convert Notes at any time beginning fifteen calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date that is fifteen calendar days after the date that is the effective date of such transaction;
provided
 
such transaction does not otherwise constitute a Designated Event to which the provisions of Section 13.01(d) shall apply. The Company will notify holders of Notes at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Day prior to such 15th day.
     (d) If the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes a Designated Event, a holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the 30th scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Repurchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in Section 13.01(e). The Company shall give notice in writing to all record Noteholders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than 30 scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event.
     (e) (i) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change that occurs prior to August 15, 2017, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below; , , that no increase will be made in the case of Fundamental Change if at least 90% of the consideration paid for the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of shares of capital stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Global Market or another U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on an established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or that will be so traded or quoted immediately following the transaction) and, as a result of such transaction or transactions. the notes become convertible solely into such common stock. Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to Section 13.02(d) below. For purposes of this Section 13.01(e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection" with a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in Section 13.01(d) (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) or (c) of this Section 13.01 shall apply to such conversion).
Additional Shares

     (ii) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the date on which the Fundamental Change occurs or becomes effective (the ""), and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; , , that if (1) the Stock Price is greater than $____ per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04), no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate, and (2) the Stock Price is less than $____ per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed___ per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04).
          (iii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.04 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).

Conversion Procedure.
     (a) Subject to Section 13.02(b), the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (k) below. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
     (b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.01(e) pursuant to this clause (b).
     (A) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is prior to the third Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.02(b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.01(e)) on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to
 
be paid to holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
     (B) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is on or following the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.01(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 13.01(e) above) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
     (c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i) and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (A) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i), and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 13.02(c).
Notice of Conversion
Conversion Date
     No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be tendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.01 or 14.02, as the case may be, except with respect to any portion of such Note that is not subject to the Designated Event Repurchase Notice.
     If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
     (d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in Section 13.02(a), except to
 
the extent specified in Section 13.02(b). The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Conversion Agent or to the holder of the Note surrendered for conversion, or such holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to the Conversion Agent or to such holder, or such holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
     (e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.
     (f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
     (g) Except as provided in Section 13.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
     (h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
     (i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a record date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any regular record date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a record date and on or prior to the
provided
however
 
corresponding Interest Payment Date; (ii) to the extent of any overdue interest existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note; or (iii) for conversions following the regular record date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Notes.
     (j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; , , that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided
however
     (k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
          Section 13.03.
[Intentionally Omitted].
          Section 13.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
     (a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combination into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
 
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
     (b) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance thereof) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
     (c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 13.04(a)), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (including securities, but excluding dividends and distributions covered by Section 13.04(a), Section 13.04(b) or Section 13.04(d) and distributions described below in this paragraph (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 13.04(c) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 4:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP above.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten Trading Days from, and including, the effective date of such Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to ten days
provided
 
shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of trading days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the conversion date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
     Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 13.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 13.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
     For purposes of this Section 13.04(c), Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 13.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) applies or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) or Section 13.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 13.04(b) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 13.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Record Date" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b)
 
and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to such event" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a).
     (d) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 13.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 13.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     (e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock
 
exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 13.04 the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).

     (g) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 13.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article XIII shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 13.04. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity.
     (i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (j) In any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 13.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 13.04(b), or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 13.04(e) (each an

          (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
          (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
          (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
          (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
     (k) For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (l) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Notes prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
          Section 13.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
Shares to Be Fully Paid
          Section 13.06. .
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a "", then:
Merger Event
)
 
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01(a) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV herein.
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 13.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 13.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed to a right to convert such Note by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Noteholder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Notes into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 13.02(b). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII hereof prior to the effective date.
Reference Property
     (c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at his address appearing on the Note register provided for in this
 
Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
          Section 13.07. .
Certain Covenants
     (a) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
     (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company will, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
     (d) The Company covenants that it will take no corporate action which would result in the Conversion Rate being adjusted pursuant to Section 13.04 during the period beginning on the 25 scheduled Trading Day preceding August 15, 2017 until August 15, 2017, other than any such corporate action that may cause the Conversion Rate to adjust as a result of the payment of regular recurring cash dividends; that such dividends are not established or increased during the period beginning on the 25th scheduled Trading Day preceding August 15, 2017 until August 15, 2017.

The Trustee and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and the
Responsibility of Trustee

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 13.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.
          Section 13.09. .

     (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;

Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such
 
dividend, distribution, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.

Upon conversion of the Notes, the holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the associated rights issued under the Rights Plan or under any future shareholder rights plan the Company adopts unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the Rights Plan. If, and only if, the holders receive rights under such shareholder rights plans as described in the preceding sentence upon conversion of their Notes, then no other adjustment pursuant to this Article XIII shall be made in connection with such shareholder rights plans.

Underwriting Agreement
     On August 19, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the "") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "") with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (collectively the "") with respect to the offer and sale of up to $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of the Registrant's 1.5% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 (the ""). The Underwriting Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registrant has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933.

Underwriters
Notes
     The preceding description of the Underwriting Agreement is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Underwriting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Indenture
     As of August 25, 2010, in connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Registrant entered into an Indenture (the "") with respect to the Notes with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "").
Indenture
Trustee
     Under the Indenture, the Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Registrant and will pay interest semiannually at a rate of 1.5% per annum. The Notes will be convertible into shares of the Registrant's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 19.0931 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.37 per share). The initial conversion price represents a premium of 25% to the $41.90 per share closing price of the Registrant's common stock on August 19, 2010. The Notes will be convertible beginning on May 15, 2017, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events. Upon conversion of the Notes, holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each Note, and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of the Registrant's common stock.
     If the Registrant undergoes a "fundamental change," as defined in the Indenture, prior to the maturity of the Notes, the Registrant will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a fundamental change upon conversion, under certain circumstances.
     If the Registrant undergoes a "designated event," as defined in the Indenture, including a "fundamental change," holders will have the option to require the Registrant to purchase all or any portion of their Notes. The designated event purchase price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the designated event purchase date. The Registrant will pay cash for all Notes so purchased.
     The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable.
     The above description of the Indenture and the Notes is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture (and the Form of Notes included therein), which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
     In connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Registrant has entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the "") with the Underwriters (the "") or their respective affiliates. The Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 19,093,100 shares of the Registrant's common stock, which is equal to the number of shares of the Registrant's common stock that will initially underlie the Notes. These transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to the Registrant's common stock upon conversion of the Notes. Separately, the Registrant also has entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Dealers or their respective affiliates to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 19,093,100 shares of the Registrant's common stock, with a strike price of $73.33 (the ""). The Warrant Transactions will have a dilutive effect with respect to the Registrant's common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants.
Hedge Transactions
Dealers
Warrant Transactions
     The cost to the Registrant of the Hedge Transactions, after taking into account the proceeds to the Registrant from the Warrant Transactions, is approximately $104.8 million, assuming the Underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional notes.
     In connection with these hedging transactions, the Dealers or their respective affiliates have entered into various over-the-counter cash-settled derivative transactions with respect to the Registrant's common stock concurrently with the pricing of the Notes, and may unwind these derivatives and/or purchase the Registrant's common stock in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions shortly following pricing of the Notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of the Registrant's common stock concurrently with or shortly following the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Dealers or their respective affiliates may enter into or unwind various over-the-counter derivatives and/or purchase or sell the Registrant's common stock in open market and/or privately negotiated transactions prior to maturity of the Notes, including during any observation period, for the settlement of conversions of Notes, which could adversely impact the price of the Registrant's common stock and of the Notes.
     The following documents are filed in connection with the Registrant's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-157078) filed with the Commission on February 2, 2009.

     (g) To endeavor to qualify the Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you shall reasonably request, provided that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.

Covenants of the Underwriters
     8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any electronic roadshow or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly
Indemnity and Contribution
 
for use therein. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to any issuer free writing prospectus used by the Underwriters in violation of Section 7 hereof.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
     (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Underwriters authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule III hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
     (d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein (other than with respect to Section 8(a) in cases in which Section 8(b) is applicable), then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were
 
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
     (f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
     9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over the counter market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
Termination
 
     10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
     If, on the Closing Date or an Option Closing Date, as the case may be, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Firm Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; provided that in no event shall the principal amount of Firm Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one ninth of such principal amount of Firm Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Firm Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Firm Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Firm Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. If, on an Option Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Securities and the aggregate number of Additional Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional Securities to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall have the option to (i) terminate their obligation hereunder to purchase the Additional Securities to be sold on such Option Closing Date or (ii) purchase not less than the number of Additional Securities that such non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
     If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so
 
terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out of pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
     11. . (a) This Agreement, together with any contemporaneous written agreements and any prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement) that relate to the offering of the Securities, represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
     (b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
     12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts

     If at any time the Depositary for a Global Note (i) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Note or (ii) ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act, the Company may appoint a successor Depositary with respect to such Note. If (1) a successor Depositary for such Global Note is not appointed by the Company within ninety (90) days after the Company receives such notice or the Depositary ceasing to be a registered clearing agency, (2) the Company, at its option, notifies the Trustee that it elects to cause the issuance of Notes in definitive form in exchange for all or any part of the Notes represented by a Global Note, subject to the procedures of the Depositary, or (3) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Note Registrar has received a request from the Depositary for the issuance of Notes in definitive form in exchange for a Global Note, the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officers' Certificate for the authentication and delivery of Notes, will authenticate and deliver Notes in definitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such Global Note, in exchange for such Global Note, and upon delivery of the Global Note to the Trustee such Global Note shall be canceled.
     Definitive Notes issued in exchange for all or a part of the Global Note pursuant to this Section 2.06(d) shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. Upon execution and authentication, the Trustee shall deliver such definitive Notes to the persons in whose names such definitive Notes are so registered.
     At such time as all interests in a Global Note have been converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred, such Global Note shall be, upon receipt thereof, canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Note is exchanged for definitive Notes, converted, canceled, repurchased or transferred to a transferee who receives definitive Notes therefor or any definitive Note is exchanged or transferred for part of such Global Note, the principal amount of such Global Note shall, in accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian, be appropriately reduced or increased, as the case may be, and an endorsement shall be made on such Global Note, by the Trustee or the Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction or increase.
 
          Section 2.07. . In case any Note shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon its written request the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Note, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless from any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes
     The Trustee or such authenticating agent may authenticate any such substituted Note and deliver the same upon the receipt of such security or indemnity as the Trustee, the Company and, if applicable, such authenticating agent may require. Upon the issuance of any substituted Note, the Company or the Trustee may require the payment by the holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith. In case any Note which has matured or is about to mature or has been tendered for repurchase upon a Designated Event or is about to be converted into Common Stock shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, in its sole discretion, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent or Conversion Agent evidence of their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 by virtue of the fact that any Note is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued hereunder. To the extent permitted by law, all Notes shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
          Section 2.08. . Pending the preparation of Notes in certificated form, the Company may execute and the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall, upon written request of the Company, authenticate and deliver temporary Notes (printed or lithographed). Temporary Notes shall be issuable in any authorized denomination, and
Temporary Notes
 
substantially in the form of the Notes in certificated form but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Notes, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated by the Trustee or such authenticating agent upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the same effect, as the Notes in certificated form. Without unreasonable delay the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee or such authenticating agent Notes in certificated form (other than in the case of Notes in global form) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes (other than any Global Note) may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 3.02 and the Trustee or such authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes in certificated form. Such exchange shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as Notes in certificated form authenticated and delivered hereunder.
          Section 2.09. . All Notes surrendered for the purpose of payment, repurchase, conversion, exchange or registration of transfer, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any Paying Agent or any Note Registrar or any Conversion Agent, be surrendered to the Trustee and promptly canceled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly canceled by it, and no Notes shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of canceled Notes in accordance with its customary procedures and, after such destruction, shall deliver a certificate confirming such disposal to the Company, at the Company's written request. If the Company shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not operate as satisfaction of the Indebtedness represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Cancellation of Notes Paid, Etc
          Section 2.10. . The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in Company Notices as a convenience to holders of the Notes; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Notes or Company Notice and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.

The Company may, from time to time, without prior notice to or the consent of the Noteholders and notwithstanding Section 2.01, reopen the Notes and issue additional Notes hereunder with the same terms and with the same CUSIP number as the Notes initially issued hereunder in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, which will form the same series with the Notes initially issued hereunder so long as such additional Notes are fungible with the Notes initially issued hereunder for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company may also from time to time repurchase the Notes in tender offers, open market purchases or negotiated transactions without prior notice to Noteholders.
Additional Notes, Repurchases

     (f) failure by the Company for 60 days to comply with any of its other agreements (other than a covenant or warranty or default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section specifically provided for) contained in the Notes or the Indenture after written notice of such default from the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding has been received by the Company;
     (g) default by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company in the payment of the principal or interest on any mortgage, agreement or other instrument under which there may be outstanding, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any debt for money borrowed in excess of $75 million in the aggregate of the Company and/or any such Subsidiary, whether such debt now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default results in such debt becoming or being declared due and payable, and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled within 30 days after written notice of such acceleration has been received by the Company or such Subsidiary;
     (h) the Company shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; or
 
     (i) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to the Company or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days.
     In case one or more Events of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body), then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(h) or Section 5.01(i) with respect to the Company), unless the principal of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding determined in accordance with Section 7.04, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Noteholders), may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Notes to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

The Company shall notify the Responsible Officer of the Trustee in writing, promptly upon becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default by delivering to the Trustee a statement specifying such Event of Default and any action the Company has taken, is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.
 
     In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the Noteholders, and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

amount due it for reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements, including agents and counsel fees, and including any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.06 hereof, incurred by it up to the date of such distribution.

     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Noteholder or the rights of any Noteholder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Noteholder in any such proceeding.
     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes.
     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party), the Trustee shall be held to represent all the holders of the Notes, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of the Notes parties to any such proceedings.
          Section 5.03. . Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V with respect to the Notes shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon presentation of the several Notes, and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if fully paid:

Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
     (b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
     (i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 6.08 within a reasonable time after written request therefor by the Company or by any Noteholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least six (6) months, or

Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.
     (c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, as determined in accordance with Section 7.04, may at any time remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee which shall be deemed appointed as successor trustee unless within ten (10) days after notice to the Company of such nomination the Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so removed or any Noteholder, upon the terms and conditions and otherwise as in Section 6.10(a) provided, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.
     (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as provided in Section 6.11.

Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.06, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon request of any such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and powers. Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property and funds held or collected by such trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for the benefit of holders of particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.06.
Acceptance by Successor Trustee
 
     No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 6.08 and be eligible under the provisions of Section 6.09.
     Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in this Section 6.11, each of the Company and the successor trustee, at the written direction and at the expense of the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed notice of the succession of such trustee hereunder to the Noteholders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Note register.

          (i) The Notes shall be convertible prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately prior to May 15, 2017, during the five Business Day period immediately after any five consecutive Trading Day period (the "") in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each day of such Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on such date and the Conversion Rate on such date, all as determined by the Bid Solicitation Agent. The Bid Solicitation Agent shall have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes unless requested by the Company to do so in writing. The Company shall have no obligation to make such a determination unless a Noteholder of at least $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price of the Notes would be less than 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price at such time, at which time the Company shall instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent to determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per Note is greater than or equal to 98% of the product of (a) the then-applicable Conversion Rate of the Notes and (b) the Last Reported Sale Price on such date.

     (b) In the event that the Company elects to:
     (i) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock rights entitling them to purchase, for a period expiring within 60 days after the record date for such distribution, Common Stock at a price less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution; or
     (ii) distribute to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, assets or debt securities of the Company or rights to purchase the Company's securities, which distribution has a per share value (as determined by the Board of Directors) exceeding 10% of the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the day immediately preceding the date of declaration of such distribution,
then, in either case, holders may surrender the Notes for conversion at any time on and after the date that the Company provides notice to holders referred to in the next sentence until the earlier of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution or the date the Company announces that such distribution will not take place. The Company shall notify holders of any distribution referred to in either clause (i) or clause (ii) above and of the resulting conversion right no later than the 20th Business Day prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. Holders may not exercise this right if such Holder participates in the distribution without conversion.
     (c) If the Company consolidates with or merges with or into another Person or is a party to a binding share exchange or conveys, transfers, sells, leases or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities and/or other property, then the holders shall have the right to convert Notes at any time beginning fifteen calendar days prior to the date announced by the Company as the anticipated effective date of the transaction and until and including the date that is fifteen calendar days after the date that is the effective date of such transaction;

such transaction does not otherwise constitute a Designated Event to which the provisions of Section 13.01(d) shall apply. The Company will notify holders of Notes at least 20 calendar days prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction. The Board of Directors shall determine the anticipated effective date of the transaction, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be publicly announced by the Company and posted on its web site not later than two Business Day prior to such 15th day.
     (d) If the Company is a party to any transaction or event that constitutes a Designated Event, a holder may surrender Notes for conversion at any time from and after the 30th scheduled Trading Day prior to the anticipated effective date of such transaction or event until the related Designated Event Repurchase Date and, upon such surrender, if such Designated Event also constitutes a Fundamental Change, the holder shall be entitled to the increase in the Conversion Rate, if any, specified in Section 13.01(e). The Company shall give notice in writing to all record Noteholders and the Trustee of the Designated Event no later than 30 scheduled Trading Days prior to the anticipated effective date of the Designated Event.
     (e) (i) If a Noteholder elects to convert Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change that occurs prior to August 15, 2017, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below; , , that no increase will be made in the case of Fundamental Change if at least 90% of the consideration paid for the Company's Common Stock (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in such Fundamental Change transaction consists of shares of capital stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Global Market or another U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on an established automated over-the-counter trading market in the United States (or that will be so traded or quoted immediately following the transaction) and, as a result of such transaction or transactions. the notes become convertible solely into such common stock. Settlement of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as provided in this subsection shall be settled pursuant to Section 13.02(d) below. For purposes of this Section 13.01(e), a conversion shall be deemed to be "in connection" with a Fundamental Change to the extent that such conversion is effected during the time period specified in Section 13.01(d) (regardless of whether the provisions of clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (b) or (c) of this Section 13.01 shall apply to such conversion).
Additional Shares

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 23.8663 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 13.04).
          (iii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule A hereto shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Notes is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.04 (other than by operation of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate by adding Additional Shares).

Conversion Procedure.
     (a) Subject to Section 13.02(b), the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion in cash and shares of fully paid Common Stock, if applicable, by delivering, on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the related Observation Period, cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, equal to the sum of the Daily Settlement Amounts for each of the 20 Trading Days during the related Observation Period; that the Company will deliver cash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock as set forth pursuant to clause (k) below. The Daily Settlement Amounts shall be determined by the Company promptly following the last day of the Observation Period.
provided
     (b) Notwithstanding Section 13.02(a), the Company shall satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion to which Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 13.01(e) pursuant to this clause (b).
     (A) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is prior to the third Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the related Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.02(b) by delivering the cash and shares of Common Stock (based on the Conversion Rate, but without regard to the number of Additional Shares to be added to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 13.01(e)) on the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period. As soon as practicable following the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change, the Company will deliver the increase in such amount of cash and Reference Property in lieu of shares of Common Stock, if any, as if the Conversion Rate had been increased by such number of Additional Shares during the related Observation Period (and based upon the related Daily VWAP prices during such Observation Period). If such increased amount of cash and shares, if any, results in an increase to the amount of cash to
 
be paid to holders, the Company will pay such increase in cash, and if such increased amount results in an increase to the number of shares of Common Stock, the Company will deliver such increase by delivering Reference Property based on such increased number of shares.
     (B) If the last day of the applicable Observation Period related to Notes surrendered for conversion is on or following the third scheduled Trading Day preceding the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change, the Company will satisfy the Conversion Obligation with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered for conversion as described in Section 13.01(b) (based on the Conversion Rate as increased by the Additional Shares pursuant to Section 13.01(e) above) on the later to occur of (1) the Effective Date of the Fundamental Change and (2) the third Trading Day immediately following the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
     (c) Before any holder of a Note shall be entitled to convert the same as set forth above, such holder shall (1) in the case of a Global Note, comply with the procedures of the Depositary in effect at that time and, if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i) and, if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any, and (2) in the case of a Note issued in certificated form, (A) complete and manually sign and deliver an irrevocable written notice to the Conversion Agent in the form on the reverse of such certificated Note (or a facsimile thereof) (a "") at the office of the Conversion Agent and shall state in writing therein the principal amount of Notes to be converted and the name or names (with addresses) in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for any shares of Common Stock, if any, to be delivered upon settlement of the Conversion Obligation to be registered, (B) surrender such Notes, duly endorsed to the Company or in blank (and accompanied by appropriate endorsement and transfer documents), at the office of the Conversion Agent, (C) if required, pay funds equal to interest payable on the next Interest Payment Date to which such holder is not entitled as set forth in Section 13.02(i), and (D) if required, pay all taxes or duties, if any. A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the holder has complied with the requirements set forth in this Section 13.02(c).
Notice of Conversion
Conversion Date
     No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be tendered by a holder thereof if such holder has also tendered a Designated Event Repurchase Notice and not validly withdrawn such Designated Event Repurchase Notice in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 14.01 or 14.02, as the case may be, except with respect to any portion of such Note that is not subject to the Designated Event Repurchase Notice.
     If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes, if any, that shall be payable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
     (d) Delivery of the amounts owing in satisfaction of the Conversion Obligation shall be made by the Company in no event later than the date specified in Section 13.02(a), except to
 
the extent specified in Section 13.02(b). The Company shall make such delivery by paying the cash amount owed to the Conversion Agent or to the holder of the Note surrendered for conversion, or such holder's nominee or nominees, and by issuing, or causing to be issued, and delivering to the Conversion Agent or to such holder, or such holder's nominee or nominees, certificates or a book-entry transfer through the Depositary for the number of full shares of Common Stock, if any, to which such holder shall be entitled as part of such Conversion Obligation (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares).
     (e) In case any Note shall be surrendered for partial conversion, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the Note so surrendered, without charge to such holder, a new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Notes.
     (f) If a holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay all stamp and other duties, if any, which may be imposed by the United States or any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock, if any, upon the conversion. However, the holder shall pay any such tax which is due because the holder requests any shares of Common Stock to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax which will be due because the shares are to be issued in a name other than the holder's name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax withholding required by law or regulations.
     (g) Except as provided in Section 13.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article.
     (h) Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Note, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee, shall make a notation on such Global Note as to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby. The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversion of Notes effected through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.
     (i) Upon conversion, a Noteholder will not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligations as described above shall be deemed to satisfy its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a record date, holders of such Notes as of the close of business on the record date will receive the interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any regular record date to the opening of business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on the Notes so converted; , , that no such payment need be made (i) if the Company has specified a Designated Event Purchase Date that is after a record date and on or prior to the

corresponding Interest Payment Date; (ii) to the extent of any overdue interest existing at the time of conversion with respect to such Note; or (iii) for conversions following the regular record date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Except as described above, no payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on converted Notes.
     (j) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record on and after the Conversion Date; , , that no surrender of Notes on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date that such Notes shall have been surrendered for conversion, as if the stock transfer books of the Company had not been closed. Upon conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Noteholder.
provided
however
     (k) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes. If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Note or Notes (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last day of the applicable Observation Period.
          Section 13.03.
[Intentionally Omitted].
          Section 13.04. . The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:
Adjustment of Conversion Rate
     (a) In case the Company shall issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution to holders of all or substantially all of the outstanding Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or combination into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
CR = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
 
CR' = the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
OS = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Ex-Dividend Date for such event;
0
OS' = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Ex-Dividend Date for such event.
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the Record Date fixed for such determination. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 13.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination had not been declared.
     (b) In case the Company shall issue to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock rights or warrants entitling them (for a period expiring within sixty (60) calendar days after the issuance thereof) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
 
Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights, warrants or convertible securities are issued and shall become effective immediately after 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for such determination. If such rights, warrants or convertible securities are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Record Date for such distribution had not been fixed. To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, warrants or convertible securities, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.
In determining whether any rights, warrants or convertible securities entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
     (c) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 13.04(a)), evidences of its Indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company (including securities, but excluding dividends and distributions covered by Section 13.04(a), Section 13.04(b) or Section 13.04(d) and distributions described below in this paragraph (c) with respect to Spin-Offs) (any of such shares of Capital Stock, Indebtedness, or other asset or property hereinafter in this Section 13.04(c) called the ""), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
where
 
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to 4:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day following the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution; that if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes upon conversion, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 13.04(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in determining SP above.

With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 13.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock or shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit (a ""), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
where
Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; that in respect of any conversion within the ten Trading Days from, and including, the effective date of such Spin-Off, references within this paragraph (c) to ten days
provided
 
shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of trading days as have elapsed between such Spin-Off and the conversion date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate.
     Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common Stock, entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 13.04 (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 13.04(c). If any such right or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of Indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 13.04 was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights and warrants had not been issued.
Trigger Event
     For purposes of this Section 13.04(c), Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 13.04(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) applies or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 13.04(a) or Section 13.04(b) applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of Indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 13.04(b) applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 13.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the record date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted as "the Record Date" and "the date fixed for such determination" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a) and Section 13.04(b)
 
and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to such event" within the meaning of Section 13.04(a).
     (d) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution consisting exclusively of cash to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
where
Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; that if the portion of the cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP as above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion of a Note (or any portion thereof) the amount of cash such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

     For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 13.04(d), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Notes become convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 13.04(d), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Last Reported Sale Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Notes are then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisions of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications.
     (e) In case the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock
 
exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where
such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting all or any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. No adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made if the application of the foregoing formula would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate.
     (f) For purposes of this Section 13.04 the term "" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise).
Record Date
 
     (g) In addition to those required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 13.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06 a notice of the increase at least fifteen days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
     (h) All calculations and other determinations under this Article XIII shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. No adjustment shall be made for the Company's issuance of Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities or rights to purchase Common Stock or convertible or exchangeable securities, other than as provided in this Section 13.04. No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate unless such adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate then in effect at such time. The Company shall carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1% within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward, upon a Fundamental Change, or upon maturity.
     (i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. The Trustee and Conversion Agent may conclusively rely on the accuracy of the Conversion Rate adjustment provided by the Company. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register provided for in Section 2.06, within twenty (20) days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.
     (j) In any case in which this Section 13.04 provides that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date or Record Date for an event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 13.04(a), (3) a date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or warrants pursuant to Section 13.04(b), or (4) the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to any tender or exchange offer pursuant to Section 13.04(e) (each an
 
""), the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment Event (as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Note converted after such Adjustment Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment Event, the additional cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event over and above the amounts deliverable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 13.04. For purposes of this Section 13.04(j), the term "" shall mean:
Adjustment Determination Date
Adjustment Event
          (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of such event,
          (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such dividend or distribution is paid or made,
          (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of expiration of such rights or warrants, and
          (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is consummated and becomes irrevocable.
     (k) For purposes of this Section 13.04, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.
     (l) For the avoidance of doubt, if a holder converts Notes prior to the effective date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the holder will not be entitled to an increased Conversion Rate in connection with such conversion.
          Section 13.05. . The Company shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are presented for conversion.
Shares to Be Fully Paid
          Section 13.06. .
Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale
     If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation, merger or combination of the Company with another Person, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event a "", then:
Merger Event
)
 
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 9.01(a) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Notes as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the holders of the Notes as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the extent required by the Board of Directors and practicable the provisions providing for the repurchase rights set forth in Article XIV herein.
     In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 13.06, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or asset that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Noteholders.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.02(a) and Section 13.02(b), and subject to the provisions of Section 13.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Notes will be changed to a right to convert such Note by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the "") such that from and after the effective time of such transaction, a Noteholder will be entitled thereafter to convert its Notes into cash (up to the aggregate principal amount thereof) and the same type (and in the same proportion) of Reference Property, based on the Daily Settlement Amounts of Reference Property in an amount equal to the applicable Conversion Rate, as described under Section 13.02(b). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyance of assets or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election) will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election. The Company shall not become a party to any such transaction unless its terms are consistent with the preceding. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect the right of a holder of Notes to convert its Notes in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII hereof prior to the effective date.
Reference Property
     (c) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental indenture to be mailed to each Noteholder, at his address appearing on the Note register provided for in this
 
Indenture, within twenty (20) days after execution thereof Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (d) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
          Section 13.07. .
Certain Covenants
     (a) Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Notes will be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and changes with respect to the issue thereof.
     (b) The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the case may be.
     (c) The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system the Company will, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes.
     (d) The Company covenants that it will take no corporate action which would result in the Conversion Rate being adjusted pursuant to Section 13.04 during the period beginning on the 25 scheduled Trading Day preceding August 15, 2017 until August 15, 2017, other than any such corporate action that may cause the Conversion Rate to adjust as a result of the payment of regular recurring cash dividends; that such dividends are not established or increased during the period beginning on the 25th scheduled Trading Day preceding August 15, 2017 until August 15, 2017.

Responsibility of Trustee

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 13.06 relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such Section 13.06 or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.

Such authenticating agent shall at all times be a person eligible to serve as trustee hereunder pursuant to Section 6.09.
Authenticating Agent
     Any corporation into which any authenticating agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, consolidation or
 
conversion to which any authenticating agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate trust business of any authenticating agent, shall be the successor of the authenticating agent hereunder, if such successor corporation is otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the parties hereto or the authenticating agent or such successor corporation.
     Any authenticating agent may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of any authenticating agent by giving written notice of termination to such authenticating agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any authenticating agent shall cease to be eligible under this Section, the Trustee shall promptly appoint a successor authenticating agent (which may be the Trustee), shall give written notice of such appointment to the Company and shall mail notice of such appointment to all Noteholders as the names and addresses of such holders appear on the Note register.
     The Company agrees to pay to the authenticating agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services although the Company may terminate the authenticating agent, if it determines such agent's fees to be unreasonable.
     The provisions of Section 6.02, Section 6.03, Section 6.04, Section 7.03 and this Section 15.11 shall be applicable to any authenticating agent.
          Section 15.11. . This Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note or such other Notes.

     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount will be issued to the
 
transferee in exchange thereof, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax, assessments or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.

All payments made to or upon the order of such registered holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, satisfy and discharge liability for monies payable on this Note.

Unless the Executive elects otherwise, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments by first reducing or eliminating any cash severance benefits, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of stock options, then by reducing or eliminating any accelerated vesting of other equity-based awards, then by reducing or eliminating any other rema ining Total Payments.

Any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive upon or in the six (6) mon th period following the Executives Separation from Service that are not so paid by reason of this Section 5.01(f) shall be paid (without interest) on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months after the Executives Separation from Service (or, if earlier, as soon as  practicable, and in all events within ten (10) business days, after the date of the Executives death).  The payment timing provisions of this Section 5.01(f) shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

In order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent that any payment or reimbursement of expenses made to the Executive pursuant to Section 5.01(c) or Section 5.01(d) is taxable to the Executive, any such payment or reimbursement shall be made to the Executive no later than the earlier of (i) the deadline set forth in the preceding sentence, or (ii) the last day of the Executives taxable year following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred.  The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to require or permit a delay in any such payment or reimbursement.  The Executives right to any such payment or reimbursement or any benefit pursuant to Section 5.01(c) or Section 5.01(d) is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit and the amount of such benefits that the Executive receives in one taxable year shall not affect the amount of such benefits that the Executive receives in any other taxable year.
 
(h)
 
Immediately prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Company shall fund, to the extent it has not done so, a sum equal to the present value on the date of the Change of Control of (i) any amounts that are or could reasonably be expected to become payable to the Executive under the provisions of Section 5.01(a) in the event of a Change of Control Termination of the Executive, (ii) an amount representing restricted stock units that could become vested under the provisions of Section 5.01(b) in the event of a Change of Control Termination of the Executive, and (iii) an amount representing a good faith estimate of expenses of the trust in the event that the Company does not timely pay such expenses. Such funding shall be made by establishing and irrevocably funding a trust for the benefit of the Executive.  The funding representing restricted stock units referred to in clause (ii) above shall (x) be in an amount equal to the consideration paid in the Change of Control for each share of the Companys common stock times the number of shares represented by the Executives unvested restricted stock units, and (y) in the Companys discretion, be deposited in the form of cash or the in-kind consideration paid in the Change of Control, or a combination thereof.  The trustee of such trust shall be instructed to pay out any such amounts as and to the extent such amounts become payable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Payments by the trust to the Executive shall, to the extent thereof, discharge the Companys obligation to pay benefits under Sections 5.01(a) and 5.01(b).  The Company shall remain obligated to pay the Executive any benefits under this Agreement that are not paid to the Executive from the trust.  The trust shall be a grantor trust described in Section 671 of the Code. Assets of the trust shall be used only to provide the benefits under Sections 5.01(a) and 5.01(b), except that the assets of the trust shall be available to the Companys creditors in the event of the Companys insolvency.  The trust shall not terminate until the date on which all payments and benefits to be funded out of the trust have been satisfied and discharged in full.  Upon termination of the trust any assets remaining in the trust shall be returned to the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not fund the trust if, at the time such funding would otherwise have been required under this Section 5.01(h), regulations, rulings or other official guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service provide that such funding would reasonably be expected to result in a transfer of property under Code Section 409A(b)(2) (r elating to restrictions on assets in connection with a change in an employers financial health).

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 21, 2010, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended October 3, 2010.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to b oth management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants cash-settled convertible notes, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management us es non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, and non-cash economic interest expense associated with cash-settled convertible notes, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.  The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business prospects and outlook in fiscal 2011, and our expectations regarding our business, including expected growth in flash memory demand for embedded and other flash memory products for use in mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, that are based on our current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking stateme nts to be inaccurate and may significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others:
competitive pricing pressures, resulting in lower average selling prices and lower or negative product gross margins;
unpredictable or changing demand for our products, particularly for certain form factors, such as embedded flash memory, or capacities, or the mix of X2 and X3;
expansion of industry supply, including low grade supply useable in limited markets, creating excess market supply, causing our average selling prices to decline faster than our costs;
excess captive memory output or capacity which could result in write-downs for excess inventory, lower of cost or market charges, fixed costs associated with under-utilized capacity, or other consequences;
increased memory component and other costs as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Japanese yen;
lower than anticipated demand, including due to general economic weakness in our markets;
insufficient supply from captive flash memory sources, inability to obtain non-captive flash memory supply of the right product mix with adequate margins and quality in the time frame necessary to meet demand, or inability to realize a positive margin on non-captive purchases; and
other risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2010.

On April 21, 2011, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its first quarter ended April 3, 2011.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.  In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses.  These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future.  Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant.  For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006 and MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants convertible , GAAP results.  These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
debt the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting.  These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods.  Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with convertible debt , as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results.  These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to
and tax valuation allowances,

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This news release contains certain forward-looking statements, including statements about our business prospects and outlook in fiscal 2011, our actions to mitigate the impact of the recent earthquake and related nuclear accident in Japan, the expected benefits of our next-generation iNAND Ultra and HQME products, and our expectations regarding our business, that are based on our current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate and may significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks that may cause these forward-looking statements to be inaccurate include among others:
negative effects of the Japan earthquake and related nuclear accident on us, our suppliers, our OEM and retail customers, and suppliers of other components to our OEM customers;
competitive pricing pressures, resulting in lower average selling prices and lower or negative product gross margins;
unpredictable or changing demand for our products, particularly for certain form factors, such as embedded flash memory, or capacities, or the mix of X2 and X3;
insufficient supply from captive flash memory sources, inability to obtain non-captive flash memory supply of the right product mix with adequate margins and quality in the time frame necessary to meet demand, or inability to realize a positive margin on non-captive purchases;
expansion of industry supply, including low grade supply useable in limited markets, creating excess market supply, causing our average selling prices to decline faster than our costs;
excess captive memory output or capacity which could result in write-downs for excess inventory, lower of cost or market charges, fixed costs associated with under-utilized capacity, or other consequences;
increased memory component and other costs as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations to the U.S. dollar, particularly with respect to the Japanese yen;
lower than anticipated demand, including due to general economic weakness in our markets; and
the other risks detailed from time-to-time under the caption Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On October 20, 2011, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its third quarter ended October 2, 2011.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Registrant's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008 and Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrant's convertible debt and tax valuation allowances, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with convertible debt and tax valuation allowances, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 25, 2012, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 1, 2012.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, MusicGremlin, Inc. in June 2008 and Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants convertible debt, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the repurchased portion of the convertible debt, and tax valuation allowances, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provide consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with convertible debt, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the repurchased portion of the convertible debt, and tax valuation allowances, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
  
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

SANDISK ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
Milpitas, CA, April 19, 2012 - SanDisk
Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), a global leader in flash memory storage solutions, announced today results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2012. Total first quarter revenue of $1.21 billion declined 7% on a year-over-year basis and declined 24% on a sequential basis.
On a GAAP
(1)
basis, first quarter net income was $114 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to net income of $224 million, or $0.92, per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and $281 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.
On a non-GAAP
(2)
basis, first quarter net income was $156 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to net income of $251 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and net income of $317 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
Our first quarter results were adversely impacted by lower-than-expected pricing and demand weakness in certain segments and we expect similar trends in the second quarter as well, said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive officer. We believe a seasonally stronger demand environment in the second half of the year, combined with our diversifying portfolio of mobile and SSD solutions, will allow us to deliver strong sequential revenue growth in the third and fourth quarters.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July 19, 2012, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its second quarter ended July 1, 2012.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012 and Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants convertible debt and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with convertible debt and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
  
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing.

SANDISK ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
Milpitas, CA, July 19, 2012 - SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), a global leader in flash memory storage solutions, announced today results for the second quarter ended July 1, 2012. Total second quarter revenue of $1.03 billion declined 25% on a year-over-year basis and declined 14% on a sequential basis.
On a GAAP
(1)
basis, second quarter net income was $13 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $248 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and $114 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.
On a non-GAAP
(2)
basis, second quarter net income was $51 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $278 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and net income of $156 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. For reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables and footnotes.
We delivered second quarter results in line with our forecast, reflecting short-term weakness in our mobile OEM sales, strength in retail, especially in international markets, and growth in our enterprise and client SSD products, said Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive officer of SanDisk. I am pleased to report that our SSD revenues achieved 10% of second quarter sales with growing adoption of our solutions by major OEMs. We also made good progress on our embedded product roadmap for mobile customers. We believe that strengthening industry fundamentals and our expanding portfolio of solutions will contribute to improving financial results in the second half of 2012.

If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented.

The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to business other than nominations if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholders proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.
                             (A)(4) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 13 and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 13 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth (10
th
) day following the day on which such public announcement regarding an
4
increase in the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is first made by the corporation.

Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 13 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of such stockholders nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholders representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(vi) of this Section 13), and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 13, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. For purposes of this Section 13, to be considered a qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such writing or a reliable reproduction of the writing at the meeting of stockholders.

Nothing in this Section 13 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporations proxy statement pursuant to applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation.

Section 2.

In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he/she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

When authorizing such issue of a new certificate or certificates of stock or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates, or his or her legal representative, to give the corporation a bond in such sum sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against the corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 5.
    In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action as hereinbefore described, nor, for a consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.

Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days after the earliest dated written consent received, a valid written consent or valid written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed by this Section 5 and applicable law and not revoked. In addition, the corporation shall be entitled to engage independent inspectors of elections to promptly perform a ministerial review of the validity of the written consents. No action by written consent shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review. Nothing contained in this Section 5 shall be construed to imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On
January 23, 2013
, SanDisk Corporation (the Registrant) issued a press release to report its financial results for its
fourth
quarter and fiscal year ended
December 30, 2012
.
The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In addition to the condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the attached press release contains non-GAAP measures of operating results, net income and net income per share, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Registrants current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Registrant believes the non-GAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the Registrant. For example, because the non-GAAP results exclude the expenses the Registrant recorded for share-based compensation, the amortization and write-off of acquisition-related intangible assets related to acquisitions of Matrix Semiconductor, Inc. in January 2006, Pliant Technology, Inc. in May 2011, FlashSoft Corporation in February 2012 and Schooner Information Technology, Inc. in June 2012, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the Registrants convertible debt, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the repurchased portion of the convertible debt and related tax adjustments, the Registrant believes the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency in its financial reporting. These non-GAAP results are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing performance, allocating resources and planning and forecasting future periods. Further, management uses non-GAAP information that excludes certain non-cash charges, such as amortization and write-off of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation, non-cash economic interest expense associated with the convertible debt, non-cash change in fair value of the liability component of the repurchased portion of the convertible debt and related tax adjustments, as these non-GAAP charges do not reflect the cash operating results of the business or the ongoing results. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may be different than the non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The information contained herein and in the accompanying exhibit shall not be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Registrant, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing, unless expressly incorporated by specific reference to this or such filing. The information in this report, including the exhibit hereto, shall be deemed to be furnished and therefore shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section or Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
