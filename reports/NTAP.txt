Index to Exhibits Exhibit Description - ------- ----------- 99.1 Press release of Network Appliance, Inc. issued on November 4, 2003.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Network Appliance Agrees to Acquire Spinnaker Networks; Accelerates NetApp Vision for ''Storage Grid'' Future SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 4, 2003--Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq:NTAP), a leading provider of enterprise storage solutions, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Spinnaker Networks, Inc., a privately held company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for approximately $300 million in an all stock transaction. Spinnaker is a pioneer in scalable system architectures, distributed file systems, next-generation clustering technologies, and virtualization. For Network Appliance, this is primarily a software technology acquisition that reaffirms the NetApp business model and extends NetApp leadership in scalability, simplicity, and total cost of ownership for enterprise storage systems. This acquisition accelerates the delivery of the NetApp(R) "Storage Grid" architecture enabling customers to leverage even more value from their storage and data infrastructures. The combination of Network Appliance and Spinnaker gives Network Appliance a competitive, leadership position in bringing Storage Grid architectures to market more quickly, and draws upon the technology prowess of each company to offer superior storage solutions today. Equally applicable to SAN (storage area network) and NAS (network-attached storage) environments, Storage Grids are the ideal complement to the grid computing paradigm promoted by other technology industry leaders. Storage Grids offer rapid and simple scalability of capacity, performance, availability, quality of service, and/or connection protocols on demand; a unified view and management of all corporate data far surpassing today's limited virtualization approaches; and optimized performance for remote data access in distributed enterprises. The Storage Grid architecture will enable tighter application integration with database and enterprise applications, provide superior data protection, have the ability to more easily manage data resources based on policies, and provide improved data security. The NetApp Storage Grid architecture will offer these benefits leveraging commodity component costs which dramatically lower customers' acquisition, expansion, and management costs. In other words, the NetApp Storage Grid architecture is an ideal platform for next-generation information lifecycle management (ILM). Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance, said, "Today's business demands fast, reliable, secure access to data and robust new approaches for information lifecycle management. The combination of NetApp unified storage and software solutions with advanced distributed systems architectures from Spinnaker further accelerates the shift to networked storage and speeds our ability to deliver powerful new Storage Grids as the foundation for data infrastructures of the future. Data-intensive enterprises benefit from higher performance, more flexibility and scalability, increased infrastructure reliability, and much tighter integration with database and layered applications." Ron Bianchini, president, CEO, and co-founder of Spinnaker, continued, "The combination of Network Appliance and Spinnaker enables us to more quickly deliver what our customers are asking for -- flexible data infrastructure that offers high performance, massive and simple scalability, and tremendous data availability and security. Network Appliance's leadership position in networked storage, history of innovation, global sales and support capabilities, cultural fit with Spinnaker, and financial health are very compelling for us to bring our technologies and products to more customers, helping them maximize their current data infrastructure returns while preparing for an exciting Storage Grid future." Steve Duplessie, principal analyst at Enterprise Storage Group, added, "Spinnaker is a leader in next-generation storage architecture. With this technology, Network Appliance is clearly extending its offerings in high-end storage solutions, and with its ability to unify SAN by adding Fibre Channel and iSCSI, this has the potential to be a great move for NetApp. You just gotta love a market leader that continues to aggressively pursue technology innovations. This will enhance the NetApp competitive position and time to market with the next new advance. I can't find a single thing I don't like about this deal." "Through the first three quarters of this year, Spinnaker has shipped more than 75 SpinServer systems worldwide to a broad range of customers in all of the company's major targeted verticals. New customers include Acxiom, a data management services company; Industrial Light & Magic, a Lucasfilm Ltd. company serving the digital needs of the entertainment industry for visual effects and animation; Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the United States Department of Energy's largest science and energy laboratory; and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies with laboratories focused on the overarching areas of neurosciences, molecular biology, genetics, and plant biology," continued Warmenhoven. "The addition of NetApp to the mix only strengthens the value equation of unified storage plus advanced distributed systems capabilities yielding massive returns in performance, reliability, and scalability." "We recognized the value of Spinnaker's advanced distributed file system architecture when the firm first invested in the company in 2000," said Promod Haque, managing partner at Norwest Venture Partners and lead investor in Spinnaker Networks. "Today the enterprise storage market is highly innovative and competitive, and an important area of IT investment for leading corporations worldwide." Acquisition Terms The closing of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions, including expiration of waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and if applicable, foreign antitrust laws, and is expected to occur by January 2004. Network Appliance is committed to supporting Spinnaker products and services. Upon completion of the acquisition, Network Appliance intends to integrate the SpinServer product line into the Network Appliance(TM) product family and operate Spinnaker as an engineering and development site for NetApp in Pittsburgh, adding to existing NetApp research and development teams in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and California in the United States, and internationally at the company's Bangalore Technology Center in India. Conference Call and Webcast Dan Warmenhoven, CEO; Steve Gomo, CFO; and Dave Hitz, executive vice president of engineering, will host a live Webcast and conference call to discuss the acquisition at 8:30 a.m. EST (5:30 a.m. PST), today.

The shares of Parent Stock issued in connection with the Merger as a result of the conversions provided for in this Section 2.6(b)(i) are sometimes referred to herein as the "Merger Shares." 17
(ii) Sub Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be converted into and thereafter represent one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, so that thereafter Parent will be the sole and exclusive owner of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(iv) Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a Merger Share shall receive from Parent an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share of a Merger Share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by (ii) the Closing Price. The fractional share determination shall be made individually for each Stockholder after giving effect to the delivery of the Indemnity Escrow Shares (as defined below), to the Depositary Agent, and the Retention Escrow Shares (as defined below), to the Retention Escrow Agent, it being recognized that, as provided in Section 2.10, only whole shares may be delivered to the Depositary Agent and Retention Escrow Agent.

If any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange for such shares will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement. 2.7 Surrender of Certificates. (a) Distribution of Transmittal Letter. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) business days after the Effective Time), Parent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder of certificates or certificates evidencing Common Stock or Preferred Stock (the "Certificates") a letter of transmittal in customary form (which 18
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to Parent or its designated representative and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably specify) (the "Transmittal Letter") and instructions for such holder's use in effecting the surrender of the Certificate and the exercise of the rights of such holder to obtain its Merger Shares. (b) Delivery of Certificates. Upon surrender to Parent or its designated representative of any Certificates for cancellation, together with a duly executed and completed Transmittal Letter, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.6, less such holder's pro rata portion of Merger Shares to be deposited with the Depositary Agent or with the Retention Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.10 hereof, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(c). Such certificate representing shares of Parent Stock shall be delivered to the stockholder as promptly as practicable after such surrender, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after such surrender. (c) Cancellation of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Upon surrender of each Certificate and delivery by Parent of the Merger Shares to be delivered in exchange therefor, such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the aggregate number of Merger Shares into which the Common Stock or Preferred Stock represented thereby shall have been converted in accordance with the terms and upon the conditions of this Agreement (including the requirement that a portion of such Merger Shares be deposited with the Depositary Agent or with the Retention Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.10), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.6(c). (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Stock declared or made after the Effective Time and with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, promptly following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time, if any, theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Stock. 2.8 No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. The shares of Parent Stock delivered upon the surrender for exchange of Common Stock or Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Common Stock or Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, the Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article 2. 19
2.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Stock as may be required pursuant to Section 2.6; provided, however, that Parent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an indemnity or bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 2.10 Escrow of Merger Shares. (a) Indemnity Escrow Shares. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article 2, Parent shall deliver to the Depositary Agent that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to (i) the number of Merger Shares multiplied by (ii) 0.10, and rounded to a whole number of shares on a holder-by-holder basis (such shares of Parent Stock delivered to the Depositary Agent, the "Indemnity Escrow Shares"). The portion of the Indemnity Escrow Shares contributed on behalf of each Stockholder shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled under Section 2.6. The Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be withheld from the Parent Stock otherwise deliverable to the Stockholders. The Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be deposited with the Depositary Agent and disbursed in accordance with the Indemnity Escrow Agreement. (b) Retention Escrow Shares.

The portion of the Retention Escrow Shares contributed on behalf of each Core Employee shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock which such Core Employee would otherwise be entitled under Section 2.6. Pursuant to the terms of the Restricted Stock Agreements, the Retention Escrow Shares shall be withheld from the Parent Stock otherwise deliverable to the Core Employees. The Retention Escrow Shares shall be deposited with the Retention Escrow Agent and disbursed in accordance with the Retention Escrow Agreement. 2.11 Dissenting Shares (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock held by a holder who has demanded and perfected dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Stock pursuant to Section 2.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, if any holder of shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock who demands dissenters' rights for such shares 20
under the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) the right to dissenters' rights, then, as of the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent Stock as provided in Section 2.6, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares. (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of its receipt of any written demands for dissenters' rights for any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments relating to the Merger served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters' rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent or as may be required under applicable law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for dissenters' rights for Common Stock or Preferred Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 2.12 Options/Restricted Stock Units.

(ii) The exercise price per share of Parent Stock under the New Option shall be equal to (x) the exercise price per share of the Common Stock under the Company Option, divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded upward to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the exercise price per share be greater than the Closing Price, provided that any reduction in such exercise price as a result of the application of this sentence shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating "Equity Consideration." The adjustment provided herein with respect to any Company Option which is an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be, and is intended to be, effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as provided in this Section 2.12, after the Effective Time, each New Option shall be exercisable upon the same terms and 21
conditions as were applicable to the related Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that with regard to such New Option, any references to the Company shall be deemed, as appropriate, to mean Parent). Parent shall take all action necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time, to authorize and reserve a number of shares of Parent Stock sufficient for issuance upon the exercise of New Options as contemplated by this Section 2.12. (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) and the Parent Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions necessary to provide that effective at the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Stock Unit, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments in this Section 2.12) and each such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be converted automatically into a restricted stock unit (a "New Restricted Stock Unit") for that number of shares of Parent Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock subject (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) to the Company Restricted Stock Unit multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; provided, that the number of shares of Parent Stock resulting therefrom shall be rounded downward to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock. Except as provided in this Section 2.12, after the Effective Time, each New Restricted Stock Unit shall be exercisable upon the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that with regard to such New Restricted Stock Unit, any references to the Company shall be deemed, as appropriate, to mean Parent). Parent shall take all action necessary, on or prior to the Effective Time, to authorize and reserve a number of shares of Parent Stock sufficient for issuance pursuant to the New Restricted Stock Units as contemplated by this Section 2.12. (c) Parent shall file promptly (but in no event later than ten (10) business days) after the Effective Time, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Stock to be issued in connection with the exercise of the New Options and under the New Restricted Stock Units as determined in this Section 2.12 and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. (d) As soon as practicable (but in no event later than ten (10) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of New Options and New Restricted Stock Units appropriate notices setting forth (i) such holders' rights pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plan and (ii) that the agreements evidencing such options shall continue on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.12 after giving effect to the Merger). 2.13 Warrants. At the Effective Time, all rights with respect to Preferred Stock under Company Warrants that are then outstanding shall be converted into and become rights with respect to Parent Stock, and Parent shall assume each Company Warrant in accordance with the terms (as in effect on the date hereof) of such Company Warrants. From and after the Effective Time, (a) each Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (b), the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to each Company Warrant shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Preferred 22
Stock subject to each Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time would have been converted, had such Preferred Stock been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounding down to the nearest whole share of Parent Stock, (c) the per share exercise price under each such Company Warrant shall be adjusted by dividing (i) the per share exercise price under each such Company Warrant, assuming the Preferred Stock subject to each Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time had been converted to Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding up to the nearest cent, and (d) any restriction on exercise of any Company Warrant shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, schedule and other provisions of such Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that such Company Warrant shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction subsequent to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary (under the Company Warrants or otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.13 and to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Warrants have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically provided herein. 2.14 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Parent, Sub, and the Company will take all such reasonable lawful action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effect the Merger in accordance with this Agreement as promptly as practicable. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest Parent with full right, title and possession to all the property, rights, privileges, power and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors of Sub, Parent and the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action. 2.15 Withholding. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Stockholder such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholders in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

The Company shall promptly notify Parent if the Company becomes aware that one of its stockholders intends to dissent or object to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby at such hearing. If for any reason whatsoever the Commissioner does not render a Fairness Approval of the terms and conditions of the Merger and the issuance of the Parent Stock as contemplated by this Agreement (or if Parent determines in its reasonable judgment not to pursue such a hearing; provided that Parent shall consult with the Company prior to making such determination), the parties hereto agree to take all steps reasonably necessary, utilize all commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate with one another to have the issuance of the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger registered with the SEC on Form S-4 or a successor registration form (the "Registration Statement") by filing with the SEC as promptly as practicable after the decision to utilize the Registration Statement is made, the Registration Statement with respect to the Parent Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger, which shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent (but with advance copies provided to the Company for its review and comment, which such comments shall be promptly conveyed by the Company). Each of Parent and the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC. Each of Parent and the Company will notify the other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or additional information, and will supply the other party with copies of all correspondence between such party or any of its representatives and the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement. As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC, Parent shall file with the SEC an amendment to the Registration Statement and Parent and the Company shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as soon thereafter as practicable.

If the Stockholder Representative and Parent are unable to agree upon the amount of Net Liabilities within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, a nationally recognized independent accounting firm (the "Independent Accountant") shall be retained and review the Net Liabilities Certificate and make a determination as to the amount of Net Liabilities. Such determination shall be binding upon the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, and Parent, and Parent shall be entitled to indemnification therefor pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 of this Agreement. ARTICLE 6 TAX MATTERS 6.1 Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date. Parent shall permit the Stockholder Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholders shall reimburse Parent for Taxes with respect to such periods within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the balance sheet in the most recent Financial Statement (rather than in any notes thereto), as such reserve is adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company in filing their Tax Returns; provided, that Parent shall seek such reimbursement first from the Indemnity Escrow Shares. 6.2 Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company for Tax periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. The Stockholders shall pay to Parent within fifteen (15) days after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date, except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the balance sheet in the most recent Financial Statement (rather than in any notes thereto), as such reserve is adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in 56
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company in filing their Tax Returns; provided, that Parent shall seek such reimbursement first from the Indemnity Escrow Shares. For purposes of the preceding sentence, Taxes shall be allocated in the manner set forth in the last sentence of Section 10.2(a)(ii). 6.3 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company, the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company, the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company relating to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority, (B) to deliver or make available to Parent, within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, copies of all such books and records, and (C) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Parent, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company, the Stockholder Representative, the Stockholders, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records at such other party's expense. Parent and the Stockholder Representative further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). 6.4 Contest Provisions. If, subsequent to the Closing, any of Parent, the Company or the Subsidiaries of the Company receives notice of a Tax Contest with respect to any Tax Return for a Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, the Parent shall notify the Stockholder Representative of such notice. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided, however, that if any of the issues raised in such Tax Contest could have an impact on Taxes of the Company for a Tax period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period"), then the Stockholder Representative shall afford Parent the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of the portion of such Tax Contest which could have an impact on Taxes of the Company in any Post-Closing Tax Period. If the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but elect in writing not to do so, then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest, provided that Parent shall keep the Stockholder Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis and Parent shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the Indemnifying Parties' indemnification obligations under this Agreement without Stockholder Representative written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each 57
party shall bear its own costs for participating in such Tax Contest. "Tax Contest" means any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or judicial proceeding involving Taxes. 6.5 Reorganization Matters. (a) The parties intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. However, neither Parent nor the Company makes any representation or warranty to the other or to any Stockholder regarding the tax treatment of the Merger or whether the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under the Code. Each of the Company, the Stockholders and Parent acknowledges that it is relying on its own advisors in connection with the Tax treatment of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company, the Stockholders and Parent each agree to use their respective best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any actions which to their knowledge could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code. (b) This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). Each of Parent and the Company shall report the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. 6.6 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Stockholders when due, and the Stockholders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law, Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Stockholders shall (i) provide Parent with evidence satisfactory to Parent that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by the Stockholders and (ii) use their best efforts to provide Parent at Closing with a clearance certificate or similar document(s) which may be required by any state taxing authority to relieve Parent of any obligation to withhold any portion of the payments to the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement. 6.7 FIRPTA Certificate.

The representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the Closing Date, and claims based upon or arising out of such representations and warranties, as well as any claims based upon or arising out of any covenants and agreements herein or made hereunder, may be asserted at, any time before the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date for all representations and warranties (the "Claim Expiration Date"); provided, however, that the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.14 and 3.23 shall survive until, and Claims based upon or arising out of such representations and warranties, and claims pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(ii) hereof, may be asserted at any time prior to, the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Tax and Financial Statement Claim Expiration Date"). No investigation made by any of the parties hereto (whether prior to, on or after the Closing Date) shall in any way limit the representations and warranties of the parties. The termination of the representations and warranties provided herein shall not affect the rights of a party in respect of any claim made by such party in a writing received by the other party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period provided pursuant to a Claim Notice in accordance with the terms of this Article 10 herein. 10.2 Indemnification. (a) (i) General. Subject in all cases to the limits of Section 10.2(c) and Section 10.4, subsequent to the Closing, the Stockholders (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) at the Effective Time (the "Indemnifying Parties") shall indemnify Parent, its Affiliates, and each of their respective, officers, directors, employees, stockholders and agents ("Parent Indemnified Parties") against, and hold each of the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless from, any damage, claim, loss, cost, Tax, Liability or expense, including without limitation, judgments, settlements, interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation, response action, removal action or remedial action (collectively "Damages") incurred by any such Parent Indemnified Party, that are incident to, arise out of, in connection with, or related to, the breach of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement of the Company or any schedule hereto or in any certificate or instrument of conveyance delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to this Section 10.2(a)(i) unless a Claim is initiated prior to the Tax and Financial Statement Claim Expiration Date (for claims for breaches of representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.14 and 3.23 hereof) or the Claim Expiration Date (for all other claims). (ii) The Indemnifying Parties shall indemnify, save and hold the Parent Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any and all Damages incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting from or incident to (i) any Taxes of any of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company with respect to any Tax year or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date, to the extent allocable (as determined in the following sentence) to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date), except to the extent that such Taxes are reflected in the reserve for Tax Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown on the face of the balance sheets (rather than 62
in any notes thereto) contained in the most recent Financial Statements, as such reserve is adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns, and (ii) the unpaid Taxes of any Person (other than any of the Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would by payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date. The term "Damages" as used in this Section 10.2 is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against Parent Indemnified Parties, but includes Damages incurred or sustained by such Persons in the absence of third party claims. (b) Procedure for Claims. If a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2 (a "Claim") is to be made by a Parent Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Parent Indemnified Party claiming such indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Stockholder Representative promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event which the Company reasonably anticipates may give rise to Damages for which indemnification may be sought under this Section 10.2, and such Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the individual items of Damages, the basis for the anticipated liability and the nature of the breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement giving rise to such Damages. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except and only to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is damaged or prejudiced in any material respect by such failure, and then only to the extent thereof. In the case of a Claim brought pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) involving the assertion of a claim by a third party (whether pursuant to a lawsuit, other legal action or otherwise, but not including any Tax Contest, a "Third-Party Claim"), if the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party under the terms of its indemnity hereunder in connection with such Third-Party Claim, then (A) the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled and, if it so elects, shall be obligated at its own cost, risk and expense, (1) to take control of the defense and investigation of such Third-Party Claim and (2) to pursue the defense thereof in good faith by appropriate actions or proceedings promptly taken or instituted and diligently pursued, including, without limitation, to employ and engage attorneys of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to handle and defend the same, and (B) the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled (but not obligated), if it so elects, to compromise or settle such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. In the event the 63
Stockholder Representative elects to assume control of the defense and investigation of such lawsuit or other legal action in accordance with this Section 10.2(b), the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided that, if the named persons to a lawsuit or other legal action include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnified Party's cost, risk and expense (if such Claim represents Damages for which indemnification is due), to retain one firm of separate counsel of its own choosing. If the Stockholder Representative fails to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section 10.2(b) within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third-Party Claim has been asserted shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Stockholder Representative) have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Party's cost, risk and expense (if such Claim represents Damages for which indemnification is due), the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account of the Indemnifying Party; provided that such Third-Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written consent of the Stockholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event the Stockholder Representative assumes the defense of the claim, the Stockholder Representative shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in the event the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party shall keep the Stockholder Representative reasonably informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement of any Third-Party Claim effected pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 10.2(b) and for any final judgment (subject to any right of appeal). (c) Indemnity Escrow Shares Sole Recourse. With respect to each claim for indemnity under this Section 10.2, the liability of each Indemnifying Party shall be limited to his pro rata portion of the claim amount, in proportion to the proportionate ownership of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock immediately prior the Effective Date. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party's obligation to provide indemnification exceed the amount of such Indemnifying Party's interest in the Indemnity Escrow Shares (the "Damage Cap"); provided, however, that the Damage Cap shall not apply in the case of a claim related to a breach of the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.14 or 3.23 or a claim pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(ii). For purposes of determining the number of shares of Parent Stock to be delivered to a Parent Indemnified Party out of the escrow account, the Indemnity Escrow Shares shall be valued at the Closing Price. 10.3 No Right of Contribution. After the Closing, the Indemnifying Parties shall have no right of contribution against the Surviving Corporation for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company. 10.4 Threshold; Limitations on Indemnity. 64
With respect to Claims made pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i), the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover for any Damages from the Indemnity Escrow Shares until such time as the Damages claimed by the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to such Sections in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the aggregate value of the Indemnity Escrow Shares, valued at the Closing Price (the "Damage Threshold"), at which time the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for all such Damages, including the initial one percent (1%) thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Damage Threshold shall not apply in the case of a claim related to a breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.14 or 3.23 or in the case of a claim made pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(ii). 10.5 Stockholder Representative; Power of Attorney. (a) Stockholder Representative. In the event that the Merger is approved by the Stockholders, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any Stockholder, the Stockholder Representative shall for each Stockholder (other than stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their dissenters' rights under the DGCL) enter into the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and take all actions required or permitted under the Indemnity Escrow Agreement or this Agreement with respect to the interests and rights of the Stockholders with respect to the indemnity under this Article 10. Such agency may be changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative may not be removed unless holders of a majority of the Indemnity Escrow Shares agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted Stockholder Representative. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholder Representative may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority of the Indemnity Escrow Shares. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder Representative, and the Stockholder Representative shall not receive compensation for his services. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Stockholders. (b) Exculpation. The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Stockholders (other than stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their dissenters' rights under the DGCL) shall jointly and severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, which may be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Shares, if any, after all claims by the Parent Indemnified Parties have been satisfied. (c) Actions of the Stockholder Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative shall constitute a decision for all of the Stockholders for whom a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Shares otherwise issuable to them are deposited with the Depositary Agent pursuant to the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of such Stockholders, and the Depositary Agent and Parent may rely exclusively upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of every such 65
Stockholder. The Depositary Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative. ARTICLE 11 MISCELLANEOUS 11.1 Termination. (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time: (i) By the written agreement of Parent and the Company; (ii) By Parent or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before February 28, 2004 or if the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 7 or Article 8 on or before such date is or becomes impossible, other than due to a breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate; unless Parent has not received the Fairness Approval or if the parties have not received the requisite governmental Consents (set forth in Sections 7.3 and 8.3 herein), in which case such date shall be extended to April 30, 2004; (iii) By Parent or the Company if there shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect preventing consummation of the Merger.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     
In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Spinnaker Networks, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
     
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Spinnaker Networks, Inc. will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has experienced operating losses and has an accumulated deficit. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's continued existence as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations on a timely basis and obtaining financing and/or additional equity issuances as may be required (management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1). The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability of assets, or the amounts of liabilities, that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

1.     History and Nature of the Business
     
Spinnaker Networks, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in Delaware on December 14, 1999 and began operations in 2000. The Company is a developer of next generation network attached storage (NAS) solutions. The Spinnaker SpinServer is based upon a two-stage distributed file system, SpinFS, and enables cost-effective, nondisruptive management of multiple servers as a single storage pool over a LAN, MAN or WAN network.
     
On November 3, 2003, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Network Appliance, Inc. (NetApp). The agreement provides for Network Appliance, Inc.'s acquisition of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and the assumption of all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of the Company in exchange for NetApp common stock and options and warrants to purchase NetApp stock, respectively.
     
The Company is subject to the risks associated with emerging technology-oriented companies. Primary among these risks are competition and the ability to successfully develop and market its products and services.
     
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company has a stockholders' deficit of $52,553,655 and $37,868,836, respectively. In addition, the Company has a net loss of $14,684,819 and $15,824,707 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
     
The Company historically has obtained its working capital requirements through equity issuances to shareholders, advances from shareholders, from product revenue and from certain borrowing arrangements. Management has plans to increase the Company's revenues by expanding its customer base. This expansion is being executed through direct sales efforts and through efforts of its significant corporate partners in both domestic and foreign markets. The goal of this effort is to achieve sales levels sufficient to support and grow future operations, sales and product development. To the extent additional funding is needed, management believes it will be obtained through additional equity issuances. In addition, on November 3, 2003, the Company entered into a merger agreement to be acquired.
     
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets or the settlement of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's continued existence is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, debt, or equity financing.
2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     
Cash and Cash Equivalents
     
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Total cash equivalents were approximately $812,000 and $15,000,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash equivalents in 2003 and 2002 consisted primarily of marketable securities.
     
Accounts Receivable
     
The Company provides an allowance for bad debts in recognition of uncollectible accounts. All identified credit losses at December 31, 2003 have been provided for in the accompanying financial statements.
 
     
Financial Instruments
     
Fair values of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accrued compensation, and other accrued liabilities, approximate cost because of their short maturities.
     
Inventory
     
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market and primarily consisted of raw material as of December 31, 2003.
     
Property and Equipment
     
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (generally three to five years) of the individual assets. Depreciation expense amounted to approximately $1,615,000 and $1,248,000 during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes.
     
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
     
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, (SFAS No. 144). This Statement supersedes or amends existing accounting literature related to the impairment and disposal of long-lived assets.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
     
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the carrying value exceeds the sum of the assets' undiscounted cash flows, the Company estimates an impairment loss by taking the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets. No impairment charge has been recorded in any of the periods presented.
     
Research and Development
     
The costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, . The Company's current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model; as such, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods presented.
Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise Marketed
     
Revenue Recognition
     
The Company's revenue recognition policy is governed by Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, , issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The Company generates its revenues from the sale of network storage servers as well as from the provision of related services, including installation and training, consulting, customer support, and maintenance contracts. Revenues are recognized when all of the following are met:
Software Revenue Recognition
     
Persuasive Evidence of an Arrangement Exists
  It is the Company's customary practice to have a purchase order prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement.
     
Delivery Has Occurred
  The Company's product is physically delivered to customers, generally with standard transfer terms such as FOB shipping point. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are
 
essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred.
     
The Fee Is Fixed or Determinable
  Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond the Company's standard terms and practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized as the fees become due and payable.
     
Collection Is Probable
  Probability of collection is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis. Customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers' financial position and ultimately their ability to pay. If it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process, revenue is recognized upon cash receipt.
     
For arrangements with multiple elements, the Company allocates revenue to each element using the residual method as outlined in SOP 98-9, , based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items. The Company will defer the portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements until they are delivered. Vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately.
Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions
     
The Company's agreements include warranty provisions. The Company will accrue for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services.
     
A typical arrangement includes product and maintenance. Some arrangements will include training and consulting. Revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the contractual term. Revenue from training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed.
     
Advertising Costs
     
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $42,000 and $67,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     
Preoperating Costs
     
Costs incurred during the developmental stage, such as expenses associated with establishing markets and developing sources of supply, are expensed as incurred.
     
Income Taxes
     
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, (SFAS No. 109). Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.
Accounting for Income Taxes
     
Stock-Based Compensation
     
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 148, (SFAS No. 148), and the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123 permits the Company to continue accounting for stock-based compensation as set forth in APB Opinion No. 25, , provided the Company discloses the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share of adopting the full provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, the Company continues to account for stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and has provided the required pro forma disclosures.

The following table illustrates the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to employee stock-based awards (see Note 8).
 
     
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
     
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, which is wholly owned. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
     
Certain amounts in the prior year's financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
 
     
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, , in an effort to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of variable interest entities, including special-purpose entities or off-balance sheet structures. The consolidation requirements of FIN No. 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older entities (formed or relationships established prior to January 31, 2003) in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company believes the impact of FIN No. 46 on its financial position and results of operations will not be material, but the Company will continue to evaluate the impact of FIN No. 46.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
     
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, . This statement affects the issuer's accounting for three types of freestanding financial statements: mandatorily redeemable shares, put and forward purchase contracts that require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets, and certain obligations that can be settled in shares. This statement is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise effective for nonpublic companies for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2004. As a result of the characteristics of the Company's preferred stock, management of the Company believes the impact of adopting FASB No. 150 will not be material to the Company's financial statements.
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity
 
3.     Property and Equipment
     
Property and equipment at December 31, 2003 and 2002 consisted of the following:
4.     Capital Lease Obligations
     
The Company entered into an equipment leasing agreement on January 29, 2001, whereby the Company, from time to time, sells certain equipment (computer hardware, software, furniture and fixtures, and inventory) to a third party and then subsequently leases back the equipment. The total amount available to the Company under the agreement is approximately $3,700,000 until January 29, 2002. The Company received a total of $785,213 in sale-leaseback financing throughout 2002.
     
In September 2002, the Company entered into another equipment leasing agreement, which enables the Company to sell certain equipment to a third party and then subsequently lease back the equipment. The total amount available to the Company under the agreement is $3,500,000 until March 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company received $757,167 and $1,711,703 in sale-leaseback financing, respectively.
     
The assets and accumulated depreciation under these capital leases are included in property, plant, and equipment. Depreciation expense for assets recorded under these capital leases is included in depreciation expense.
5. Note Payable
     
On September 13, 2002, the Company entered into a loan agreement with GATX Ventures Inc. for $2,000,000. The agreement has a 36-month term and the interest rate on the debt outstanding under this facility is the 36-month U.S. Treasury note yield plus a spread of 8%. A summary of the Company's debt is as follows:
     
Included within the debt balance as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 is a debt discount totaling $71,046 and $172,094, respectively.
     
The scheduled minimum principal payments for periods subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2003 are as follows: 2004  $734,597 and 2005  $603,134.
 
     
In connection with the loan agreement, the Company issued 320,000 warrants to purchase Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, with an exercise price of $.75 per share. The warrants are exercisable, in whole or in part, through the later of ten years or five years after the closing of the Company's initial public offering (see Note 7).
6.     Capitalization
     Common Stock
     
In December 1999, 16,700,000 shares of $0.0001 par value common stock were issued to the founders of the Company for $668,000. The founders' common stock is subject to a repurchase option whereby the Company has the right to repurchase the common stock from the founders at the purchase price per share originally paid by the founders. One quarter ( 1/4) of the common stock was released from the Company's repurchase option on March 31, 2000 and one forty-eighth ( 1/48) of the common stock shall be released from the repurchase option on the last day of each calendar month thereafter until all of the stock has been released provided that the founders' employment or services have not been terminated prior to the date of any such release. Upon a change of control or a termination due to death or disability, an additional one-quarter ( 1/4) of the founders' common stock shall be released from the repurchase option.
     
During the period not to exceed 180 days following the effective date of the Company's initial public offering and during the period not to exceed 90 days following the effective date of the first follow-on public offering by the Company within twelve (12) months of the Company's initial public offering, or any other offering in which such founder sells any securities of the Company, the founders cannot, without the consent of the Company or its underwriters, directly or indirectly sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, grant any option to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of the founders' common stock.
     
During 2003, the Company repurchased 299,768 shares of restricted common stock for the original exercise price of $39,351.
     
As of December 31, 2003, the Company has 74,426,333 common stock shares reserved for future issuance of stock options, conversion of preferred stock and warrants.
     Series A Preferred Stock
     
On March 31, 2000, April 12, 2000, and June 29, 2000, the Company sold 14,466,073 shares, 53,571 shares, and 24,999 shares of $0.0001 par value Series A preferred stock (Series A), respectively, for net proceeds of $20,326,547. These proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.
     
So long as at least 5,000,000 shares of Series A are issued and outstanding, Series A has the following rights and privileges. Each share of preferred stock is currently convertible into approximately 1.3 shares of common stock, to be adjusted proportionately for future stock splits, stock dividends, etc. The preferred stock may be converted to common stock at any time by the holder and will be automatically converted to common stock if the Company conducts an initial public offering in which (i) the aggregate price paid for such shares is at least $20,000,000 and (ii) the price paid for the shares is at least $6.00 per share. If at any time the holders of more than 66 2/3% of preferred stock approve in writing the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock, then effective immediately all outstanding shares of preferred stock shall automatically convert to common stock.
     
Each holder of Series A has the right to vote as if the holder's shares of preferred stock had been converted to common stock at the then-current conversion rate.
     
The holders of Series A and the holders of common stock shall be entitled to receive dividends only, when and as declared by the Company's Board of Directors. Dividends on the Series A at the rate of $0.11 per share per annum (appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits
 
and the like) shall be in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on the common stock. In the event dividends are paid on any share of common stock, an additional dividend shall be paid on all outstanding shares of Series A in an amount equal per share (on an as-if-converted to common stock basis) to the amount paid on each share of common stock. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, $0 dividends were declared.
     
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive an amount per share equal to the original per share purchase price of $1.40 (subject to adjustment for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like) plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A preferred stock in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
     Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
     
During 2002, the Company issued 41,615,612 shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock (Series B) for net proceeds of $31,099,435 (net of $112,274 of expenses incurred in connection with the issuance).
     
Each share of Series B is currently convertible into one share of common stock, to be adjusted proportionately for future stock splits, stock dividends, etc. The Series B may be converted to common stock at any time by the holder and will be automatically converted to common stock if the Company conducts an initial public offering in which (i) the aggregate price paid for such shares is at least $30,000,000 and (ii) the price paid for the shares is at least $3.19 per share. If at any time the holders of more than 76% of preferred stock approve in writing the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock, then effective immediately all outstanding shares of preferred stock shall automatically convert to common stock.
     
Each holder of Series B has the right to vote as if the holder's shares of preferred stock had been converted to common stock at the then-current conversion rate.
     
The holders of Series B shall be entitled to receive dividends only, when and as declared by the Company's Board of Directors at the rate of $0.06 per share per annum (appropriately adjusted for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like) shall be in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on the Series A and common stock.
     
In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets or funds of the holders of Series A or common stock, an amount per share equal to the original per share purchase price of $.75 (subject to adjustment for any recapitalizations, stock combinations, stock dividends, stock splits and the like) plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. If upon the occurrence of such event, the assets and funds thus distributed among the holders of the preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment to such holders of the full aforesaid preferential amounts, then the entire assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series B preferred stock in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be respectively entitled.
     
The Company will, at any time after January 25, 2007, promptly following receipt of a written request signed by holders of no less than a majority of the Series B outstanding on the date of such written request, redeem all of the shares of Series B then outstanding, at a price equal to (a) the Series B original issue price ($.75 per share) plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) or (b) the fair market value of Series B through an independent appraisal. Upon written request, the redemption will occur in three equal annual installments, the first of which will be effected no later than January 25, 2007
 
and which will be equal to one third of the shares of Series B then outstanding, the second and third will be effected on January 25, 2008 and January 25, 2009, respectively, and will be equal to one third of the shares of Series B then outstanding. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded Series B stock accretion and dividends of $16,796,489 and $2,051,399, respectively.
7.     Warrants
     
As part of the consideration of entering into the sale-leaseback agreement in January 2001 (see Note 4), the Company issued a warrant to purchase 114,286 shares of the Company's Series A preferred stock. The warrant is exercisable at a price per share of $1.40. This warrant is exercisable for a period of up to seven years from the effective date of agreement or up to three years after an initial public offering, whichever is earlier. The fair value for the warrant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2001: volatility of 51%, dividend yield of 0.0%, risk-free interest rate of 5.25%, and an expected life of seven years. The fair value of the warrant issued was valued at $93,715 and was recorded as a reduction of the related capital lease obligation, and will be accreted back to the principal balance over the life of the obligation as a charge to interest expense.
     
In conjunction with the purchase of public relations services, in October 2001, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The fair value for the warrant at December 31, 2001 was calculated to be $16,000 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2001: volatility of 67.5%, dividend yield of 0.0%, risk-free interest rate of 3.59%, and an expected life of 3.75 years, of which $833 was recorded as marketing expense for the fair value of the portion of the warrant related to services that were provided as of December 31, 2001. During fiscal year 2002, the Company and the warrant holder agreed to terminate any future services, thus resulting in the cancellation of the warrant. The Company reversed the warrant value of $833 to additional paid-in capital.
     
As part of the consideration of entering into the sale-leaseback agreement in September 2002 (see Note 4), the Company issued a warrant to purchase 280,583 shares of the Company's Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock. The warrant is exercisable at a price per share of $.75. This warrant is exercisable any time through March 31, 2013. The fair value for the warrant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2002: volatility of 73.5%, dividend yield of 0.0%, risk-free interest rate of 3.92%, and an expected life of ten years. The fair value of the warrant issued was valued at $168,350 and was recorded as a reduction of the related capital lease obligation, and will be accreted back to the principal balance over the life of the obligation as a charge to interest expense using the interest method.
     
In conjunction with the loan agreement signed in September 2002 (see Note 5), the Company issued warrants to purchase 320,000 shares of Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $.75 per share. The fair value for the warrant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 2002: volatility of 73.5%, dividend yield of 0.0%, risk-free interest rate of 3.92%, and an expected life of ten years. The fair value of these warrants of $192,000 was recorded as a debt discount and will be amortized as interest expense over the repayment term using the interest method.
8.     Stock-Based Compensation
     
The Company has adopted the Spinnaker Networks, Inc. 2000 Stock Option Plan (the Plan) to aid in the recruitment and retention of key personnel. In 2003 and 2002, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of 7,075,000 and 625,000 shares for issuance under the Plan bringing the total shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 to 20,000,000 and 12,925,000, respectively. Options issued under this plan can take the form of either incentive or nonqualified stock options and are
 
subject to vesting or other limitations established by the Board of Directors. The plan options vest over a four-year period from the date of employment and terminate not later than ten years after the grant date.
     
During 2003, the Company granted stock options to certain employees below fair value and to a nonemployee for advisory services, which resulted in the recognition of $2,887,448 of deferred stock-based compensation. The deferred stock-based compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period. The employee grants were determined utilizing the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25. The nonemployee grant was for advisory services at an exercise price that approximated fair value at the date of grant. During 2003, the Company recognized compensation and consulting expense of approximately $424,773 and $195,000, respectively, related to these grants.
     
A summary of the Company's stock option activity is as follows:
     
The weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding options as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was 8 years and 8.5 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, 1,684,838 and 1,211,517 options were vested; however, all options can be exercised prior to vesting and converted to restricted common stock. When employees exercise unvested options, they are issued restricted stock with a vesting schedule identical to the original option grant. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, 22,870,168 and 22,602,508 shares of restricted common stock are issued and outstanding which includes 16,075,000 shares of the founders' restricted stock, respectively (see Note 6).
     
During 2003 and 2002, the weighted average fair market value of options as of the grant date under the Plan was $.34 and $.15, respectively.
     
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, , and related interpretations in accounting for its plans. Had compensation cost for the Plan been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, , the Company's net loss would have increased by approximately $540,000 and $40,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value for the options is estimated using the Minimum Value pricing model with the following assumptions for fiscal 2003 and 2002: dividend yield of

0.0%, assumed forfeiture rate of 0.0%, an expected life of ten years, and average risk-free interest rate of 3.30% and 4.09%, respectively.
9.     401(k) Plan
     
In 2000, the Company adopted a deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, employees who have attained 21 years of age may elect to defer up to 15% of their salary, subject to the Internal Revenue Service limits. Eligible employees may begin to make elective deferrals the first month following 30 days of employment. The Company may make a discretionary contribution. The Company made no contributions for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
10.     Income Taxes
     
Net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $20,533,988 and $15,163,969, respectively. A valuation allowance equal to this amount was established as these deferred tax assets will not be realized until the Company produces taxable income. The deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards and certain accruals and reserves not currently deductible for tax. The deferred tax liability is comprised of book/tax differences in depreciation. Federal net operating losses totaling approximately $49,790,857 begin to expire in the year 2020. State net operating losses of approximately $48,310,428 will begin to expire in the year 2008 through 2023. Utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, certain state tax restrictions will apply to the utilization amount and timing to the net operating loss carryforwards. The difference between the statutory rate and the effective tax rate of 0% is due to the change in the valuation allowance.
     
The components of the deferred tax asset are summarized below:
11.     Commitments and Contingencies
 
     
On April 30, 2001, the Company entered into a three (3) year operating lease for the Company's principal facility that expires on August 31, 2004. This lease is subject to a renewal option for three
 
(3) additional years beyond the additional term. The rental agreement contains a provision whereby the rental rates increase over the term of the lease. Additionally, in 2002 the Company leased space under a month-to-month operating lease. Rent expense for operating leases was approximately $203,521 and $192,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     
Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under capital leases and noncancelable operating leases at December 31, 2003 are as follows:
12.     Restructuring
     
In November 2001, the Company discontinued development of its 5000 Series product line. In connection with this decision, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $676,329 in 2001 consisting of $318,955 in termination benefits and $357,374 in asset write-downs. This restructuring charge is included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. Of the $318,955 in termination benefits, $122,500 was satisfied prior to December 31, 2001. The remaining $196,455, which was accrued for in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, was fully satisfied during fiscal year 2002.
13.     Other Income
     
During 2002, the Company received a $125,000 grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development to pay for job training and working capital at the Company's facility. The Company utilized these funds by December 31, 2002 and the grant was included in other income for the year ended December 31, 2002. If the Company does not remain in Pennsylvania for a period of five years from April 1, 2002 and have employees totaling at least 110 within three years from April 1, 2002, the state has the right to assess a penalty up to the amount of the grant; however, the Company considers the likelihood of its relocation and not meeting the employee hire requirements to be remote.

 
Exhibit 99.2
     
On February 18, 2004, Network Appliance Inc. ("Network Appliance") acquired Spinnaker Networks, Inc. ("Spinnaker") for approximately $305,523 (including estimated transaction costs) in an all stock transaction, through the merger of Nagano Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Network Appliance, with and into Spinnaker (the "Merger"). Spinnaker provides scalable system architectures, distributed file systems, next-generation clustering technologies, and virtualization. The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give pro forma effect to the Merger.
     
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet is presented as if the transaction had taken place on January 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations is presented to reflect the acquisition of Spinnaker as if it had occurred as of May 1, 2002 and May 1, 2003, respectively. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on the historical financial statements of Network Appliance and Spinnaker, giving effect to the transaction under the purchase method of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The pro forma adjustments are based on management's estimates and independent valuation of the value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.
     
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended January 30, 2004, combines Network Appliance's statement of operations for the nine months ended January 30, 2004 with the statement of operations of Spinnaker for its nine months ended January 31, 2004. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended April 30, 2003, combines Network Appliance's statement of operations for the year ended April 30, 2003 with the statement of operations of Spinnaker for the twelve months ended April 30, 2003.
     
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of Network Appliance, included in Network Appliance's Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2003 and in Network Appliance's Form 10-Q for the nine months ended January 30, 2004 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the historical financial statements of Spinnaker, included herein.
     
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired have been recorded at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition. These amounts have been recorded based upon preliminary estimates as of January 30, 2004. The unaudited pro forma financial data are based on the assumptions and adjustments available at the time of the filing of this Form 8-K/A, as described in the accompanying notes, which Network Appliance believes are reasonable. The fair value of the consideration will be allocated to the net assets acquired based upon the fair values of such net assets at the effective date of the acquisition. The allocation presented here is preliminary, subject to change as additional information is received.
     
The unaudited condensed combined pro forma statement of operations does not purport to represent what Network Appliance's results of operations actually would have been if the events described above had occurred as of the dates indicated or what Network Appliance's results will be for any future periods. The unaudited condensed combined pro forma financial statements are based upon assumptions, estimates and adjustments that Network Appliance believes are reasonable and are intended for informational purposes only. The future consolidated financial position and results of operations will differ, potentially significantly, from the pro forma amounts reflected herein because of a variety of factors, including access to additional information and changes in values not currently identified. Further adjustments to the acquired assets will be reflected as a change in goodwill. Moreover, the preparation of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements results in a different amount of goodwill than will be reported in the Network Appliance fourth quarter fiscal 2004 financial results.
 
     
Estimated direct transaction costs represent expenses incurred by Network Appliance directly related to the Spinnaker Acquisition, and are included in the total acquisition costs. The final amount of these costs may change and any related adjustments will be accounted for as a change to goodwill.
     
The unaudited pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies and related cost savings that could result with respect to the combined companies. The pro forma adjustments do not include any adjustments to historical revenue for any future price or product offering changes nor any adjustments to selling, marketing or any other expenses for any future operating changes.
 
 
 
 
1.     Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
     
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of Network Appliance have been prepared based on assumptions relating to the allocation of consideration paid to the assets and liabilities of Spinnaker based on preliminary estimates. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, , the acquisition is accounted for as a purchase of Spinnaker by Network Appliance. The estimated purchase price has been allocated based upon the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as determined through an independent valuation. Below are tables of the estimated acquisition costs and estimated purchase price allocation.
Business Combinations
2.     Pro Forma Adjustments
     
(a)
 Derived from Network Appliance's Form 10-Q filing as of and for the period ended January 30, 2004 and Form 10-K for the period ended April 30, 2003.
     
(b)
 Derived from Spinnaker's unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine-months ended January 31, 2004 and for the twelve months ended April 30, 2003.
 
     
(c) 
To record the estimated stock consideration, direct acquisition costs and applicable purchase accounting entries relating to the acquisition:
     
(d) 
To record additional deferred tax assets relative to net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits resulting from the acquisition against which Spinnaker previously recorded a full valuation allowance. Network Appliance fully expects to realize the deferred tax assets given its historical and expected operating results.
     
(e) 
To reflect the estimated direct transaction costs incurred on the acquisition. The adjustment to accrued liabilities is less than the estimated direct transactions costs of $2,911 that comprise part of the purchase price, as $828 of these costs were already incurred by Network Appliance and included in other assets, at January 30, 2004.
     
(f) 
To record estimated goodwill and identifiable intangible assets resulting from the allocation of the Spinnaker purchase price. Estimated intangible assets include acquired existing technology of $17,160, trademarks/tradenames of $280, customer contracts/relationships of $1,100 and covenants not to compete for $7,610. The amount of goodwill of $239,979 calculated for purposes of these pro forma financial statements is not the same as the amount of goodwill that was actually recorded at the closing of the acquisition on February 18, 2004 due to the differences in values of the net tangible assets between January 30, 2004 and February 18, 2004.
     
(g) 
To eliminate the $5,000 bridge loan made by Network Appliance to Spinnaker in accordance with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 3, 2003.
     
(h) 
To reduce Spinnaker deferred revenue to estimated fair value in accordance with Emerging Task Force Issue No. 01-03,
"Accounting in a Business Combination for Deferred Revenue of an Acquiree."
     
(i) 
To record the deferred stock compensation balance and amortization of stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options and restricted stocks assumed by Network Appliance. Deferred compensation, or unearned compensation cost, on assumed unvested stock options was based on the portion of the intrinsic value (market price less the exercise price) as calculated on February 18, 2004 related to the future vesting period of the stock options. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 44, , the market price used in the calculation of the intrinsic value was the closing price of Network Appliance's stock as quoted on the Nasdaq on February 18, 2004, which was $23.63. The deferred compensation balance related to unvested stock options and restricted stock will be amortized on a straight line basis into expense over the remaining vesting periods.
"Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB No. 25"
     
(j) 
To record the estimated amortization of identifiable intangibles resulting from the acquisition. The pro forma adjustment assumes that the identifiable intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis
 
over their estimated lives of 1.5 to 5 years. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 but instead is reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In the event that management determines that the goodwill has become impaired, the combined Company will incur an accounting charge for the amount of impairment during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
     
(k) 
To adjust the benefit for taxes to reflect the impact of the pro forma adjustments and assumed utilization of Spinnaker's losses by Network Appliance using the federal and state tax rates.
     
(l) 
To reflect the fair value adjustments to tangible assets acquired based on management estimates. To reduce Spinnaker property and equipment by $339, accounts receivable by $163 and other long-term assets by $178 to estimated fair value.
     
(m) 
To record deferred tax liabilities resulting from the basis difference in acquired intangible assets and the related income tax effects.
3.     Pro Forma Earnings per Share
     
The pro forma basic earnings per share is based on (1) the historical weighted average number of shares of Network Appliance outstanding, plus (2) approximately 12.4 million newly issued Network Appliance shares issued to former stockholders of Spinnaker upon the consummation of the transaction. The basic calculation gives effect to shares issued as if the transaction took place at the beginning of the periods presented.
     
The pro forma diluted earnings per share was based on the pro forma basic earnings calculations for each of Network Appliance and Spinnaker adjusted for the dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. The dilution for the assumed options of Spinnaker was calculated using the treasury method and was based on the number of stock options and the exercise price assumed by Network Appliance and adjusted by the option exchange ratio of 0.1471 for Spinnaker option holders. In addition, the remaining unearned deferred compensation recorded as a result of the Spinnaker acquisition was considered as proceeds for the purposes of the treasury stock method, which resulted in a lower number of dilutive share equivalents. The pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share are not indicative of future earnings per share results.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2005; Q1 Revenue Up 38% Year over Year; Eleventh Consecutive Quarter of Growth SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2004--Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $358.4 million, an increase of 38% compared to revenues of $260.5 million for the same period a year ago and a 6% increase compared to $337.0 million in the prior quarter. For the first fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 73% to $46.9 million, or $0.13 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $27.1 million, or $0.08 per share for the same period in the prior year.

"NetApp demonstrated exceptional execution, a strong balance sheet, and continued cash generation during the quarter. We continue to drive our solutions deeper into our customers' data centers and mission-critical areas to solve significant issues around business continuity, regulatory compliance, and high data availability," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "Our focus is on expanding our market share and our results demonstrate that the market is continuing to move toward us." Quarterly Highlights Throughout the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance reinforced its leadership position by deploying new tier-one storage solutions, expanding partnerships, and enhancing its storage grid architecture. Customers deploying NetApp during the quarter for a variety of database, collaborative, and other data center and mission-critical applications included Audi AG, Canon, Catholic Healthcare West, China Everbright Bank, Ciena, City of Concord, ConocoPhillips, Fujitsu LTD, Gap Inc., GE Healthcare, Hearst Corporation, ING BHF Bank, Pixar, Progress Energy, Qualcomm, Sprint, Telstra, and University of Georgia. All levels of enterprise customers have chosen to deploy NetApp for a variety of reasons -- reduced complexity, a low total cost of ownership (TCO), and advanced management capabilities made possible through Data ONTAP(TM) and a range of additional storage software packages that unleash the value of enterprise data. On the partners front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with McData, Ontrack Data Recovery, Oracle, Secure Computing, Symantec, Trend Micro, and VERITAS to address a variety of data concerns, including e-mail recovery, unified storage, and security issues facing enterprise customers. For storage grid architectures, the company continued to set the pace for the rest of the industry in iSCSI and IP SAN (storage area network), with more than 700 real-world production deployments to date, and reinforced its leadership in other storage application areas such as data protection/recovery, disk-based nearline storage, and database storage. In database storage in particular, NetApp demonstrated its prowess with large Oracle(R) deployments at Universal Tax Systems and the South China Morning Post and received a prestigious SAP Pinnacle Award for innovation around storage for SAP environments. Finally, Network Appliance also debuted its new midrange unified storage models, the FAS920 and FAS920c. Designed to provide affordable enterprise-class performance, reliability and advanced data management features for midrange applications, the FAS920 can power applications in Fibre Channel and iSCSI SANs and network-attached storage (NAS) simultaneously. In corporate news, Network Appliance recently announced that it is the recipient of a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) from the governor of North Carolina to assist in any expansion of newly acquired NetApp offices in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. NetApp also added two new members to its board of directors: Mark Leslie and George Shaheen.

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making such as employee compensation planning.

(NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenues for the second fiscal quarter were $375.2 million; an increase of 36% compared to revenues of $275.6 million for the same period a year ago and a 5% increase compared to $358.4 million in the prior quarter. For the second fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 14% to $55.3 million, or $0.15 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $48.4 million, or $0.13 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma(2) net income for the second fiscal quarter increased 74% to $58.4 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $33.6 million, or $0.09 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $733.6 million, compared to revenues of $536.1 million for the first six months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 37% year over year. For the first six months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 35% to $102.2 million, or $0.27 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $75.5 million, or $0.21 per share for the same period in the prior year.

"NetApp achieved strong growth across all product lines, segments, and geographies," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "NetApp is gaining momentum in the highest growth segments of the storage market by offering innovative and cost-effective solutions for today's IT challenges. Data ONTAP(TM) 7G, our next generation operating system announced yesterday, is an example of unique, breakthrough technology which empowers customers to do more with less. Data ONTAP 7G provides dynamic storage virtualization capabilities unmatched in the industry." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that revenue for the third quarter will grow sequentially by 7% to 9%. This projection reflects year over year growth rates of 35% to 38%. -- The company expects third quarter pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.15 to $0.16 per share. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share are projected to round to $0.15 per share. -- For the full fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish 35% to 37% higher than fiscal year 2004. -- Network Appliance estimates full year pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.60 to $0.61 per share. GAAP earnings per share are projected for fiscal year 2005 at $0.57 to $0.58 per share. Quarterly Highlights Throughout the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance reinforced its leadership position by introducing new security and compliance solutions, expanding partnerships, and continuing to grow iSCSI deployments. Customers deploying NetApp(R) solutions during the quarter for a variety of database, security, and other data center and mission-critical applications included Alyeska Pipeline, Anadarko, China Netcom, Consol Energy, Constellation Energy, the Federal Trade Commission, FMC Subsea Kongsberg, the General Services Administration, HypoVereinsbank, Jet Propulsion Labs (JPL), Nexan, Nokia, Rakuten, Saudi Aramco, Shamrock Foods, Siemens Business Services, Square Enix, The Times of India, Trader Media, the United States Air Force (USAF), and Voca Limited. A wide range of enterprise customers have chosen to deploy NetApp for a variety of reasons--reduced complexity, a low total cost of ownership (TCO), and advanced management capabilities made possible through Data ONTAP and a range of additional storage software packages that unleash the value of enterprise data. On the partners front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Computer Associates, Decru, FalconStor, Novell, Smartronix, Symantec, Vignette, and Websense to address a variety of data concerns, including Internet access and security, interoperability, data protection and recovery, storage and server consolidation and other business-critical initiatives facing enterprise customers. To help companies meet stringent data storage regulations, including regulations mandated by U.S. SEC Rule 17a-4, NetApp introduced a new software product--LockVault(TM). LockVault delivers powerful backup, disaster recovery, and data permanence capabilities for unstructured data, enabling customers to address both backup and compliance challenges with a single comprehensive solution. Companies can now leverage the same infrastructure to meet both their backup and compliance requirements. In the Internet security arena, NetApp released NetCache(R) 6.0 software to further enhance and strengthen its market-leading Internet access and security solution. NetCache 6.0 software helps guard against security threats, expands support for industry-leading security partners, minimizes virus and hacking risks, and accelerates and improves management of customers' Web and application information providing security, cost savings, and flexibility. Another iSCSI milestone was achieved this quarter with Siemens Corporate Research (SCR), a division of Siemens AG, becoming the 750th iSCSI customer deployment in IP SAN (storage area network) configurations. NetApp IP SAN solutions are an excellent choice for companies seeking to consolidate storage and server resources, maximize existing IT investments and headcount, and reduce complexity in the data center. The company was also honored by the Triangle Business Journal (North Carolina) as "one of the best companies to work for in the Triangle." Network Appliance employees based in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina, responding to a survey from the publication, gave the company high marks for its positive work environment, exceptional benefits package, strong executive leadership, and effective manager relationships.

Network Appliance Usage of Pro Forma Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2005; Generates a Record $148.5 Million in Cash from Operations SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 15, 2005--Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2005. Revenues for the third fiscal quarter were $412.7 million, an increase of 39% compared to revenues of $297.3 million for the same period a year ago and a 10% increase compared to $375.2 million in the prior quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 50% to $60.1 million, or $0.16 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $40.2 million, or $0.11 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma(2) net income for the third fiscal quarter increased 57% to $62.8 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $40.1 million, or $0.11 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.1 billion, compared to revenues of $833.3 million for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 38% year over year. For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 40% to $162.3 million, or $0.43 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $115.6 million, or $0.32 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma net income for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $171.1 million, or $0.45 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $102.4 million, or $0.28 per share for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. "This quarter's strong, well-rounded results demonstrate that our investments in sales, services and innovation are paying off, both in product and services revenue growth," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "Customers' increasing need for data protection, including compliance, disk-to-disk backup, and business continuity solutions, is one of the key drivers of our growth this quarter. In addition, we expect our leadership in emerging technologies such as iSCSI, virtualization, and the storage grid to increasingly contribute to our growth over the long term." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that revenue for the fourth quarter will grow sequentially by 6% to 9%. This projection reflects year over year growth rates of 30% to 33%. -- The company expects fourth quarter pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.16 to $0.17 per share. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share are projected at $0.16 per share. -- For the full fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish 35% to 36% higher than fiscal year 2004. -- Network Appliance estimates full year pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.60 to $0.62 per share. GAAP earnings per share are projected for fiscal year 2005 at $0.57 to $0.59 per share. Quarterly Highlights Throughout the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance reinforced its leadership position by introducing the latest version of its powerful enterprise storage software, expanding partnerships, and continuing to demonstrate leadership in the iSCSI market. Customers deploying NetApp(R) solutions during the quarter for a variety of database, security, and other data center and mission-critical applications included AIRBUS France, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, The Dow Chemical Company, GlaxoSmithKline, IKON Digital Express, Mayo Clinic, Mentor Graphics Corporation, NASA, Philips Semiconductors, RadioShack Corporation, Synopsys, Inc., and Time Warner Cable. Network Appliance achieved a critical milestone in expanding and delivering its storage grid vision by shipping the latest version of its powerful enterprise storage software, Data ONTAP(TM) 7G, during the third quarter. Customers using Data ONTAP 7G and its advanced virtualization capabilities can double their storage utilization, dramatically increase I/O performance for enterprise-class applications, and significantly reduce storage management costs for multi-application environments. The two primary new features of Data ONTAP 7G that offer users compelling benefits are FlexVol(TM) and FlexClone(TM) software. FlexVol creates dynamically virtualized, flexible data containers that eliminate performance and utilization tradeoffs and renders obsolete the notion of storage volumes being statically tied to specific physical or logical disks. In short, FlexVol is the feature of Data ONTAP 7G that provides dynamic virtualization. FlexClone enables the near-instantaneous creation of multiple, independently writable images of FlexVol data sets, with zero storage overhead. Competitive approaches for cloning data take up the same amount of storage space as the full original data set. FlexClone represents a breakthrough innovation for database applications and modeling. Additionally, the NetApp enterprise gFiler(TM) storage systems will now provide Fibre Channel data access and fully leverage the new enterprise storage virtualization capabilities in Data ONTAP 7G for multi-vendor storage environments. The NetApp gFiler solution has extended its storage systems support to include the HP(R) StorageWorks XP Disk Array family and the IBM(R) TotalStorage DS4000 series (formerly named "FAStT"), complementing existing support for Hitachi Data Systems(R), Hitachi Limited(R), Sun(TM) StorEdge(R) 9900 Disk Array family, and IBM Enterprise Storage Server disk array systems. During the quarter, NetApp also introduced the next addition to its data management software portfolio with SnapValidator(TM). SnapValidator can now be applied across the full line of NetApp storage systems, across any protocol, supporting the Oracle(R) Databases, adding to a robust, highly reliable, and available data environment. In the iSCSI arena, NetApp continued to drive iSCSI adoption. According to IDC, NetApp maintained a strong lead in the iSCSI SAN storage market for the third quarter of calendar year 2004 (3Q04). In its core NAS market, NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in NAS hardware for 3Q04 in both revenue and terabytes shipped. Also according to IDC, the company posted a 36.3% revenue market share, with a 13.8% increase in revenue year over year (vs. the third quarter of calendar 2003). On the partner front, the company achieved Gold Certified status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in Advanced Infrastructure Solutions recognizing NetApp expertise and total impact in the technology marketplace. NetApp also unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Alacritus Software, Atempo, CommVault Systems, Inc., NetEx, QLogic Corporation, Red Hat Inc., Secure Computing Corporation, Sophos, and Syncsort, Inc. to address a variety of data concerns, including Internet access and security, virtual backup, data management, virus protection, data protection and recovery, iSCSI software for Linux environments and other business-critical initiatives facing enterprise customers. In corporate news, NetApp executives, products and the overall company were honored for a variety of achievements. Chief Executive Officer Dan Warmenhoven was honored with the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year(R) 2004 Award in the technology category for his outstanding vision, leadership, and achievement as CEO of Network Appliance. Cited for its "unrivaled" unified storage architecture and its "unmatched" flexibility, scalability, and continuity in the storage industry, the Network Appliance FAS270c was named "Best NAS Solution of the Year" in InfoWorld's 2005 Technology of the Year honors. NetApp was also honored by FORTUNE magazine as one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" for the third consecutive year. This year, NetApp ranked at number 24, up from number 48 last year, reflecting the company's specific emphasis on attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry and continuing to demonstrate the values of what NetApp CEO Dan Warmenhoven calls a "model company." The elite and prestigious FORTUNE listing is largely determined by employee feedback.

Network Appliance Usage of Pro Forma Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 28, 2005, Jeffry Allen was elected to serve on the board of directors (the "Board") of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Company"). Under the Companys amended and restated 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), on the date of each annual stockholders meeting each non-employee Board member who is to continue to serve as a non-employee Board member is automatically granted a non-statutory option to purchase 15,000 shares of the Companys common stock (an "Automatic Option Grant"), provided such individual has served as a non-employee Board member for at least six (6) months as of that date. There is no limit on the number of such Automatic Option Grants any one non-employee Board member may receive over his or her period of Board service. Each Automatic Option Grant is contractually memorialized in the standard form of option agreement which the Board has approved for use under the Plan, which form is attached as an exhibit hereto. As more fully described in that form of agreement and in the Plan itself, which was previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an appendix to the Companys definitive proxy statement dated July 15, 2004, each Automatic Option Grant shall have, among others, the following features:  Shares subject to the Automatic Option Grant shall be purchasable at an exercise price per share equal to 100% of the fair market value thereof on the option grant date.  Each Automatic Option Grant shall carry a ten-year term measured from the option grant date.  Each Automatic Option Grant shall be immediately exercisable for any or all of the shares covered thereby. However, any shares purchased under the option shall be subject to repurchase by the Company, at the exercise price paid per share, upon the non-employee Board members cessation of Board service prior to vesting in those shares.  Shares subject to the Automatic Option Grant shall vest, and the Company's repurchase right with r espect to those shares shall lapse, upon the non-employee Board members continuation in Board service through the day immediately preceding the date of the next annual stockholders meeting following the option grant date.  A non-employee Board member (or, in the event of the non-employee Board members death, the personal representative of the non-employee Board members estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to the non-employee Board members will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution) shall have a twelve (12)-month period following the date of cessation of Board service in which to exercise each such option.  Should the non-employee Board member cease to serve as a Board member by reason of death or permanent disability, then all shares at the time subject to the Automatic Option Grant shall immediately vest so that such option may, during the twelve (12)-month exercise period following such cessation of Board service, be exercised for all or any portion of those shares as fully-vested shares of common stock.  The Automatic Option Grant shall, immediately upon the non-employee Board members cessation of Board service for any reason other than death or permanent disability, terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect to any and all shares in which the non-employee Board member is not otherwise at that time vested.  Each Automatic Option Grant shall be subject to 100% acceleration of vesting upon a change in ownership or control of the Company effected through either of the following transactions: (i) the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by any person or related group of persons (other than the Company or a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company), of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of securities possessing m ore than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the Companys outstanding securities pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made directly to the Companys stockholders; or (ii) a change in the composition of the Board over a period of thirty-six (36) consecutive months or less such that a majority of the Board members ceases, by reason of one or more contested elections for Board membership, to be comprised of individuals who either (A) have been Board members continuously since the beginning of such period or (B) have been elected or nominated for election as Board members during such period by at least a majority of the Board members described in clause (A) who were still in office at the time the Board approved such election or nomination.  Each Automatic Option Grant shall be subject to 100% acceleration of vesting upon either of the following stockholder-approved transactions to which the Company is a party: (i) a merger or consolidation in which securitie s possessing more than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power of the Companys outstanding securities are transferred to a person or persons different from the persons holding those securities immediately prior to such transaction; or (ii) the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Companys assets in complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers.
(b) On April 29, 2005, Jeffry Allen submitted to the Board a letter of resignation in which he resigned his position as the Companys Executive Vice President, Business Operations, effective as of June 3, 2005. (d) On April 28, 2005, based on the recommendation of the Companys Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the Board elected Jeffry Allen to fill the newly created vacancy on the Board (see Item 5.03 below). There are no arrangements or understandings between Mr. Allen and the Company or any other persons, pursuant to which he was selected as a director. There are no transactions, or proposed transactions, since the beginning of the Companys last fiscal year to which the Company was or is to be a party, in which Mr. Allen has a direct or indirect material interest. Mr. Allen is expected to become a member of the Companys newly formed Acquisitions Committee.
Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On April 28, 2005, the Board amended the Companys bylaws to increase the number of authorized directors on the Board from nine (9) to ten (10).

(Nasdaq:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005. Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter were $451.8 million, an increase of 34% compared to revenues of $337.0 million for the same period a year ago and a 9.5% increase compared to $412.7 million in the prior quarter. For the fourth fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 74% to $63.4 million, or $0.16 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $36.4 million, or $0.10 per share for the same period in the prior year. Pro forma(2) net income for the fourth fiscal quarter increased 53% to $66.6 million, or $0.17 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $43.5 million, or $0.12 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for fiscal year 2005 totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of 37% compared to revenues of $1.17 billion for fiscal year 2004. For fiscal year 2005, GAAP net income increased 48% to $225.8 million, or $0.59 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $152.1 million, or $0.42 per share for fiscal year 2004. Pro forma net income for fiscal year 2005 increased 63% to $237.7 million, or $0.62 per share, compared to pro forma net income of $146.0 million, or $0.40 per share for fiscal year 2004. "Fiscal 2005 was an outstanding year for Network Appliance. We achieved strong gains in revenue, captured additional market share, expanded gross margins, and broadened our offering of the most innovative products targeted at the areas of fastest growth in storage," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "Our continued investments in our business, combined with expanded partnerships with strategic vendors such as IBM, Microsoft, SAP, and VERITAS, lay the foundation for providing even greater value to our customers." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006 will grow sequentially by 3% to 6%. This projection reflects year-over-year growth rates of 30% to 33%. -- The company expects first quarter pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.17 to $0.18 per share. First quarter GAAP earnings per share are projected to finish at $0.16 to $0.17 per share. -- For the full fiscal year, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish 32% to 35% higher than fiscal year 2005. -- Network Appliance estimates full-year pro forma earnings per share to finish at $0.76 to $0.80 per share. GAAP earnings per share are projected for fiscal year 2006 at $0.73 to $0.77 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, Network Appliance reinforced its leadership position through a strategic original equipment manufacturing (OEM) relationship with IBM, increased growth in storage software and SAN, and continued leadership in the iSCSI and network-attached storage (NAS) markets. This quarter, NetApp and IBM entered into an OEM agreement that will enable IBM to sell IBM-branded solutions based on Network Appliance(TM) unified and open network attached storage NAS and iSCSI/IP SAN solutions, including NearStore(R) and NetApp V-Series systems, as well as associated software offerings. For more information, please see our April 6, 2005 press release posted on the NetApp Web site. Also this quarter, NetApp acquired Alacritus, a privately held company based in Pleasanton, California. The acquisition will extend the company's ability to provide a robust data protection solution to NetApp customers and help accelerate customer transitions to disk-based backup. Alacritus is best known for its Virtual Tape Library (VTL) software product, which makes disks emulate tape to provide high performance for large-scale backup environments without disrupting established tape backup workflow and processes. On the product front, NetApp announced the latest addition to its data management and virtualization portfolio, the NetApp V-Series family which unifies SAN, IP SAN, and NAS under a common architecture. V-Series systems enable customers to extend the complete suite of groundbreaking dynamic virtualization capabilities delivered in NetApp Data ONTAP(TM) 7G software to third-party storage products from HDS, HP, IBM, and Sun. The unique virtualization capabilities of V-Series systems translate directly into customer cost savings and a more intelligent, fluid approach to storage asset utilization that accommodates shifting business demands. V-Series systems facilitate a single, powerful, flexible management paradigm that replaces the cumbersome management procedures of conventional arrays. VERITAS Software Corporation and NetApp announced the availability of new integrated disk-based data protection and data management solutions for multi-vendor environments. The two companies integrated the latest version of VERITAS NetBackup(TM) software with NetApp NearStore storage systems and SnapVault software to help customers significantly reduce their backup and restore times with disk-based protection, while still retaining data on tape for long-term archival and disaster recovery -- all through a common management console. NetBackup 6.0 integration with NetApp storage provides cost savings when using NearStore single-instance storage capabilities to eliminate redundant heterogeneous backup data. Customers can now store hundreds of backups online with minimal storage. NetApp and VERITAS have also collaborated to integrate VERITAS Enterprise Vault(TM) 6.0 software with NetApp NearStore and SnapLock(TM) products. These integrated products offer powerful solutions to help mutual customers cope with growing compliance and regulatory requirements by delivering solutions that allow them to transparently archive data and quickly retrieve specific information as needed. NetApp demonstrated the strongest growth in storage software according to Gartner's report "Market Share: Storage Management Software, Worldwide, 2004."(3) The total market for new license revenue in 2003 to 2004 grew at a rate of 12.3%, with Network Appliance beating the market with a growth rate of 73.5% for the same period. NetApp showed the strongest market share growth among the top 10 vendors of storage software and has moved into the top five vendors for marketshare in 2004. For the second year in a row, this was the fastest growth rate among the top 10 vendors in the space and for the first year places NetApp in the top five with a total overall market share of 5.2%. NetApp maintained its leadership position in both the NAS and iSCSI storage markets for calendar year 2004 (CY2004). According to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q4 2004,(4) NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in its core NAS market, with a 36.9% revenue share and maintained its strong lead in the iSCSI storage market, with a 43% revenue share for CY2004. In addition, NetApp remained the leader in the IP storage market (NAS and iSCSI), posting a 37.3% market share in CY2004. Also according to IDC, the company grew revenue in the open systems networked storage market, with 29.7% year-over-year (fourth quarter 2003 to fourth quarter 2004) growth, versus overall market growth of 11.6%. NetApp grew revenue in the open SAN market at 98.9%, versus the market growth of 9.2%, year-over-year (fourth quarter 2003 to fourth quarter 2004). On the partner front, NetApp announced support of Microsoft(R) Windows(R) iSCSI Initiator 2.0. Support of the initiator demonstrates the rapid integration of NetApp storage solutions with the latest Microsoft Windows storage technologies. NetApp is among the first to support Microsoft's latest version of its iSCSI initiator, which underscores a continued vision by both companies to embrace the iSCSI protocol for the benefit of enterprise customers. NetApp also unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Asigra, Filenet, Maranti, Microsoft, Mobius, and Sun Microsystems to address a variety of data concerns, including simplifying SQL Server integration, content management, compliance, data backup and recovery, data management, security, and other business-critical initiatives facing enterprise customers.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Merger Agreement
On June 15, 2005, Network Appliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Registrant"), Dolphin Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant (the "Merger Sub"), and Decru, Inc., a Delaware corporation that develops and sells encryption software and appliances to secure network data storage ("Decru"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Decru will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Registrant (the "Merger").
At the effective time and as a result of the Merger, each share of Decru capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive that amount of cash and that number of shares of Registrant common stock as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Registrant has agreed to acquire all of the capital stock of Decru in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $265 million (which amount is subject to adjustment at the effective time based on certain expense and balance sheet items as set forth in Decru's financial statements immediately prior to the effective time), 80% of which will be paid in the form of Registrant common stock and 20% of which will be paid in the form of cash (such aggregate consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). The price of one share of common stock of Registrant to be used for purposes of determining the aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable to Decru securityholders shall be based on the average trading price of Registrant's common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending two trading days immediately prior to the effective time, subject to a collar. An amount equal to 12.5% of the Merger Consideration shall be subject to an escrow. The amount of consideration to be paid upon the consummation of the Merger for the outstanding capital stock of Decru was determined through an arms-length negotiation between Registrant and the stockholders of Decru together with their respective advisors. Options held by Decru employees to purchase Decru's common stock shall be assumed by Registrant.
Decru has made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger, (ii) not to engage in certain kinds of transactions during such period, (iii) to prepare an information statement to be distributed to the stockholders of Decru relating to the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (iv) subject to certain exceptions, for its board of directors to recommend adoption and approval by its stockholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (v) not to solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions and (vi) subject to certain exceptions, not to enter into discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with, alternative business combination transactions.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including (i) approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by the stockholders of Decru, (ii) absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii) expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period and receipt of certain foreign antitrust approvals, (iv) approval of the issuance of Registrant common stock either by the California Commissioner of Corporations or the Securities Exchange Commission, as the case may be, (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by both Registrant and Decru and (vi) the absence of any material adverse effect on Registrant or Decru.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, which will be subsequently filed and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
Network Appliance Acquires Decru
Extends Leadership in Data Protection Solutions, Expands Market Footprint for Heterogeneous Storage Support
Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Decru, a privately held company based in Redwood City, California, for approximately $272 million in cash and stock. Decru is a clear market leader in storage security, offering data protection solutions to address a range of needs for enterprises and governments, including regulatory compliance, privacy, secure consolidation, and outsourcing. Decru DataFort appliances protect the core of the storage network by seamlessly inserting a layer of strong encryption, authentication, access controls, and compartmentalization.
Sunnyvale, Calif.  June 16, 2005 
"In an era where data is a precious asset and security threats to that data are accelerating, encryption is a key element of any data infrastructure," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance, Inc. "Recent, highly public mishaps point to the need for companies and governments to more effectively protect sensitive business, employee, partner, customer, and intelligence data. Decru has established an early lead in the data security space. The combination of Decru with NetApp strengthens our own data protection portfolio and gives more customers the opportunity to purchase Decru products with the confidence that they'll get the support, service, and continuous innovation that distinguish NetApp in data management."
Over the last year, NetApp and Decru together have delivered many collaborative solutions designed to help companies and various government organizations safeguard their data and comply with a plethora of regulations that have recently taken effect. These solutions combine Decru DataFort appliances with NetApp storage. But Decru DataFort solutions are not limited to NetApp storage and in fact can be deployed transparently with a wide variety of vendors' storage systems in NAS, DAS, SAN, iSCSI, and even tape backup environments. Deploying Decru appliances requires no changes to servers, desktops, applications, or user workflow, making Decru solutions easy and fast for customers to integrate into their existing infrastructures.
Decru solutions provide encryption at wire speeds, enabling maximum protection with no performance sacrifice. And unlike firewalls and network security, which protect the network perimeter and "data in motion," Decru systems protect "data at rest" behind the firewall, which is where recent United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) studies show up to 80% of all data attacks occur.
For Network Appliance, the acquisition of Decru augments the company's already impressive lineup of data protection solutions including systems for disk backup and recovery; various SnapSuite software offerings for data replication, mirroring, and restoration; systems and associated software for protection from Internet viruses and attacks; and , which helps provide the technology foundation for safeguarding regulated data.

The acquisition also complements the recent NetApp acquisition of Alacritus and expands the company's ability to deliver advanced data protection solutions for hard disk storage as well as tape and virtual tape environments.
Finally, with Decru, NetApp continues to expand its ability to "front end" multivendor (or heterogeneous) storage systems from various third-party vendors in the storage arena. Just as the newly enhanced NetApp systems virtualize a myriad of storage systems, NetApp and Decru solutions are also capable of protecting data stored on third-party disk and tape systems.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Deferred Compensation Plan On June 30, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Company") approved the adoption of the Network Appliance, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of July 1, 2005. The Plan allows certain designated employees of the Company who are at the level of director or above to elect to defer between 1% and 100% of their base salary and to separately elect to defer between 1% and 100% of their incentive compensation. The deferred amounts will be credited to deferred compensation accounts for future payment to the participants. In addition, under the Plan the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to make discretionary contributions to the Plan for the benefit of select participants. The deferred compensation accounts are fully vested to the extent that they consist of amounts attributable to deferrals by the participants, but may be subject to a vesting schedule to the extent that they consist of amounts attributable to discretionary employer contributions. The deferred compensation accounts are credited with earnings based upon investment elections that the participants make from among various alternatives designated by the Company. Regardless of these investment designations, the deferred compensation accounts remain general obligations of the Company and the Plan is unfunded. At the time the deferral elections are made, participants choose when the amounts they chose to defer will be paid to them and whether the payments will be made in the form of a single lump sum or in installments. Notwithstanding the original election of the participant, in certain limited circumstances the elections may be changed and in certain limited circumstances distributions may be made early because of unforeseeable emergencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each participant will have his or her account balances automatically paid to him or her in a single lump sum within thirty (30) days following a change in control of the Company. The foregoing description of the Plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Plan, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 attached hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Subject to the following provisions, a Participant may elect, on the first Election Agreement that he delivers to the Committee pursuant to which amounts are credited to his Separation Sub-Account, to receive his Separation Sub-Account in cash in a single lump sum or in a number of approximately equal annual installments over a specified period not exceeding five (5) years.

In the event that no valid election is made regarding the Participant's form of distribution, the Participant's Account will be paid in cash in a single lump sum.
General
. Notwithstanding the form of distribution for a Sub-Account designated by a Participant on the first Election Agreement that he delivers to the Committee, a Participant may elect on a form provided by the Committee to change the form of payment of his Separation Sub-Account or his Inservice Sub-Account to a form of payment otherwise permitted under Section 2.6 hereof, and a Participant may elect to change the date of distribution of an In-Service Sub-Account (but not a Separation Sub-Account) to a date otherwise permitted under Section 2.5 hereof. Unless otherwise permitted under Section 409A of the Code, the subsequent election must comply with the following requirements: (a) such subsequent election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the subsequent election is made; (b) in the case of a subsequent election related to a distribution of deferred compensation other than a distribution described in Section 2.8 or 2.10 hereof, the first distribution under such subsequent election shall in all cases be deferred for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date such distribution would otherwise have been made; and (c) any subsequent election related to an In-Service Sub-Account must be made not less than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the first scheduled payment under the initial Election Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall disregard any subsequent election by a Participant to the extent such election would result in an acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment under the Plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
2.7. Subsequent Deferral Elections
In the event of the death of a Participant, the remaining amount of his Account shall be paid to his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries as described in this Section 2.8.
2.8. Death of a Participant.
(a) Each Participant shall designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries on a Beneficiary designation form provided by the Committee. A Participant's Beneficiary designation may be changed at any time prior to his death by the execution and delivery of a new Beneficiary designation. The Beneficiary designation on file with the Company that bears the latest date at the time of the Participant's death shall govern. If a Participant fails to properly designate a Beneficiary in accordance with this Section 2.8, then his Beneficiary shall be his estate.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision, upon the death of a Participant, the remaining balance in his Account shall be paid as follows. If the Participant dies after payment of his Account has commenced, the remaining balance of his Account will continue to be paid to his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in accordance with the payment schedule that has already commenced. If the Participant dies before payments from his Account have commenced, his Account will be paid to his Beneficiary or Beneficiaries in accordance with the form of payment elected by the Participant for his Separation Sub-Account, commencing as soon as administratively practicable following the date of the Participant's death.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any election made by the Participant, in the event that a Participant's Account has a balance of less than $20,000 on the date of his Termination of Employment, such Account shall be automatically paid to such Participant in a single, lump-sum payment as soon as administratively practicable following the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's Termination of Employment.
2.9. Small Payments.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency and at the request of a Participant or Beneficiary, accelerated payment shall be made to the Participant or Beneficiary of all or a part of his Account. Payments of amounts as a result of an Unforeseeable Emergency may not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy such Unforeseeable Emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution(s), after taking into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship).
2.10. Unforeseeable Emergencies.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, a Participant's active participation in the Plan shall terminate upon a determination by the Committee that the Participant is not a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of his employer, within the meaning of ERISA. The amounts allocated to such Participant's Account shall not be distributed to the Participant (or, in the case of his death, his Beneficiary) unless otherwise permitted by Section 409A of the Code. Upon such a determination, the amounts allocated to the Participant's Account shall be distributed to the Participant or his Beneficiary on the dates on which the Participant or his Beneficiary would otherwise receive benefits hereunder without regard to this Section 2.11; , , that to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may direct that the Participant or his Beneficiary receive an immediate lump sum payment equal to the amount credited to his Account.
2.11. Termination of Participation.
provided
however
Each Participant shall at all times have a nonforfeitable interest in his Account balance. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the portion of each Participant's Account, if any, attributable to Employer Contributions shall be subject to such vesting schedule as may be determined by the Company or Affiliate from time to time in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.13 hereof.
2.12. Vesting of Accounts.
The Company or any Affiliate may, in its discretion, provide contributions ("Employer Contributions") under this Plan with respect to one or more Participants. The amount, type and vesting schedule of such Employer Contributions, if any, shall be determined by the Company or Affiliate in its sole discretion. All Employer Contributions shall be credited to a Participant's Separation Sub-Account.
2.13. Employer Contributions.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each Participant shall receive a distribution of his Account in a single lump sum within thirty (30) days following such Change in Control.
2.14. Change in Control.
ADMINISTRATION
The Company, through the Committee, shall be responsible for the general administration of the Plan and for carrying out the provisions hereof. The Committee shall have all such powers as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan, including the power to (a) resolve all questions relating to eligibility for participation in the Plan and the amount in the Account of any Participant and all questions pertaining to claims for benefits and procedures for claim review, (b) resolve all other questions arising under the Plan, including any factual questions and questions of construction, and (c) take such further action as the Company shall deem advisable in the administration of the Plan. The actions taken and the decisions made by the Committee hereunder shall be final and binding upon all interested parties. In accordance with the provisions of Section 503 of ERISA, the Committee shall provide a procedure for handling claims of Participants or their Beneficiaries under the Plan. Such procedure shall be in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor and shall provide adequate written notice within a reasonable period of time with respect to the denial of any such claim as well as a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review by the Committee of any such denial.
3.1. General.
It is intended that the Plan comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, so as to prevent the inclusion in gross income of any amounts deferred hereunder in a taxable year that is prior to the taxable year or years in which such amounts would otherwise actually be distributed or made available to Participants or Beneficiaries. This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in a manner that effects such intent, and the Committee shall not take any action that would be inconsistent with such intent. Any provisions that would cause any amount deferred or payable under the Plan to be includible in the gross income of any Participant or Beneficiary under Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code shall have no force and effect unless and until amended to cause such amount to not be so includible (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code).
3.2. Compliance with Section 409A.
The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Compensation Committee of the Board, except that that no such action shall adversely affect any Participant or Beneficiary who has an Account, or result in any change in the timing or manner of payment of the amount of any Account (except as otherwise permitted under the Plan), without the consent of the Participant or Beneficiary; , , that the limitation requiring the consent of Participants or Beneficiaries to certain actions shall not apply to any amendment or termination that is deemed necessary by the Company to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Plan is terminated, the amounts allocated to a Participant's Account shall be distributed to the Participant or his Beneficiary on the dates on which the Participant or his Beneficiary would otherwise receive benefits hereunder without regard to the termination of the Plan; , , that to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may direct that the Participant or his Beneficiary receive an immediate lump sum payment equal to the amount credited to his Account.
provided
however
provided
however
Except as permitted by the Plan, no right or interest under the Plan of any Participant or Beneficiary shall, without the written consent of the Company, be (i) assignable or transferable in any manner, (ii) subject to alienation, anticipation, sale, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, garnishment or other legal process or (iii) in any manner liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of the Participant or Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, the Committee shall honor a judgment, order or decree from a state domestic relations court which requires the payment of part or all of a Participants' or Beneficiary's interest under this Plan to an "alternate payee" as defined in Section 414(p) of the Code.
5.1. Non-alienation of Deferred Compensation.
An Eligible Employee who is employed by an Affiliate (that has adopted the Plan) and who elects to participate in the Plan shall participate on the same basis as an Eligible Employee of the Company. The Account of a Participant employed by an Affiliate shall be paid in accordance with the Plan solely by such Affiliate to the extent attributable to Base Salary or Incentive Compensation that would have been paid by such Affiliate in the absence of deferral pursuant to the Plan, unless the Board otherwise determines that the Company shall be the obligor.
5.2. Participation by Employees of Affiliates.
5.3. Interest of Participant
(a) The obligation of the Company and the Affiliates under the Plan to make payment of amounts reflected in an Account merely constitutes the unsecured promise of the Company and the Affiliates to make payments from their general assets and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in, or a lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company or any Affiliate. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed as guaranteeing future employment to Eligible Employees. It is the intention of the Company and the Affiliates that the Plan be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. The Company may create a trust to hold funds to be used in payment of its and the Affiliates' obligations under the Plan, and may fund such trust; , , that any funds contained therein shall remain liable for the claims of the Company's and any Affiliate's general creditors.
provided
however
(b) In the event that, in the discretion of the Committee, the Company and/or its Affiliates purchases an insurance policy or policies insuring the life of any Participant (or any other property) to allow the Company and/or its Affiliates to recover the cost of providing the benefits, in whole or in part, hereunder, neither the Participants nor their Beneficiaries or other distributees shall have nor acquire any rights whatsoever therein or in the proceeds therefrom. The Company and/or its Affiliates shall be the sole owner and beneficiary of any such policy or policies and, as such, shall possess and may exercise all incidents of ownership therein. A Participant's participation in the underwriting or other steps necessary to acquire such policy or policies may be required by the Company and, if required, shall not be a suggestion of any beneficial interest in such policy or policies to such Participant or any other person.
The provisions of the Plan shall in no event be construed as giving any other person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right as against the Company or any Affiliate or the officers, employees or directors of the Company or any Affiliate, except any such rights as are specifically provided for in the Plan or are hereafter created in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Plan.
5.4. Claims of Other Persons.
The invalidity and unenforceability of any particular provision of the Plan shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the Plan shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted.
5.5. Severability.
Except to the extent preempted by federal law, the provisions of the Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
5.6. Governing Law.
The Plan is intended to serve the purposes of and to be consistent with any incentive compensation plan approved by the Committee for purposes of the Plan.
5.7. Relationship to Other Plans.
The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company expressly to assume this Plan. This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor of or to the Company, including without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company whether by sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor shall thereafter be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Plan), and the heirs, beneficiaries, executors and administrators of each Participant.
5.8. Successors.
The Company and its Affiliates may withhold or cause to be withheld from any amounts deferred or payable under the Plan all federal, state, local and other taxes as shall be legally required.
5.9. Withholding of Taxes.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, including any provision that requires the use of a written instrument, the Committee may establish procedures for the use of electronic or other media in communications and transactions between the Plan or the Committee and Participants and Beneficiaries. Electronic or other media may include, but are not limited to, e-mail, the Internet, intranet systems and automated telephonic response systems.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Preliminary First Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Results SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 4, 2005--Network Appliance, Inc. (Nasdaq:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today announced preliminary results for the fiscal year 2006 first quarter ending July 29, 2005. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $446 to $449 million, down approximately 1% sequentially from the fourth quarter of FY2005, and up 24% to 25% over the first quarter of FY2005. GAAP and non-GAAP(1) net income per share are expected to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.16. These preliminary results are below the company's previously stated targets issued on May 24, 2005 for a sequential revenue increase of 3% to 6% which equates to approximately $465 to $479 million, for GAAP net income per share of $0.16 and $0.17, and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.17 to $0.18. Network Appliance will announce final results on August 17, 2005 after the close of market. "The primary factor impacting our results this quarter was a product transition to our new midrange FAS3000 series. The market response to the new product line has been very positive, however the take up rates were more back-end loaded than we had planned," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "We remain confident in the competitiveness of our products and in our ability to grow our business over the long term."

Index to Exhibits Exhibit Description - --------- ----------- 99.1 Press release of Network Appliance, Inc. issued on August 17, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2005--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $448.4 million, an increase of 25% compared to revenues of $358.4 million for the same period a year ago and a decrease of 1% compared to $451.8 million in the prior quarter. For the first fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $60.1 million, or $0.16 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $46.9 million, or $0.13 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the first fiscal quarter was $62.1 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $49.9 million, or $0.13 per share for the same period a year ago. "With 25% revenue growth, we continue to grow significantly faster than the storage market and gain share. We are pleased with the success of our new FAS3000 midrange product line, despite the product transition issues that resulted in revenues a little short of our expectations," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "We are also encouraged by our growing relationships with partners, particularly IBM's recent introduction of their first product resulting from our OEM agreement." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that year-over-year growth in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2006 will be in the range of 25% to 28%. This projection reflects a quarter-over-quarter sequential growth rate of approximately 5% to 7%. -- The company expects second quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.17 and $0.18 per share. Network Appliance expects second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.19 per share. -- For the full fiscal year, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 25% to 28% higher than fiscal year 2005. -- The company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2006 to be between $0.74 and $0.77 per share. Network Appliance estimates full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.79 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, Network Appliance extended its leadership in data protection through a definitive agreement to acquire Decru, expanded its footprint in midrange storage and in global service offerings, and advanced its relationship with IBM in the virtualization and NAS markets. In this quarter, NetApp entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Decru, a privately held company based in Redwood City, California, for approximately $272 million in cash and stock. Decru, a market leader in storage security, offers data protection solutions to address a range of needs for enterprises and governments, including regulatory compliance, privacy, secure consolidation, and outsourcing. Decru DataFort(TM) appliances protect the core of the storage network by seamlessly inserting a layer of strong encryption, authentication, access controls, and compartmentalization. Since January 2004, NetApp and Decru have worked together to deliver solutions to customers in sectors including investment banking, healthcare, semiconductors, software, and the federal government. This acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal year 2006, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Also during the quarter, NetApp and IBM announced their intention to extend their strong relationship to encompass the growing technologies of virtualization and blade solutions. The focus is on combining IBM's storage virtualization technologies and the full line of NetApp V-Series and FAS storage systems into integrated solutions, signaling the beginning of efforts to collaborate to exploit the synergies between the companies' respective virtualization technologies. NetApp also announced that it plans to join IBM as one of nine founding members in the new Blade.org industry community. The community was conceived to enhance the relationships between the founding members and to serve as a catalyst for the industry to create new blade technology. NetApp is already providing back-end storage systems for IBM eServer(R) BladeCenter(TM). On the product front, NetApp unveiled two new midrange storage systems -- the NetApp FAS3020 and FAS3050 plus a new serial ATA (SATA) option for primary storage applications. Concurrently, NetApp debuted two new V-Series virtualization engines -- the NetApp V3020 and V3050. These new solutions, combined with Data ONTAP(TM) 7G software, address three significant customer pain points -- high storage acquisition costs, low storage resource utilization, and increasing storage management costs -- with elegant, powerful, and scalable solutions that help today's enterprise tailor its storage needs to its business and data demands. The new systems also significantly increase NetApp midrange performance. Additionally, NetApp debuted two new midrange NetCache systems -- the NetApp C2300 and C3300 -- to strengthen the company's Internet access and security solution for enterprise data centers. The C2300 and C3300 provide more midrange deployment options than the previous NetCache portfolio. The new systems double NetCache price performance compared to older NetCache systems. NetApp maintained its leadership in the Secure Content and Application Delivery market for the fourth consecutive time according to IDC's (3)Secure Content and Application Delivery 2005-2009 Forecast and Analysis, IDC# 33455. According to IDC, in 2004, NetApp captured 32.1% of the revenue market share and maintained a leadership position with its NetCache customer offerings, which include solutions for Internet access and security, streaming media, and business application acceleration. Overall, the secure content and application delivery market grew by 15% from 2003 to 2004. In service and support, NetApp announced a new generation of its service and support offering, ConsultingEdge, with six packaged consulting and integration services, designed to simplify complex storage and data management needs and speed time to production of NetApp solutions within customers' data infrastructures and the first support solution designed exclusively for government agencies, SupportEdge Secure for Government. NetApp SupportEdge Secure for Government is a highly customized service package that provides confidential and secure assistance in the support and management of NetApp storage solutions to both classified and nonclassified government agencies. With this offering, NetApp has designed a pioneering set of tools that allows filtering of restricted or classified information from government files prior to making them available for troubleshooting purposes. On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Arkivio, Decru, FileNet, Interwoven, Microsoft, SAP, and Symantec to address a variety of data concerns including bringing scalability to ILM, compliance, IP SAN support, content management, enhancing data protection and consumer data security, increased data recovery, SQL server support, enhanced storage management and other business-critical initiatives facing enterprise customers. In corporate news, NetApp was named by IDG's Computerworld as one of the "100 Best Places to Work in IT." NetApp ranked in fifth place on an impressive list of U.S. companies spanning several industries, based on employee feedback. NetApp also appointed Jeffry R. Allen to its board of directors. Allen transitioned to the board from his former role as the executive vice president of Business Operations at Network Appliance. Allen's appointment brought the number on the Network Appliance board to 10.

"Our enterprise customers, particularly those in government, financial services, and telecommunication markets, are extremely focused on data protection and security. Data theft and corruption have made a tremendous impact on businesses and consumers; as a result, information risk management has emerged as a top priority at the executive level," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "With the acquisition of Decru, NetApp is in a unique position to help customers address these risks with leading products that deliver simplicity, flexibility, and performance. As partners, NetApp and Decru have already built a successful track record of solving tough customer problems  as a combined team, I'm confident we can help a much broader set of customers address these challenges head on."
As Warmenhoven continued, "We want to reiterate to our customers and the industry that Decru will continue to work closely with the major storage and networking vendors. Our intent is to operate Decru as a separate business unit so it can collaborate with a broad range of partners on a business and technical level, while maintaining the confidentiality of their data and intellectual property. Our customers need security solutions to integrate seamlessly across heterogeneous environments, and Decru is the industry's only unified storage security platform that can deliver on this requirement."

Also according to IDC, NetApp experienced the fastest growth among the top five vendors in storage software with 49.4% year-over-year growth from Q2 2004 to Q2 2005 versus a market growth rate of 11.8% for the same period. Total NetApp market share in storage software grew from 5% in Q2 2004 to 6.6% in Q2 2005. Additional details are available in IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Storage Software Tracker Q2 2005. During the quarter, NetApp completed the acquisition of Decru, a privately held company based in Redwood City, California. The acquisition of Decru allows NetApp to offer the strongest security option in the industry. Decru is a clear market leader in storage security, helping enterprise and government customers address requirements including regulatory compliance, privacy, secure consolidation, and outsourcing. Decru DataFort(TM) appliances protect the core of the storage network by seamlessly inserting a layer of data encryption, authentication, key management, and compartmentalization. The first new products from Decru since the completion of the acquisition occurred during the quarter with the unveiling of next-generation storage security platforms. The new 10-port and SCSI models of Decru DataFort appliances, DataFort FC1020 and DataFort S115, deliver increased enterprise-class scalability native support for legacy tape environments, simplified management, and greater price/performance. Also this quarter, NetApp announced that it plans to join IBM as one of 10 founding members in a new open-source community, initially working under the project name Aperi, to give customers more choices for deploying open-standards-based storage infrastructure software. The organization plans to develop a common storage software management platform that will give customers greater flexibility in the way they manage their storage environments. Earlier this quarter, NetApp introduced NetApp(R) SnapManager(R) for Oracle(R) Database environments, which leverages the unique power of NetApp Snapshot(TM) technology and is a tightly integrated disk-based backup and granular recovery solution for Oracle customers using Oracle Automatic Storage Management technology. The solution provides customers with continuous uptime for online backups. NetApp SnapManager turns a multi-step backup and restore process into two simple commands from a single host machine. On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Bus-Tech Inc., Cisco, NeoPath Networks, Network Intelligence, NuView, Oracle, SAP, and Symantec to address a variety of data concerns, including management and monitoring of enterprise grid environments, data replication, enterprise compliance, ILM management, data analysis, file storage management and utilization, mainframe tape replacement, storage virtualization, and consolidation of remote office/branch office (ROBO) data. Also this quarter, NetApp and Kazeon, a leading provider of information classification and management solutions for the enterprise, signed an OEM, development, and marketing agreement to integrate the intelligent data classification and search capabilities of Kazeon's Information Server with Network Appliance(TM) storage systems. Additionally, NetApp will resell Kazeon's Information Server as part of a jointly marketed solution. In corporate news, NetApp expanded to a new facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. The company currently employs 360 employees in the Kit Creek Road facility and operates a 24x7 global service and support center in addition to a state-of-the-art data center with a capacity of multiple petabytes.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2006; Achieves 30% Year-over-Year Revenue Growth SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 15, 2006--Network Appliance, Inc.

For the third fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $76.4 million, or $0.20 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $60.1 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the third fiscal quarter increased 35% to $84.7 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $62.8 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.5 billion, compared to revenues of $1.1 billion for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 28% year over year. For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 28% to $207.2 million, or $0.54 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $162.3 million, or $0.43 per share for the same period in the prior year.

"NetApp achieved significant growth in revenue and profitability during the quarter, driven in large part by the compelling value proposition of our new FAS3000 midrange product line," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "We provide customers with the best storage utilization rates in the industry, allowing them to decrease their total cost of ownership and increase their return on investment. Combining this with the performance and ease-of-use inherent in our full line of systems and data protection solutions, we are seeing increased uptake of NetApp in data centers around the globe." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that year-over-year growth in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 will be in the range of 28% to 30%. -- The company expects fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.20 and $0.21 per share. Network Appliance expects fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.22 to $0.23 per share. -- For the full fiscal year, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 28% to 29% higher than fiscal year 2005. -- The company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2006 to be between $0.73 and $0.74 per share. Network Appliance estimates full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.81 per share. Quarterly Highlights This quarter, NetApp(R) was listed in the "leader" quadrant for midrange enterprise disk arrays in Gartner's research note, "Magic Quadrant for Midrange Enterprise Disk Array, 2H05."(3) NetApp SAN solutions provide an unmatched combination of high-performance, robustness, and ease-of-use for Windows(R), Solaris(R), HP/UX, IBM AIX, and Linux(R) computing platforms. Also this quarter, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q3 2005(4), NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in the iSCSI storage market, with number-one market share in capacity shipped (38.4%) and revenue (35.1%). NetApp maintained leadership in its core NAS market, with a 44.3% capacity share. Of the vendors tracked, NetApp posted the strongest year-over-year increase in FC SAN revenue, with a growth rate of 118%. Also according to IDC, NetApp experienced the fastest growth among the top five vendors in storage software with 49.4% year-over-year growth from Q2 2004 to Q2 2005 versus a market growth rate of 11.8% for the same period. Total NetApp market share in storage software grew from 5% in Q2 2004 to 6.6% in Q2 2005. Earlier in the quarter, NetApp unveiled its Uncompromised Security Initiative, a visionary program that challenges the status quo of data security and promises to deliver industry-best solutions to the enterprise. NetApp has numerous product lines shipping today that enable it to deliver uncompromised security, including Decru(R) DataFort(TM) storage security appliances, NetApp disk systems running Data ONTAP(R) security features, and NetCache(R) internet access and security appliances, as well as strong partnerships with leading vendors such as Symantec that enhance the security portfolio. The NetApp Uncompromised Security Initiative provides a vision and a roadmap for customers who expect best-in-class data management, coupled with military-grade security. In other product news, Network Appliance announced the NetCache C1300 system, the first enterprise Web security appliance delivering unmatched value for highly distributed environments and another component in the NetApp Uncompromised Security portfolio. Furthering the relationship with NetApp, this quarter IBM announced the introduction of the IBM(R) System Storage(TM) N5000, a new series of networked storage systems designed to help midrange customers dramatically reduce their total cost of ownership, particularly enterprises operating distributed networks across remote sites. The N5000 series represents the second major technology offering resulting from IBM's relationship with NetApp announced in April 2005. During the quarter, the FAS3020c was named "Best NAS Solution of the Year" in InfoWorld's 2006 Technology of the Year honors. This marked the second consecutive year that NetApp won Best NAS from InfoWorld. In 2005, the NetApp FAS200 series also received the award. On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Acopia Networks, Cisco, Microsoft and Network Intelligence to address a variety of data concerns, including backup and recovery, file virtualization, data migration, log management lifecycles, storage management and consolidation. In corporate news, NetApp was named by FORTUNE magazine as one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" for the fourth consecutive year. This year, NetApp again ranked in the top half of the list, at number 27, reflecting the company's emphasis on attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry and continuing to demonstrate the values of what NetApp CEO Dan Warmenhoven calls a "model company." Internationally, NetApp established a regional headquarters in Hong Kong as part of the company's continuing worldwide expansion and growth. The NetApp Hong Kong office will offer regional headquarters' functions to NetApp offices, distribution, channel and systems integrator partners in Asia Pacific, including Australia, Greater China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Southeast Asia. NetApp celebrated 10 years as a publicly traded company on November 21, 2005.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results and metrics for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and for all of fiscal 2006, statements regarding the anticipated benefits of our FAS3000 product line, our Uncompromised Security Initiative, and regarding our OEM relationship with IBM or our partner offerings and solution enhancements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include general economic and industry conditions, including expenditure trends for storage-related products; risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings, competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers; our ability to expand our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels; our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen our relationships with strategic partners; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other important factors as described in Network Appliance, Inc.'s reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the sections captioned "risk factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K and 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. (1) Earnings per share represent the diluted number of shares for all periods presented. (2) Non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, in process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments and the related effects on income taxes, as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. (3) Magic Quadrant for Midrange Enterprise Disk Array, 2H05 (4) IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q3 2005 NetApp, Data ONTAP, Decru and NetCache are registered trademarks and Network Appliance and DataFort are trademarks of Network Appliance Inc. in the United States and other countries. Decru DataFort is a trademark of Decru Inc., a Network Appliance company, in the United States and other countries. IBM is a registered trademark of IBM. All other trademarks belong to their respective owners and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials. The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments and the related effects on income taxes, as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items because they derive from unusual events that are not attributable to normal on-going operations and thus makes it more difficult for an investor to understand our recurring operational performance. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Loan Agreement On March 31, 2006, Network Appliance Global LTD., ("Borrower"), a subsidiary of Network Appliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Registrant"), entered into a loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement"), among the Borrower, the lenders from time to time party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Loan Agreement provides for term loans available in two tranches, a tranche of $220 million ("Tranche A") and a tranche of $80 million ("Tranche B"), for an aggregate borrowing of $300 million. The full amount of the term loans was advanced to Borrower at the closing. The proceeds of the term loans will be used to finance a dividend to Registrant. The Tranche B term loans amortize over 8 quarters, commencing July 31, 2006. The Tranche A term loans and Tranche B term loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, are due in full on the maturity date of March 31, 2008. The Tranche A term loans are required to be prepaid upon the maturity of t he investments securing the Tranche A term loans. Interest on the term loans accrues at a floating rate based on the base rate in effect from time to time plus, in the case of Tranche B term loans, a margin based on Borrowers leverage ratio, ranging from 0.0% to 0.125%, or at Borrowers election, at LIBOR plus, in the case of Tranche A term loans, a margin of 0.125%, and, in the case of Tranche B term loans, a margin based on Borrowers leverage ratio, ranging from 0.500% to 1.125%. Interest on the term loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period in the case of LIBOR loans (or quarterly if the interest period is longer than three months). The obligations of Borrower under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by Borrowers material subsidiaries. The Tranche A term loans are secured by certain investments held by Borrower, and the Tranche B term loans are secured by a pledge of accounts receivable by Borrower 019;s subsidiary, Network Appliance B.V. The Loan Agreement requires Borrower to comply with a liquidity ratio and, so long as any Tranche B term loans are outstanding, a leverage ratio. Additionally, the Loan Agreement contains affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements, covenants regarding conduct of business, payment of obligations, including taxes, maintenance of properties and insurance, inspection rights, compliance with applicable law and maintenance of collateral. Further, the Loan Agreement contains negative covenants limiting the ability of Borrower and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, grant liens, sell assets, make certain acquisitions, enter into mergers, change their business, make investments, enter into swap agreements, pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into restrictive agreements and prepay or amend the terms of subordinated indebtedness. The events of default under the Loan Agreement include payment defaults, misr epresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy events, judgments, certain ERISA events and changes of control. The foregoing description of the Loan Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Loan Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Registrants Annual Report on Form 10-K for period ending April 30, 2006.

Decru DataFort is a trademark of Decru Inc., a NetApp company. All other trademarks belong to their respective owners and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials. The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments and the related effects on income taxes, as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items because they derive from unusual events that are not attributable to normal on going operations and thus makes it more difficult for an investor to understand our recurring operational performance. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2007; Achieves 39% Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 16, 2006--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $621.3 million, an increase of 39% compared to revenues of $448.4 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 4% compared to $598.0 million in the prior quarter. For the first fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $54.7 million, or $0.14 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $60.1 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period in the prior year. This first quarter of fiscal year 2007 is the first quarter in which Network Appliance adopted the implementation of FAS 123R expensing of stock options in the GAAP results. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the first fiscal quarter increased 55% to $96.6 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $62.1 million, or $0.16 per share for the same period a year ago. "NetApp delivered another strong quarter, driven by strong growth in every region of the world," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "Our new products and new relationships are gaining momentum, and our business with enterprise customers reached record levels. Our results demonstrate that the NetApp value proposition resonates with customers and continues to drive our competitive success." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that growth in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 will be in the range of 2 1/2% to 4%, which translates to 32% to 34% growth year over year. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company expects second quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.13 and $0.16 per share. Network Appliance expects second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.26 per share. -- For the full fiscal year 2007, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 32% to 33% higher than fiscal year 2006. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2007 to be in the target range of $0.61 to $0.69 per share. Network Appliance estimates full-year non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.06 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, Network Appliance demonstrated value and leadership in the data center with new products and solutions for the enterprise, introduced the industry's first all-in-one solution for the small and medium business (SMB) market, and continued its leadership position in the iSCSI and network-attached storage markets. This quarter, NetApp challenged the largest storage competitors for data center leadership by introducing a new line of products and services designed to enhance customers' data management capabilities, offer the best total cost of ownership, and achieve the highest productivity. The FAS6030 and FAS6070, new flagship systems that greatly extend the breadth and scale of the NetApp storage systems portfolio, extend the NetApp FAS line to a substantially higher level of performance and scalability. Additionally, NetApp debuted an enhanced NetApp Manageability Software family and new Fibre Channel (FC) SAN capabilities as well as Premium Support Services for the FAS6070 and Rapid Deployment Services for Storage Implementation. Highlighting its greater value in data center environments, the expanded NetApp portfolio offers modular, transparent scalability for the largest data center applications and consolidations; maximum flexibility to help customers adapt to business changes; and the highest availability of application data, ultimately enabling more productivity for IT administrators and achieving the best overall total cost of ownership. These offerings are aimed at enterprises that have vast data requirements and demanding service-level agreements and that operate large-scale Oracle(R), SAP, and Microsoft(R) enterprise applications. During the quarter, NetApp announced the availability of its new Data ONTAP(R) GX operating system, giving customers with high-performance computing (HPC) applications extreme throughput, flexibility, and NetApp hallmark simplicity and reliability. Data ONTAP GX combines the global namespace functionality of SpinOS (acquired through the Spinnaker Networks(R) acquisition) with the key data management, performance, and high-availability features of Data ONTAP 7G. Although the needs of NetApp enterprise customers are well served by the performance, features, and functionality of Data ONTAP 7G, HPC customers in the areas of energy, entertainment, and electronic design automation have an insatiable demand for extreme levels of performance. Coupled with the new FAS6070 and/or FAS3050 systems, HPC customers can leverage the clustered file system technology inherent in Data ONTAP GX, which enables individual files or datasets to be striped across multiple nodes to achieve far greater performance than can be achieved with a traditional storage system. Data ONTAP GX, coupled with the new FAS6070, scales in capacity up to 6PB and achieves the unprecedented industry performance of more than one million operations per second, based on the SPEC SFS benchmark. During the quarter, NetApp unveiled the StoreVault(TM) S500, aimed at the small and medium business market segment. StoreVault S500 combines enterprise-proven storage technology from NetApp with the scalability, simplicity, security, and affordability that are missing in today's network storage solutions for SMBs. The StoreVault S500 is the industry's first scalable all-in-one network storage appliance for the SMB market segment that supports NAS, iSCSI SAN, and FC SAN, providing SMB customers unparalleled flexibility compared to direct-attached storage. Continuing disclosures of privacy breaches are driving requirements for enterprise-wide encryption and key management. This quarter, Decru, a NetApp company, unveiled a new key management platform, the Decru(R) Lifetime Key Management(TM) 3.0 Appliance (LKM Appliance). The LKM Appliance extends Decru's capabilities for secure, automated, enterprise-class management of storage encryption keys and adds integration capabilities for third-party encryption products. In other product news, NetApp was awarded Storage Vendor of the Year and NAS Product of the Year for the NetApp(R) NearStore(R) R200 storage system at the Storage Awards: The Storries III. Judged by the readers of Storage Magazine, the UK's leading IT storage magazine, the Storage Awards recognize excellence and innovation in the UK storage industry. From a market perspective, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q1 2006,(3) NetApp gained revenue share in the networked storage market, growing to a 9.6% share in Q1 2006, up from an 8.5% share at year-end 2005. NetApp also gained capacity share in networked storage, growing to 19.5% from 15.8% in the same period. In the FC SAN market, NetApp continued to grow faster than the market in both revenue and capacity, both sequentially and year over year. Sequentially, FC SAN market revenue dropped 12.9% while NetApp grew 17.4%. Year over year, the FC SAN market revenue grew 14.8% while NetApp grew 60.2%. In the NAS market, NetApp grew faster than the market in both revenue and capacity, both sequentially and year over year. Sequentially, the NAS market revenue dropped 1.5% while NetApp grew 7.3%. Year over year, the NAS market revenue grew 14.7% while NetApp grew 17.8%. NetApp continues to lead the NAS market in terms of capacity, with a 45.8% share in Q1 2006, up from a 42.6% share at year-end 2005. NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in the iSCSI market in terms of revenue and capacity, with first place market share for Q1 2006 in capacity shipped (40.0%) and in revenue (29.7%). In Q1 2006, the iSCSI market revenue dropped 7.2% sequentially, while NetApp grew 10.0%. Also this quarter, NetApp announced it has shown the strongest market share growth among the top 10 vendors of storage software and has moved into the top four vendors for market share in 2005. According to Gartner's report "Market Share: Storage Management Software, Worldwide, 2005,"(4) the total market for new license revenue in 2004 to 2005 grew at a rate of 8.8%, with NetApp beating the market with a growth rate of 42.3% for the same period. For the third year in a row, this was the fastest growth rate among the top 10 vendors in the space and for the first year places NetApp in the top four, with a total overall market share of 6.5%. On the partner front, NetApp unveiled several new solution enhancements and partner offerings with Attune Systems, Brocade, Cisco, Emulex, Microsoft, Symantec, and Reconnex, to address a variety of data concerns, including network file management, data content monitoring, data protection, and FC SAN scalability. In corporate news, NetApp entered into a definitive agreement to sell its NetCache(TM) business to Blue Coat Systems. Also during the quarter, Edward Kozel, a member of the Yahoo! board of directors and CEO of cRight, Inc., a developer of anti-piracy software, joined the NetApp board of directors.

All other brands or products are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 Achieves 35% Year-over-Year Revenue Growth SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 15, 2006--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. Revenues for the second fiscal quarter were $652.5 million, an increase of 35% compared to revenues of $483.1 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 5% compared to $621.3 million in the prior quarter. For the second fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $86.9 million, or $0.22 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $70.7 million, or $0.18 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the second fiscal quarter increased 38% to $108.9 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $79.1 million, or $0.21 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.27 billion, compared to revenues of $931.5 million for the first six months of the prior year, an increase of 37% year over year. For the first six months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income increased 8% to $141.6 million, or $0.36 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $130.8 million, or $0.34 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $205.4 million, or $0.53 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $141.3 million, or $0.37 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. "NetApp continues to gain momentum in enterprise data centers because we provide customers with the best value in the storage industry," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO. "Our performance this quarter highlights our success around the world as we increase our market share and expand our reach." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that sequential growth in revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 will be in the range of 7% to 8%, which translates to 30% to 31% growth year over year. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company expects third quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.17 and $0.18 per share. Network Appliance expects third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be about $0.28 per share. -- For the full fiscal year 2007, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 33% to 34% higher than fiscal year 2006. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2007 to be in the target range of $0.73 to $0.76 per share. Network Appliance estimates that full-year non-GAAP earnings per share will finish between $1.10 to $1.11 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, Network Appliance demonstrated growth in several key areas including market share, customer deployments, product lines, and functionality in archive and compliance, VTL, data migration and data retention. The company also continued its leadership position in the iSCSI and network-attached storage markets and showed strong growth in the Fibre Channel SAN market. In the second quarter, NetApp outlined its comprehensive strategy for a unified approach to both archive and compliance, offering a product and service portfolio to help customers solve their growing and changing data challenges. The NetApp announcement challenged the industry's conventional approach of forcing customers to deploy separate storage silos for their backup, archive, compliance, and primary storage needs and urged customers to save time, money, and manpower with a unified archive and compliance solution. The NetApp approach offers solutions to five standard storage needs to satisfy data management regulations including data classification, data discovery, data migration, data permanence, and data security and privacy. Evolving corporate governance policies and a heightened emphasis on storage efficiency demand that today's enterprise deploy archival solutions that will easily scale and adapt with changing business needs. E-mail leads the list of applications that are being archived in data centers around the world. This quarter, a study commissioned by NetApp and conducted by VeriTest found that Symantec(R) Enterprise Vault(TM) software for e-mail archival environments running on NetApp storage delivers customers up to twice the performance of EMC Centera Gen4 storage. The VeriTest study compared the performance of the NetApp(R) FAS3050 and NearStore(R) R200 storage systems to that of EMC Centera Gen4 storage. The results are further proof that NetApp storage provides customers with a fast, flexible, and cost-effective solution for e-mail archival and various compliance needs. Also on the product front, NetApp introduced three Virtual Tape Library (VTL) solutions designed for demanding data center backup environments. NearStore VTL300, VTL700, and VTL1400 provide customers with the ability to substantially increase backup and recovery service levels by doubling to tripling the amount of backup data that can be stored on disk while also increasing VTL write performance by over 50% compared to the industry-leading performance of existing NetApp VTL systems. From a market perspective, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q2 2006(3), NetApp led the networked storage market in capacity share, growing to 21%, which is a statistical tie with EMC. NetApp also grew faster than the market in capacity shipped in networked storage, growing at 111% year over year while the market grew at 59%. In terms of revenue, NetApp grew faster than the market from Q2 2005 to Q2 2006 at 21%, while the market grew at 11%. NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in the iSCSI market in terms of revenue and capacity in both Q2 2006 and the first half of 2006, with first-place market share for Q2 2006 in capacity shipped (44%) and in revenue (28%). In its core NAS market, NetApp was number one in Q2 2006 for capacity shipped, with 47% market share. Year over year, the NAS market grew 77% in terms of capacity shipped while NetApp grew 85%. Sequentially, the NAS market grew at 11.3% while NetApp grew at 13.5%. Of all the vendors tracked by IDC in Fibre Channel (FC) SAN, NetApp continues to grow faster than the market in both revenue and capacity, sequentially and year over year. For capacity shipped, NetApp grew at 240% year over year while the market grew at 47%. In terms of revenue, NetApp grew at 66% year over year while the market grew at 8%. In the SAN market, NetApp announced a new milestone this quarter with 10,000 production deployments of NetApp storage area network (SAN) solutions, including 3,000 FC SANs and 7,000 IP SANs. The NetApp SAN growth is the result of the company's innovative solutions which enable the easiest provisioning and management, affordable business continuity, and nondisruptive backups with instant data recovery in all data center environments -- central, departmental, and distributed. On the partner front, NetApp joined the Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) Alliance Member Program. As part of this program, NetApp storage has been installed in Microsoft Technology Centers worldwide. Additionally, NetApp announced that more than 5,000 enterprises worldwide use the Oracle(R) on NetApp solution to help simplify the management of their backup/recovery, archiving, data protection, compliance, and primary storage processes. In corporate news, Dan Warmenhoven received a CEO Ambassador Award from Boardroom Bound, a nonprofit organization that helps corporations identify and prequalify women and minority director candidates for corporate board service. Warmenhoven was honored for instilling the value of diversity at NetApp and on the company's board. NetApp was also honored for the third year in a row by the Triangle Business Journal as a "Best Place to Work" in Research Triangle Park (RTP) for 2006. NetApp earned first place honors in the large company category, which included companies with 150 employees or more. NetApp employees based in RTP who responded to a survey from the publication gave the company high marks for its team-oriented work environment, exceptional people practices, strong executive leadership, and effective manager relationships.

These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results and metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and for all of fiscal 2007; statements regarding our optimism for our 2007 fiscal year generally; statements regarding the anticipated benefits of our products, technologies, and services relative to the offerings of our competitors; and statements regarding anticipated benefits from partner offerings. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include general economic and industry conditions, including expenditure trends for storage-related products; risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; risks with new product introductions; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers; our ability to expand our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels; our ability to develop, maintain, and strengthen our relationships and product offerings with strategic partners; risks associated with international operations; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other important factors as described in Network Appliance, Inc. reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the sections captioned "Risk Factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K and 10-Q.

NetApp and NearStore are registered trademarks and Network Appliance is a trademark of Network Appliance, Inc. in the United States and other countries. All other brands or products are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Share Repurchase: As previously announced on November 15, 2006, Network Appliance, Inc.s (the "Registrant") Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of shares of its outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Registrant may purchase shares of its common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchases under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations and regulatory requirements. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. Pursuant to that authorization, on December 6, 2006, the Registrant entered into a Master Confirmation (the "Agreement") and on December 7, 2006, a Pricing Supplement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc ("JP Morgan") relating to a Capped Accelerated Share Repurchase Program. The Registrant will purchase a variable number of shares of its common stock from JP Morgan for an aggregate purchase price o f $241.8 million pursuant to a private capped accelerated share repurchase program. The final per share purchase price will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price of Registrants common stock over a specified period of time, with a cap based on JP Morgan's initial hedge price. In addition, the registrant will have no obligation to pay any further market purchase price adjustment under the program. The initial shares are expected to be delivered to the Registrant on December 13, 2006. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and recorded as a reduction in stockholders' equity on the Registrant's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Registrants outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of shares delivered. The Agreement contains other terms governing the program, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transaction, the settlement method, the circum stances under which JP Morgan is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Registrant and JP Morgan to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 14, 2006, Network Appliance Inc. ("the Company") entered into a $65.0 million financing, construction and leasing arrangement with BNP Paribas LLC ("BNP") for approximately 189,500 square feet of office space and parking structure to be located on land currently owned by the Company in Sunnyvale, California. Under the terms of the transaction documents, the Company has agreed to lease its land to BNP for a period of 50 years, as the construction manager for BNP, to complete construction of the office buildings and parking structure by approximately January 2009, and to lease the completed buildings and parking structure from BNP for a term expiring in December 2013. The lease can be renewed for up to two consecutive periods of five years each upon approval by BNP and satisfaction of the other conditions to extension set forth in the transaction documents. This lease arrangement requires the Company ("the Lessee") to pay minimum lease payments after completion of construction which vary ba sed on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread. In addition, the Company must pay certain fees (including, commitment and administrative agency fees), and, following completion of construction, all of the taxes, insurance, ground lease rent, maintenance, and repair costs with respect to the project. Upon the expiration of the term (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease term, the Company must elect one of the following options: (i) the Company may purchase the building and parking structure for $65.0 million, generally, the Break-Even Price, (ii) if certain conditions are met, the Company may arrange for the sale of the building and parking structure to a third party provided that the Company pays any deficiency between the sales proceeds and the Break Even Amount, up to a maximum $55.25 million, or (iii) the Company makes a supplemental payment to BNP equal to $55.25 million, in which event, the Company will have the opportunity to recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for the sale of the building during the ensuing 2 year period. In connection with the transaction, the Company has agreed to maintain specified financial covenants which include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and a Minimum Unencumbered Cash and Short Term Investments (the sum of the unrestricted cash and unencumbered short term cash investments and unencumbered marketable securities.) The foregoing description of the agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreements, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Registrants Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for period ending January 26, 2007.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On January 12, 2007, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Company") approved an increase in the annual base salary for Thomas F. Mendoza, the Companys President, and Robert E. Salmon, the Companys Executive Vice President, Field Operations. Effective January 29, 2007, Mr. Mendozas annual base salary will increase from $425,000 to $535,000, and Mr. Salmons annual base salary will increase from $400,000 to $450,000. The increase in annual base salary for the two executives was based on a recent review of the compensation for the following senior management positions by a compensation consultant engaged by the Committee: President, Executive Vice President of Field Operations and Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Based on the results of the consultants analysis, the Committee concluded that the current base salary and incentive compensation for Messrs. Mendoza and Salmon wer e below market (based on a review of peer companies) and below the Companys own compensation target range. In addition, based in part on the analysis of the consultant, the Committee approved an increase in the fiscal year 2007 target incentive compensation for Mr. Mendoza from 80% to 85% of his revised 2007 base salary and, for Mr. Salmon, from 60% to 80% of his revised 2007 base salary, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FY 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2007 Plan"), which the Committee adopted and approved earlier in fiscal 2007. The terms and conditions of the 2007 Plan are similar in all material respects to those set forth in the FY 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, filed as an exhibit to the Companys Form 8-K, filed on May 18, 2005. Accordingly, under the 2007 Plan, Messrs. Mendoza and Salmon (as well as the Companys other eligible executive officers) are eligible to receive annual performance-based cash compensation based on such individuals&# x2019; assigned target incentive compensation levels (expressed as a percentage of annual base salary) and the funding of the 2007 Plan, the funding of which will be determined based on the Companys operating profits for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2007 Achieves 36% Year-over-Year Revenue Growth SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 14, 2007--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Revenues for the third fiscal quarter were $729.3 million, an increase of 36% compared to revenues of $537.0 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 12% compared to $652.5 million in the prior quarter. For the third fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $66.5 million, or $0.17 per share(1)compared to GAAP net income of $76.4 million, or $0.20 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the third fiscal quarter increased 31% to $111.1 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $84.7 million, or $0.22 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $2.0 billion, compared to revenues of $1.47 billion for the first nine months of the prior year, an increase of 36% year over year. For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, GAAP net income totaled $208.1 million, or $0.53 per share, compared with GAAP net income of $207.2 million, or $0.54 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $316.5 million, or $0.81 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $226 million, or $0.58 per share for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. "Our third quarter performance again demonstrates that customers increasingly understand the NetApp data management value proposition," said Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive officer. "With revenues up 36% over Q3 of last year, and 100 petabytes of storage shipped during the quarter, NetApp is quickly becoming the vendor of choice for enterprise customers' storage and data management needs." Outlook -- Network Appliance estimates that sequential growth in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 will be in the range of 8% to 10%, which translates to 32% to 34% growth year over year. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123(R) and with current information and assumptions, the company expects fourth quarter GAAP earnings per share to finish between $0.19 and $0.20 per share. Network Appliance expects fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings to round to $0.30 per share. -- For the full fiscal year 2007, Network Appliance estimates that revenues will finish in the range of 35% to 36% higher than fiscal year 2006. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123(R) and with current information and assumptions, the company expects GAAP earnings per share for fiscal year 2007 to be about $0.73 per share. Network Appliance estimates full-year non-GAAP earnings per share will finish between $1.11 to $1.12 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, Network Appliance continued to enhance its data management and data protection portfolios with a key acquisition and several product announcements. It also extended its data center portfolio with several additions including new midrange platforms, broader Fibre Channel (FC) storage area network (SAN) capabilities and significant enhancements in the NetApp(R) Manageability Software Family. The company also continued to gain momentum in the storage area network (SAN) market while maintaining strong leadership in both the network-attached storage (NAS) and iSCSI markets. This quarter, NetApp completed the acquisition of Topio, a privately held Santa Clara, California-based company with R&D in Haifa, Israel. The acquisition continues to expand the NetApp data protection portfolio by adding heterogeneous disaster recovery capabilities to existing heterogeneous disk-to-disk backup solutions from NetApp. In addition to delivering a broader range of data protection, data migration, and data cloning capabilities, this acquisition expands the NetApp heterogeneous data protection portfolio by simplifying the replication of data from other storage arrays to NetApp storage systems. Also during the third quarter, NetApp extended its data center portfolio with the addition of its highest-performing midrange platforms, the FAS3070 and V3070 series; broader FC SAN capabilities; significant enhancements and introductions in the NetApp Manageability Software Family; and new professional services, all aimed at making enterprise data center management easier for customers who demand high-performance SAN solutions and increased application uptime to meet their business needs. From a market perspective, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q3 2006(3), NetApp gained share in both capacity shipped and revenue for the FC SAN market. NetApp also continued to grow faster than the market in FC SAN in both revenue and capacity, year over year. For capacity shipped, NetApp grew at 210.2%, while the market grew at 46.3%. In terms of revenue, NetApp grew faster than the market for the 11th consecutive quarter at 62.1%, while the market grew at 14.1%. Sequentially, NetApp grew at 16.0%, while the market grew at 6.4%. NetApp also demonstrated continued leadership in the NAS and iSCSI storage markets in the third quarter, according to IDC. NetApp maintained the number-one market share position in capacity shipped for NAS (42.0%) and in iSCSI for both capacity shipped (32.6%) and revenue (21.5%). In IDC's calculations of the network storage market (which includes SAN, NAS, and iSCSI), NetApp grew faster than the market, year over year, in both capacity shipped and revenue. For capacity shipped, NetApp grew at 106.8%, while the market grew at 62.6%. In terms of revenue, NetApp grew 18.9%, while the market grew at 17.2%. Also this quarter, NetApp continued its midrange leadership with the news that it has been positioned by Gartner, Inc., in the "Leaders" quadrant for midrange enterprise disk arrays in its research note, "Magic Quadrant for Midrange Enterprise Disk Array, 2H06"(4) . On the partner front, NetApp announced general availability of two software products in support of Microsoft(R) Exchange Server 2007. NetApp SnapManager(R) 4.0 for Exchange Server and NetApp Single Mailbox Recovery 4.2, a near-instantaneous backup and recovery software solution for Exchange Server 2007, provide customers with enterprise-class backup, recovery, and restoration solutions. With the availability of these products, NetApp is helping Exchange Server 2007 customers achieve near-instantaneous, granular recovery of Exchange Server data without a prohibitive--and expensive--increase in storage capacity needs. In corporate news, NetApp was named by FORTUNE magazine as one of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" for the fifth consecutive year. This year, NetApp ranked in the top 10 of the list, at number six, reflecting the company's emphasis on attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry and continuing to demonstrate the values of what NetApp CEO Dan Warmenhoven calls a "model company." Also this quarter, NetApp was named to Forbes magazine's "400 Best Big Companies in America" list for 2007. This quarter, Dave Hitz, EVP and cofounder of Network Appliance, was inducted into the CRN Industry Hall of Fame for developing a disruptive technology that altered the landscape of the storage industry. And finally, NetApp was honored as the 2006 Entrepreneurial Company of the Year by the Peninsula Chapter of the Stanford Business School Alumni Association.

Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, other acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges/recoveries, net gain/loss on investments, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provision for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Share Repurchase: As previously announced on November 15, 2006, Network Appliance, Inc.s (the "Registrant") Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of shares of its outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Registrant may purchase shares of its common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchases under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations and regulatory requirements. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. Pursuant to that authorization, on March 19, 2007, the Registrant entered into a Master Confirmation (the "Agreement") and a Pricing Supplement with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc ("JP Morgan") relating to a Capped Accelerated Share Repurchase Program. The Registrant will purchase a variable number of shares of its common stock from JP Morgan for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million pursuant t o a private capped accelerated share repurchase program. The final per share purchase price and the number of shares to be repurchased will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of Registrants common stock over a specified period of time, with a cap based on JP Morgan's initial hedge price. In addition, the registrant will have no obligation to pay any further market purchase price adjustment under the program. The initial shares are expected to be delivered to the Registrant on March 22, 2007. At the end of the specified period, the Registrant may receive additional shares should the VWAP for the period be below the cap price. Under a similar Master Agreement with J. P. Morgan, the Registrant repurchased 6.2 million shares of the Registrants common stock for $241.8 million during the three-months period ended January 26, 2007. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and recorded as a reduction in stockholders' equity on the Regi strant's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Registrants outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of repurchased shares when delivered. The Agreement contains other terms governing the program, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transaction, the settlement method, the circumstances under which JP Morgan is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Registrant and JP Morgan to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 23, 2007 the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Company") approved an increase in the annual base salary and an increase in the target incentive compensation for the Companys executive officers (including its named executive officers) for fiscal year 2008 in connection with the Committees annual review of compensation. The Committee approved increases in the fiscal year 2008 annual base salary, effective August 1, 2007, and increases in the fiscal year 2008 target incentive compensation, effective April 30, 2007, for the following named executive officers:  For Daniel J. Warmenhoven, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, a base salary increase from $750,000 for fiscal year 2007 to $800,000 for fiscal year 2008, and a target incentive compensation increase from 100% of his base salary for fiscal year 2007 to 130% of his base salary for fiscal year 2008;  For Steven J. Gomo, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, a base salary increase from $375,000 for fiscal year 2007 to $425,000 for fiscal year 2008, and a target incentive compensation increase from 60% of his base salary for fiscal year 2007 to 110% of his base salary for fiscal year 2008;  For David Hitz, Executive Vice President of the Company, a base salary increase from $350,000 for fiscal year 2007 to $400,000 for fiscal year 2008, and a target incentive compensation increase from 60% of his base salary for fiscal year 2007 to 110% of his base salary for fiscal year 2008;  For Thomas M. Mendoza, President of the Company, a base salary increase from $535,000 for fiscal year 2007 to $600,000 for fiscal year 2008, and a target incentive compensation increase from 85% of his base salary for fiscal year 2007 to 120% of his base salary for fiscal year 2008;  For Robert E. Salmon, Executive Vice President Field Operations of the Company, a base salary increase from $450 ,000 for fiscal year 2007 to $500,000 for fiscal year 2008, and a target incentive compensation increase from 80% of his base salary for fiscal year 2007 to 110% of his base salary for fiscal year 2008. The increase in annual base salary for the executives was based on an annual review of the compensation of senior management positions. Based on the results of the review, the Committee concluded that the current base salary and target incentive compensation for the executives was below market (based on a review of peer companies) and below the Companys own compensation target range. Also, in each case, this target incentive compensation is based on the FY 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2008 Plan"), which the Committee adopted and approved on April 23, 2007. The terms and conditions of the 2008 Plan are similar in all material respects to those set forth in the FY 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, filed as an exhibit to the Companys Form 8-K, filed on May 18, 2005. Accor dingly, under the 2008 Plan, the executive officers listed above (as well as the Companys other eligible executive officers) are eligible to receive annual performance-based cash compensation based on such individuals assigned target incentive compensation levels (expressed as a percentage of annual base salary) and the funding of the 2008 Plan, the funding of which will be determined based on the Companys operating profits for the fiscal year ending April 25, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2007 Q4 Revenues $801.2 Million, up 34% Year over Year; Fiscal Year 2007 Revenues $2.8 Billion, up 36% Year over Year SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 23, 2007--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007. Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter were $801.2 million, an increase of 34% compared to revenues of $598.0 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 10% compared to $729.3 million in the prior quarter. For the fourth fiscal quarter, GAAP net income increased 51% to $89.6 million, or $0.23 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $59.2 million, or $0.15 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the fourth fiscal quarter increased 28% to $114.2 million, or $0.30 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $89.3 million, or $0.23 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for fiscal year 2007 totaled $2.8 billion, an increase of 36% compared to revenues of $2.07 billion for fiscal year 2006. For fiscal year 2007, GAAP net income increased 12% to $297.7 million, or $0.77 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $266.5 million, or $0.69 per share for fiscal year 2006. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2007 increased 37% to $430.7 million, or $1.11 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $315.3 million, or $0.81 per share for fiscal year 2006. "Network Appliance had a great finish to a great year. With 36% annual growth, NetApp clearly provides to customers the best value in the industry," said Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive officer. "And while we weren't immune from the March macroeconomic spending slowdown, our competitive differentiation and business fundamentals have never been stronger." Outlook -- Network Appliance expects sequential revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 to decline by 6% to 7%, which translates to about 20% to 21% growth year over year. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company estimates that the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.14 to $0.15 per share. Network Appliance expects first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.24 to $0.25 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, NetApp broadened its Fibre Channel (FC) storage area network (SAN) portfolio and enhanced data management and data protection solutions with new products as well as broader and deeper partnerships. The company also continued to gain momentum in the SAN market while maintaining market leadership in both network-attached storage (NAS) and iSCSI. Continuing its extension into the data center, NetApp announced two new midrange platforms aimed at making enterprise data center management easier for customers. The NetApp(R) FAS3040 and NetApp V3040 series created additional market opportunities for NetApp as it broadened its enterprise lineup and added functionality for FC SAN environments. The NetApp FC SAN portfolio was further strengthened with the worldwide availability of new switches, including two new blades for the Brocade(R) 48000 Director, and the QLogic(R) SANbox(R) 9000 Core and SANbox 5600 Stackable Series of switches. NetApp expanded its enterprise-class software line with NetApp ReplicatorX(TM) and NetApp SnapManager(R) software for use with SAP(R) solutions. NetApp ReplicatorX (formerly Topio TDPS) provides continuous data replication and recovery across a range of locations and storage systems, including EMC, HDS, HP, IBM, and NetApp. NetApp SnapManager software for use with SAP enhances application availability and provides increased storage management flexibility in SAP environments. From a market perspective, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q4 2006(3), NetApp continued to grow faster than the market in FC SAN in both revenue and capacity, year over year. The company grew FC SAN revenue at more than seven times the rate of both the market leader and the overall FC SAN market, and grew FC SAN capacity at more than four times the rate of the overall market. In addition to FC SAN, NetApp continued to demonstrate leadership in the NAS and iSCSI storage markets, maintaining the number-one market share position in capacity shipped for NAS (38.9%) and in iSCSI for both capacity and revenue.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include our ability to build non-deferred backlog to levels consistent with our past results and to increase our revenue over the next several quarters; general economic and industry conditions, including expenditure trends for storage-related products; risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; risks with new product introductions; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers; our ability to expand our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels; our ability to develop, maintain, and strengthen our relationships and product offerings with strategic partners; risks associated with international operations; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other important factors as described in Network Appliance, Inc. reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the sections captioned "Risk Factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K and 10-Q.

All other brands or products are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, other acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges/recoveries, gain/loss on sales of assets and investments, certain other nonrecurring events, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Share Repurchase As previously announced on November 15, 2006, Network Appliance, Inc.s (the "Registrant") Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of shares of its outstanding common stock. Under the program, the Registrant may purchase shares of its common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchases under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations and regulatory requirements. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. Pursuant to that authorization, on May 24, 2007, the Registrant entered into a Master Confirmation and a Pricing Supplement (together the "Agreement") with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc ("JP Morgan") relating to a Capped Accelerated Share Repurchase Program. The Registrant will purchase a variable number of shares of its common stock from JP Morgan for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million purs uant to a private capped accelerated share repurchase program. The final per share purchase price and the number of shares to be repurchased will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of Registrants common stock over a specified period of time, with a cap based on JP Morgan's initial hedge price. In addition, the Registrant will have no obligation to pay any further market purchase price adjustment under the program. The initial shares are expected to be delivered to the Registrant on May 30, 2007. At the end of the specified period, the Registrant may receive additional shares should the VWAP for the period be below the cap price. Under similar Master Agreements with J. P. Morgan, the Registrant repurchased 11.8 million shares of the Registrants common stock for $441.8 million during the six-months period ended April 27, 2007. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and recorded as a reduction in stockholders' equity on the Regis trant's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Registrants outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of repurchased shares when delivered. The Agreement contains other terms governing the program, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transaction, the settlement method, the circumstances under which JP Morgan is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Registrant and JP Morgan to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The disclosure provided in Item 1.01 "Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement" is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03 as if fully set forth herein.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Preliminary First Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 Results SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 2, 2007--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today announced preliminary results for the first quarter of FY2008. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $684 to $688 million, down approximately 14% to 15% sequentially from the fourth quarter of FY2007 and up approximately 10% to 11% over the same quarter one year ago. GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 and non-GAAP(1) net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.20. These preliminary results are below the company's previously stated targets issued on May 23, 2007 for a sequential revenue decrease of 6% to 7%, which equates to approximately $745 to $753 million in revenue, and for GAAP net income per share of $0.14 and $0.15, and non-GAAP net income per share of $0.24 to $0.25. Network Appliance will host a conference call this afternoon to discuss these preliminary results. The final results of the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 will be announced on August 15, 2007, after the close of market. "We are disappointed with our Q1 results. We believe our performance was impacted by some continued softness in enterprise storage spending, most notably in our existing customer accounts in the U.S. and parts of Europe," said Dan Warmenhoven, CEO of Network Appliance. "However, these same enterprise customers who have slowed their spending tell us that our value proposition remains the best in the industry and we did not see any decline in our competitive win rates." Webcast and Conference Call Information -- The NetApp(R) preliminary results conference call will be broadcast live via the Internet at http://investors.netapp.com on Thursday, August 2, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time. This press release and any other information related to the call will also be posted on the Website at that location. -- The conference call will also be available live in a listen-only format at (800) 599-9829 in the United States and (617) 847-8703 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 84263943. -- A replay will be available for 72 hours following the completion of the live call by dialing (888) 286-8010 in the United States and (617) 801-6888 outside the United States, using replay code 16526483.

"Safe Harbor" Statement under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include the statements related to the final financial results that we expect to report for our first quarter of fiscal 2008. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the fact that final results for our first quarter of fiscal 2008 could vary materially because of any accounting adjustments made during our quarterly close. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. (1) Non-GAAP results exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, other acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges/recoveries, gain/loss on sales of assets and investments, certain other nonrecurring events, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. Network Appliance Usage of non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets, in-process research and development, stock compensation, other acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges/recoveries, gain/loss on sales of assets and investments, certain other nonrecurring events, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2007--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ: NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the first quarter and fiscal year 2008. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter were $689.2 million, an increase of 11% compared to revenues of $621.3 million for the same period a year ago and a decrease of 14% compared to $801.2 million in the prior quarter. For the first fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $34.3 million, or $0.09 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $54.7 million, or $0.14 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the first fiscal quarter was $76.0 million, or $0.20 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $96.6 million, or $0.25 per share for the same period a year ago. "We are clearly disappointed with our revenue growth this quarter, yet confident about our underlying business strength and continued health," said Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive officer. "Our bookings growth and cash flow are both very encouraging, and we are optimistic about getting back on track for higher growth in revenue and profits going forward." Outlook -- Network Appliance ("NetApp") expects revenue for the second quarter fiscal year 2008 to be between $752 million and $768 million, with year-over-year growth of 15% to 18% and sequential growth of 9% to 11%. -- Including the implementation of SFAS123R and with current information and assumptions, the company estimates that the second quarter fiscal year 2008 GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.16 to $0.18 per share. -- Network Appliance expects second quarter fiscal year 2008 non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.24 to $0.26 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, NetApp(R) continued to offer customer solutions to reduce power and manage costs and complexity in the data center through several new product announcements, membership in The Green Grid, and solution enhancements with key partners. The company also continued to gain momentum in all of its key storage markets, including software, services, Fibre Channel (FC) storage area network (SAN), network-attached storage (NAS), and iSCSI. This quarter NetApp set a new industry standard for deduplication technology by offering NetApp advanced single-instance storage (A-SIS) deduplication for NetApp NearStore(R) and FAS storage systems. This technology helps customers achieve the cost benefits of deduplication across a wide variety of environments, including backup, archival, compliance storage, and primary data sets as diverse as home directories and genomic data. The introduction of NetApp A-SIS deduplication provides customers with the ability to reduce capital expenditures and management costs by dramatically reducing the amount of storage they need to purchase and manage. The reduction in quantity of physical storage translates into savings in power and cooling costs and data center real estate costs. Strengthening customer data manageability, NetApp also enhanced both SnapDrive(R), for server storage management, and Virtual File Manager(TM) Enterprise Edition (VFM(R)-EE), for file data management, which customers leverage for increased productivity and flexibility by allowing application administrators to manage their data and react quickly to changing business conditions. From a market perspective, according to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q1 2007(3), NetApp gained revenue share in networked storage, growing to a 10.5% share in Q1 2007, up from a 9.3% share at year-end 2006. NetApp also gained capacity share in networked storage, growing to 20.4% from 17.5% in the same period. In Fibre Channel (FC) SAN, NetApp continues to grow faster than the market in both revenue and capacity, both sequentially and year over year. Sequentially, the FC SAN market revenue dropped 10.4%, while NetApp grew 12.6%. Year over year, the FC SAN market revenue grew 12.6%, while NetApp grew 103.0%. NetApp dramatically outpaced the FC SAN market in terms of capacity, growing at 263.7% year over year, compared to market growth of 57.1% during that period. In its core NAS market, NetApp grew faster than the market sequentially in terms of both revenue and capacity. Sequentially, the NAS market revenue dropped 8.0%, while NetApp grew 10.7%. NetApp continues to lead the NAS market in terms of capacity, with a 39.3% share in Q1 2007, up from a 32.4% share in Q4 2006. NetApp demonstrated continued leadership in the iSCSI market in terms of revenue and capacity, with first-place market share for Q1 2007 in capacity shipped (33.3%) and in revenue (24.3%). In Q1 2006, the iSCSI market revenue grew 8.6% sequentially, while NetApp grew 14.9%. In the storage software market, NetApp grew 10 times faster than the overall storage software market from Q4'06 to Q1'07 and maintained or gained share in each submarket segment in which it provides offerings. According to IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Storage Software Tracker Q1 2007(4), NetApp also maintained the number two market share position in the storage replication software market, closing the gap on the market leader. NetApp continued its leadership in storage services with a position in the Leaders quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Storage Services, Q2'07(5) report. In corporate news, NetApp was honored by the Boston Business Journal as a "Best Place to Work" in the Boston area for 2007. The NetApp New England office ranked number six in the mid-size company category, which included companies with 101 to 500 employees. NetApp was also recognized by Indiatimes Infotech, a leading technology media Website in India, as one of the "Best Tech Companies to Work For" in India for 2007. In other corporate news, NetApp received a second Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) from the State of North Carolina to expand its operations in Research Triangle Park.

Share Repurchase As previously announced, on August 14, 2007 the Board of Directors of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Registrant") approved a new stock repurchase program in which up to $1 billion worth of its outstanding common stock may be purchased. This approval is in addition to $200 million remaining from all prior authorizations. Under the program, the Registrant may purchase shares of its common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchases under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations and regulatory requirements. The purchases will be funded from available working capital. Pursuant to that authorization, on August 20, 2007, the Registrant entered into a Master Confirmation and a Pricing Supplement (together the "Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA") relating to a Capped Accelerated Share Repurchase Program. The Registrant will purchase a variab le number of shares of its common stock from BofA for an aggregate purchase price of $225 million pursuant to a private capped accelerated share repurchase program. The final per share purchase price and the number of shares to be repurchased will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of Registrants common stock over a specified period of time, with a cap based on BofA's initial hedge price. In addition, the Registrant will have no obligation to pay any further market purchase price adjustment under the program. The initial shares are expected to be delivered to the Registrant on or around August 23, 2007. At the end of the specified period, the Registrant may receive additional shares should the VWAP for the period be below the cap price. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and recorded as a reduction in stockholders' equity on the Registrant's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Registrants outstanding shares used to calculate earn ings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of repurchased shares when delivered. The Agreement contains other terms governing the program, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transaction, the settlement method, the circumstances under which BofA is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Registrant and BofA to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines. The foregoing description of the agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Master Confirmation, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Registrants Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending October 26, 2007.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Revolving Credit Agreement On October 5, 2007, Network Appliance Inc. ("Borrower"), a Delaware corporation, entered into a secured credit agreement (the "Agreement"), between the Borrower, the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Agreement provides for a revolving secured credit facility of up to $250 million with a term of five years from the effective date of October 5, 2007. The facility provides for an expansion option that will allow the Borrower to request an increase in the facility for an additional $250 million for a potential total commitment of $500 million. The Borrower may borrow, prepay without premium or penalty and reborrow such revolving loans as long as the sum of the outstanding principal amounts of the revolving loans is less than the aggregate facility availability. On October 10, 2007, $250 million was advanced to the Borrower. The proceeds of the revolving loans may be used by the Borrower for general corporate purp oses, including stock repurchases and working capital needs. Revolving loans may be, at Borrowers option, Alternative Base Rate borrowings or Eurodollar borrowings. Interest on Eurodollar borrowings accrues at a rate based on LIBOR for the interest period specified by the Borrower plus a margin. Interest on Alternative Base Rate borrowings accrues at a rate based on the Prime Rate in effect on such day. A commitment fee accrues at a predetermined rate on the average daily amount of the unused portion of the aggregate lenders commitment. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to Alternative Base Rate borrowings and at the end of an interest period in the case of Eurodollar borrowings (or quarterly if the interest period is longer than three months). The commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The obligations of Borrower under the Agreement will be guaranteed by any future material domestic subsidiaries and are secured by certain investment s held by Borrower in an amount of not less than the outstanding principal amount of the revolving loans. In the event that the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the revolving loans exceeds the value of the pledged investments, the Borrower is required to make a mandatory payment equal to such excess or to pledge additional collateral as security. The Agreement requires Borrower to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity. Additionally, the Agreement contains affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements, covenants regarding conduct of business, payment of obligations, including taxes, maintenance of properties and insurance, inspection rights, compliance with applicable law and maintenance of collateral. Further, the Agreement contains negative covenants limiting the ability of Borrower and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, grant liens, sell all or substantially all assets, enter into cer tain mergers, change their business, enter into swap agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into certain restrictive agreements. The events of default under the Agreement include payment defaults, misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy events, judgments, certain ERISA events and changes of control. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Borrowers obligations under the Agreement, an increase in the rate of interest, the exercise of rights and remedies provided to the administrative agent under the Agreement or at law or equity, and an obligation of any or all of the Borrowers material domestic subsidiaries to pay the full amount of the Borrowers obligations under the Agreement. The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Agreement, which will be fil ed as an exhibit to Network Appliance Inc.s Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending October 26, 2007.

Share Repurchase As previously announced, on August 14, 2007 the Board of Directors of Network Appliance, Inc. (the "Registrant") approved a new stock repurchase program in which up to $1 billion worth of its outstanding common stock may be purchased. Under the program, the Registrant may purchase shares of its common stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchases under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations and regulatory requirements. Pursuant to that authorization, on October 10, 2007, the Registrant entered into a Master Confirmation and a Pricing Supplement (together the "Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA") relating to a Capped Accelerated Share Repurchase Program. The Registrant will purchase a variable number of shares of its common stock from BofA for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million pursuant to a private capped accelerated share re purchase program. The final per share purchase price and the number of shares to be repurchased will be based on a discount to the volume weighted average price ("VWAP") of Registrants common stock over a specified period of time, with a cap based on BofA's initial hedge price. In addition, the Registrant will have no obligation to pay any further market purchase price adjustment under the program. The initial shares are expected to be delivered to the Registrant on or around October 12, 2007. At the end of the specified period, the Registrant may receive additional shares should the VWAP for the period be below the cap price. The repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and recorded as a reduction in stockholders' equity on the Registrant's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Registrants outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of repurchased shares when delivered. The Agreement contains other terms governing the program, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transaction, the settlement method, the circumstances under which BofA is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Registrant and BofA to one another, including representations related to Rule 10b5-1 and compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Senior Unsecured Credit Facility On November 2, 2007, Network Appliance Inc. ("Borrower"), a Delaware corporation, entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement (the "Agreement"), among the Borrower, the lenders party thereto, BNP Paribas, as syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. The Agreement provides for a revolving unsecured credit facility that is comprised of commitments from various lenders who agree to make revolving loans, swingline loans and issue letters of credit of up to an aggregate amount of $250 million with a term of five years from the effective date of November 2, 2007. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Borrower may, from time to time, borrow swingline loans in an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed a sublimit of $10 million and request letters of credit in an amount up to a sublimit of $50 million. The facility provides for an expansion option that will allow the Borrower to req uest an increase in the facility for an additional $250 million for a potential total commitment of $500 million, upon approval by the new lenders and the administrative agent. The Borrower may borrow, prepay without premium or penalty and reborrow loans as long as the sum of the outstanding principal amounts of the loans and the exposure under the letters of credit is less than the aggregate facility availability. As of November 8, 2007, no amount was outstanding under this facility. The proceeds of the loans may be used by the Borrower for general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases and working capital needs. The aggregate outstanding principal amount of revolving loans is due on the maturity date. The outstanding principal amount of swingline loans is due on the earlier of the maturity date and the first date after such swingline loan that is the 15th or the last day of any calendar month. Any amounts disbursed under a letter of credit are due promptly after notice of such disbur sement. Revolving loans may be, at Borrowers option, Alternative Base Rate borrowings or Eurodollar borrowings. Interest on Eurodollar borrowings accrues at a floating rate based on LIBOR for the interest period specified by the Borrower plus a spread based on the Borrowers leverage ratio. Interest on Alternative Base Rate borrowings, swingline loans and letter of credit disbursements accrues at a rate based on the Prime Rate in effect on such day. A facility fee accrues at a predetermined rate on the average daily amount of the aggregate lenders commitment. Such predetermined rate is based on the Borrowers leverage ratio applicable for that period. A participation fee on the letters of credit accrues at a floating rate based on LIBOR for the interest period specified by the Borrower plus a spread based on the Borrowers leverage ratio. A fronting fee will accrue for the letters of credit at a predetermined rate on the average daily amount of the letter of credit exposure. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to Alternative Base Rate borrowings and at the end of an interest period in the case of Eurodollar borrowings (or quarterly if the interest period is longer than three months). Interest on the swingline loans is payable the day that such loan is required to be repaid. The facility fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The participation fee and fronting fee is payable quarterly on the third business day following the last day of each quarter. The Agreement requires Borrower to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and to maintain a minimum amount of liquidity. Additionally, the Agreement contains affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements, covenants regarding conduct of business, payment of obligations, including taxes, maintenance of properties and insurance, inspection rights and compliance with applicable law. Further, the Agreement contains negative covenants limiting the ability of Borrower a nd its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, grant liens, sell all or substantially all assets, enter into certain mergers, change their business, enter into swap agreements, enter into transactions with affiliates, and enter into certain restrictive agreements. The events of default under the Agreement include payment defaults, misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy events, judgments, certain ERISA events and changes of control. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Borrowers obligations under the Agreement, an increase in the rate of interest, the exercise of rights and remedies provided to the administrative agent under the Agreement or at law or equity, and an obligation of any or all of the Borrowers material domestic subsidiaries to pay the full amount of the Borrowers obligations under the Agreement. The foregoing descri ption of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to Network Appliance Inc.s Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending January 25, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1 Network Appliance Announces Results for Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2008 SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2007--Network Appliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), the leader in advanced networked storage solutions, today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. Revenues for the second fiscal quarter were $792.2 million, an increase of 21% compared to revenues of $652.5 million for the same period a year ago and an increase of 15% compared to $689.2 million in the prior quarter. For the second fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $83.8 million, or $0.23 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $86.9 million, or $0.22 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the second fiscal quarter was $116.4 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $108.9 million, or $0.28 per share for the same period a year ago. Revenues for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.48 billion, compared to revenues of $1.27 billion for the first six months of the prior year, an increase of 16% year over year. GAAP net income for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $118.1 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $141.6 million, or $0.36 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $192.4 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $205.4 million, or $0.53 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. "The NetApp team delivered an outstanding quarter, with a combination of high revenue growth and good expense management," said Dan Warmenhoven, chief executive officer. "The revenue growth was driven by strength in U. S. Federal and much of Europe and Asia, and largely offset the continued sluggishness in U.S. enterprise spending. Our innovative solutions provide customers with higher utilization, simpler operations, and reduced costs, and those advantages enable us to continue to gain share in a more constrained spending environment." Outlook -- Network Appliance ("NetApp") expects revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 to be between $872 million and $883 million, with year-over-year growth of approximately 20% to 21% and sequential growth of approximately 10% to 12%. -- Including the effect of SFAS123(R) and with current information and assumptions, the company estimates that the third quarter fiscal year 2008 GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.23 to $0.24 per share. -- Network Appliance expects third quarter fiscal year 2008 non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.33 to $0.34 per share. Quarterly Highlights During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, NetApp brought the market a new storage system for Midsize Enterprise customers with the unveiling of the NetApp(R) FAS2000 series. The new solutions with deployment and auditing services are designed to help simplify data management and maximize IT investments for customers and offer them the ability to accomplish more with fewer resources. The architectural advantage of all NetApp storage systems, and the new FAS2000 series in particular, allows customers to readily consolidate direct-attached storage (DAS) into a single networked solution and scale on demand. NetApp also introduced the new StoreVault(TM) S300, an all-in-one storage solution for small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), with features and capabilities at a cost that had previously been unavailable to customers in this market segment. The StoreVault S500 was named a winner of the "Editors' Best Awards" in the storage category by Penton Media's Windows(R) IT Pro and was honored as a "Best Solution" at the Government Technology Conference (GTC) East 2007. NetApp strengthened its relationship with VMware, underscoring the fact that the value of server virtualization is dramatically increased with the addition of networked storage on the back end. To make disaster recovery more affordable, flexible, and simpler to manage for customers, NetApp integrated its data protection portfolio of solutions with VMware(R) Site Recovery Manager. Also during the quarter, leveraging its experience delivering simplified storage solutions for production grid environments, NetApp joined with Oracle on the development of the Direct NFS Client, a significant innovation included in Oracle(R) Database 11g(TM) that helps provide customers with improved performance, simplified management, increased flexibility, and better application availability. For channel partners, NetApp opened more service opportunities to NetApp VIP Program partners with a new Installation Accreditation initiative, giving partners the opportunity to sell NetApp installation services independently or utilizing NetApp best practices. The company also received a 2007 Rising Star award, presented by the Global Technology Distribution Council (GTDC), which recognizes the IT industry's fastest-growing manufacturers doing business with GTDC member distributors. In addition, channel partners and readers of CMP Technology's VARBusiness recognized NetApp for outstanding product innovation as evidenced by the Annual Report Card (ARC) award program. From a market perspective, NetApp gained share in both the storage software and hardware markets in the first half of 2007, as reported in IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Storage Software Tracker Q2 2007(3) and Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker Q2 2007(4). NetApp grew twice as fast as the overall storage software market from Q1'07 to Q2'07, and posted share gains across each submarket segment in which it provides offerings. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company outpaced the overall storage software market. IDC also found that in that time period NetApp grew fastest among the top five storage replication software vendors and that it currently holds the number two position. In addition, NetApp continues to lead the iSCSI market in terms of revenue and capacity, and gained both revenue and capacity share in the FC SAN market. NetApp also continues to lead in its core market of NAS in terms of capacity. In industry news, NetApp joined the newly created Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) Green Storage Initiative, dedicated to advancing energy efficiency and conservation in storage technologies in an effort to minimize the environmental impact of data storage operations. In corporate news, NetApp broke ground on an engineering lab facility located at the NetApp technology center in Research Triangle Park (RTP) to expand its engineering and development efforts in the region. Also, for the fourth year in a row, NetApp earned top workplace honors from the Triangle Business Journal, ranking as one of the top 15 "Best Places to Work" in RTP. The company was also honored as a "Top Corporate Philanthropist in Silicon Valley" by the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal. As part of the company's continuing worldwide expansion and growth, NetApp announced a strengthened commitment to the Asia Pacific (APAC) region with the inauguration of a new Technical Support Center (TSC) in Dalian, China, and by opening new manufacturing and logistics centers in Shanghai and Singapore, respectively, furthering the ability of NetApp to serve more customers and partners in the region.

NetApp is a registered trademark and Network Appliance and StoreVault are trademarks of Network Appliance, Inc. in the U.S. and other countries. All other brands or products are trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective holders and should be treated as such. Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related retention costs, gain on sale of investment, restructuring charges/recoveries, prior acquisition-related costs, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

This lease arrangement requires the Company ("the Lessee") to pay minimum lease payments ("base rent") beginning on January 2, 2008, which may vary based on a floating effective rate. The base rent may be, at the Companys option, based on London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread or Alternative Base Rate ("ABR"). For rent period subject to a LIBOR election, the base rent will be based on the LIBOR rate for the int erest period specified by the Company plus a spread based on the Companys leverage ratio. For base rent period that is subject to an ABR election, the effective rate will be based on the Prime Rate for such period. In addition, the Company must pay certain fees (including, arrangement, upfront fees and an annual administrative agency fees.) Upon the expiration of the term (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease term, the Company must elect one of the following options: (i) the Company may purchase the buildings for $90.4 million, generally, the Break-Even Price, (ii) if certain conditions are met, the Company may arrange for the sale of the buildings to a third party provided that the Company pays any deficiency between the sales proceeds and the Break Even Amount, up to a maximum $76.9 million, or (iii) the Company makes a supplemental payment to BNP equal to $76.9 million, in which event, the Company will have the opportunity to recoup some or all of such payment by arranging for the sale of the buildings during the ensuing 2 year period. In connection with the transaction, the Company has agreed to maintain specified financial covenants which include a maximum leverage ratio and a Minimum Liquidity. The foregoing description of the agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreements, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Registrants Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for period ending January 25, 2008.

The new solutions help maximize application-level availability and high storage utilization to reduce power, space, and cooling costs. These features, coupled with the NetApp unified storage architecture, offer incredible business value for enterprise customers.

Network Appliance Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related retention costs, gain on sale of investment, restructuring charges/recoveries, prior acquisition-related costs, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related retention costs, net gain on sale of investments, gain on sale of assets, restructuring charges/recoveries, prior acquisition-related costs, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 8.01 Other Events
     On June 3, 2008, NetApp, Inc. issued a press release announcing its intention to offer $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013. A copy of this press release is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
     NetApp, Inc. has updated its disclosure regarding its business. The revised disclosure is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.2 and incorporated herein by reference.
     NetApp, Inc. has updated its disclosure regarding its risk factors. The revised disclosure is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.3 and incorporated herein by reference.
     NetApp, Inc.'s preliminary financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended April 25, 2008 and its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended April 27, 2007 are filed herewith as Exhibit 99.4 and incorporated herein by reference. Certain financial information included in this Exhibit 99.4 relating to NetApp Inc.'s condensed consolidated balance sheet and statements of cash flow for its fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year ended April 25, 2008 have been updated from the May 21, 2008 earnings release furnished on Form 8-K on May 21, 2008 as a result of ongoing activities related to our 10-K preparation and evaluation of additional tax elections.
     As of January 25, 2008, NetApp, Inc. had 427,721,928 shares of common stock issued, including 84,515,286 shares of common stock held as treasury stock. These amounts differ from the amounts incorrectly reported on Form 10-Q for that quarter. Common stock was overstated, and Additional paid in capital was understated, by $85,000, respectively. This error had no impact on the reported dollar amounts of shareholder's equity as of that date, nor did it affect the number of shares shown as outstanding on February 22, 2008 or any other share-related disclosures within that Form 10-Q.
     On June 3, 2008, NetApp, Inc. sent an email to employees of NetApp, Inc. announcing the proposed offering of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2013, the substance of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.5 and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(d) Exhibits
Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
Sunnyvale, Calif.  June 3, 2008  NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) announced today that it proposes to offer $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, subject to market conditions and other factors. The notes would be due in 2013 and are to be offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. NetApp also intends to grant to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $165 million aggregate principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments.
The notes will be unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of NetApp, and interest will be payable semi-annually. The notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash up to the principal amount of the notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value, into shares of NetApp's common stock. The interest rate, conversion rate, offering price and other terms are to be determined by negotiations between NetApp and the initial purchasers.
NetApp also expects to enter into convertible note hedge transactions with counterparties, one or more of which may be affiliated with the initial purchasers of the notes (the "hedge counterparties"), and intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay for the convertible note hedge transactions. NetApp also expects to enter into separate warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties, and to use the proceeds of those warrant transactions to partially offset the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. NetApp anticipates that the warrants will have an exercise price that is approximately 70 percent higher than the closing price of NetApp's common stock on the date the warrants are issued. In connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties have advised NetApp that they or their affiliates may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock of NetApp and/or purchase common stock of NetApp or other securities linked to or referencing NetApp's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of the common stock of NetApp concurrently with or after the pricing of the notes. In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may from time to time, following the pricing of the notes, enter into or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock of NetApp and/or purchase or sell common stock of NetApp or other securities linked to or referencing NetApp's common stock in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so during any observation period relating to the conversion of the notes). These activities could have the effect of decreasing the price of the common stock of NetApp and could adversely affect the price of the notes during any observation period related to the conversion of notes.
NetApp expects to use (i) up to $275 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock in negotiated transactions with institutional investors, through one or more of the initial purchasers as its agent, concurrently with the offering, (ii) a portion of the net proceeds for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described above, after such cost is offset by the proceeds received from the warrant transactions described above, and (iii) any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, possible future stock repurchases, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. The repurchase of such shares in connection with the offering could have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the common stock above levels that would otherwise have prevailed, or preventing, slowing or delaying a decline in such price. If the initial purchasers exercise the over-allotment option, NetApp intends to use any proceeds therefrom to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and for general corporate purposes, and in such event also intends to enter into additional warrant transactions, which would result in the receipt of additional proceeds.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of NetApp common stock into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
The notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.
Cautionary Statement:
The statements in this release relating to the terms and timing of the proposed offering and the expected use of proceeds from the offering are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, whether or not NetApp will offer the notes or consummate the offering, the final terms of the offering, prevailing market conditions, the anticipated principal amount of the notes which could differ based upon market conditions, the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering which could change as a result of market conditions or for other reasons, the fact that future share repurchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations and the impact of general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally.
Stockholders of NetApp are cautioned not to place undue reliance on its forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made. NetApp does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or new information after this June 3, 2008 press release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

This storage grid architecture provides the ability to dynamically add storage resources and transparently redistribute data without disruption to client systems. We are in the process of integrating the Data ONTAP GX functionality with the core Data ONTAP capabilities and will ultimately converge both into a single operating system.
 
Data Management Software
          Our products are in use today in some of the largest data centers in the world. These environments require enterprise-class management tools. We provide management software to increase productivity and simplify data management. Such tools include:
Storage Management and Application Integration Software
          Our management software family of products provides a broad range of storage and data management tools to simplify IT administration and enhance flexibility and productivity. We deliver differentiated products and collaborate with industry open standards and interfaces to deliver this value to customers. We have four suites of products targeted to different IT administrative roles: Storage Suite, Server Suite, Database Suite and Application Suite.

NetApp Global Services
          Our customers demand high availability and reliability of their storage infrastructure to ensure the successful, ongoing operation of their businesses. NetApp Global Services ("NGS") are designed with this in mind. We provide professional services, global support solutions and customer education and training to help customers most effectively manage their data. The professional services and support solutions we offer help our customers to resolve business problems, reduce costs, keep businesses up and running continuously, comply with regulations and policies and improve
 
overall operational results. We utilize a global, integrated model to provide consistent service delivery and global support during every phase of the customer engagement, including assessment and analysis, planning, design, installation, implementation, integration, optimization, ongoing support and remote management and monitoring. Services and support often involve phased rollouts, technology transitions and migrations and other long-term engagements.
Principal Markets and Distribution Channels
          We market and sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world and, in March, 2008, we launched a global branding and awareness campaign to increase the visibility of NetApp in the broader IT market. Our diversified customer base represents a number of large segments and vertical markets. We focus primarily on the enterprise data management and storage solutions markets, offering an array of products from our ultra high-end products designed for large enterprise customers to our low-end products designed for SMBs. We have also expanded into the VTL and data encryption markets, bringing us into parts of the data center in which we have not previously competed. With our next-generation operating system, Data ONTAP GX, we offer storage grid architecture to high-performance computing environments.
          We employ a multi-channel distribution strategy, selling products and services to end users through a direct sales force, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and distributors. In North America, Europe and Australia, we employ a mix of resellers and direct sales channels to sell to end users. In Asia, Africa and South America, our products are primarily sold through resellers, which are supported by channel sales representatives and technical support personnel. No single customer or distributor accounted for 10% or more of our net sales during the nine months ended January 25, 2008 or during fiscal 2007 or 2006.
Seasonality
          As the size of our business has grown, we have begun to see a seasonal decline in revenues in the first quarter of our fiscal year. In addition, we also see some international seasonality, as sales to European customers are historically weaker during the summer months. Sales to the U.S. government are seasonally stronger during our second fiscal quarter, concurrent with the end of the U.S. federal government's fiscal year in September.
Backlog
          We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customers' demand. Orders are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. Products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order. In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. For these reasons, "orders" may not constitute a firm backlog and may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenues.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
          We have outsourced manufacturing operations to third parties located in Fremont, California; Livingston, Scotland; Shanghai, China; Singapore; Tao Yuan Shien, Taiwan; and Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands. These operations include materials procurement, commodity management, component engineering, test engineering, manufacturing engineering, product assembly, product assurance, quality control, final test and global logistics. We rely on a limited number of suppliers for materials, as well as several key subcontractors for the production of certain subassemblies and finished systems. We multi-source wherever possible to mitigate supply risk. Our strategy has been to develop close relationships with our suppliers, exchanging critical information and implementing joint quality programs. We also use contract manufacturers for the production of major subassemblies to improve our manufacturing redundancy. This manufacturing strategy minimizes capital investments and overhead expenditures and creates flexibility for rapid expansion. We were awarded ISO 9001 certification on May 29, 1997, and continue to be ISO 9001 certified. We were awarded ISO 14001 certification on December 8, 2004 and continue to be ISO 14001 certified.
Research and Development
          We conduct research and development activities in various locations throughout the world. In the nine months ended January 25, 2008 and in fiscal 2007 and 2006, research and development expenses represented 13.8%, 13.7% and
 
12.2% of our total revenue, respectively. These costs relate primarily to personnel and related costs incurred to conduct product development activities. Although we develop many of our products internally, we may acquire technology through business combinations or through licensing from third parties when appropriate. We believe that technical leadership is essential to our success and we expect to continue to commit substantial resources to research and development.
Competition
          In the storage market, our primary and near-line storage system products and our associated software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, HP, IBM and Sun Microsystems. In addition, Dell, Inc. is a competitor in the storage marketplace through its business arrangement with EMC, which allows Dell to resell EMC storage hardware and software products, as well as through Dell's recent acquisition of EqualLogic through which Dell offers low-priced storage solutions. In the secondary storage market, which includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance and business continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Sun Microsystems. Our VTL products also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backup/recovery space. Additionally, a number of small, newer companies have recently entered the storage systems and data management software markets, the near-line and VTL storage markets and the high-performance clustered storage markets, some of which may become significant competitors in the future.
Customer Base
          Our diversified customer base spans a number of large segments and vertical markets. Examples include: energy, financial services, government, high technology, Internet, life sciences and healthcare services, major manufacturing, media, entertainment, animation and video postproduction and telecommunications.

Exhibit 99.3
Risks Related to Our Business
Factors beyond our control could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate, which could adversely impact our common stock price.
          We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Many of the factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly in the future are beyond our control and include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
          In addition, sales for any future quarter may vary and accordingly be different from what we forecast. We manufacture products based on a combination of specific order requirements and forecasts of our customer demands. Products are typically shipped within one to four weeks following receipt of an order. In certain circumstances, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. Product sales are also difficult to forecast because the storage and data management market is rapidly evolving, and our sales cycle varies substantially from customer to customer.
          We derive a majority of our revenue in any given quarter from orders booked in the same quarter. Bookings typically follow intraquarter seasonality patterns weighted toward the back end of the quarter. If we do not achieve bookings in the latter part of a quarter consistent with our quarterly financial targets, our financial results will be adversely impacted. If revenues do not meet our expectations, our operating profit may be negatively impacted because portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time. If our revenues are lower than expected, our fixed expenses could adversely affect our net income and cash flow until revenues increase or until such fixed expenses are reduced to a level commensurate with revenues.
          Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in one or more quarters our results may fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In such event, the trading price of our common stock would likely decrease.
We cannot assure you that our OEM relationship with IBM will generate significant revenue.
          In April 2005, we announced a strategic partner relationship with IBM. As part of the relationship, we entered into an OEM agreement that enables IBM to sell IBM branded solutions based on NetApp unified solutions, including NearStore and the V-Series systems, as well as associated software offerings. While this agreement is an element of our strategy to expand our reach into more customers and countries, we do not have an exclusive relationship with IBM, and there is no minimum commitment for any given period of time; therefore, we cannot assure you that this relationship will contribute any revenue in future years. In addition, we have no control over the products that IBM selects to sell, or its release schedule and timing of those products; nor do we control its pricing. In the event that sales through IBM increase, we may experience distribution channel conflicts between our direct sales force and IBM or among our channel partners. If we fail to minimize channel conflicts, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.We cannot assure you that this OEM relationship will generate significant revenue or that this strategic partnership will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time.
If we are unable to maintain our existing relationships and develop new relationships with major strategic partners, our revenue may be impacted negatively.
          An element of our strategy to increase revenue is to strategically partner with major third-party software and hardware vendors that integrate our products into their products and also co-market our products with these vendors. We have significant partner relationships with database, business application, backup management and server virtualization companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Symantec and VMware. A number of these strategic partners are industry leaders that offer us expanded access to segments of the storage market. There is intense competition for attractive strategic partners, and even if we can establish relationships with these partners, we cannot assure you that these partnerships will generate significant revenue or that the partnerships will continue to be in effect for any specific period of time.
 
          We intend to continue to establish and maintain business relationships with technology companies to accelerate the development and marketing of our storage solutions. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in developing new relationships and maintaining our existing relationships, our future revenue and operating results could be impacted negatively. In addition, the loss of a strategic partner could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing resellers and attract new resellers and that channel conflicts will not materially adversely affect our channel relationships. In addition, we do not have exclusive relationships with our resellers and accordingly there is a risk that those resellers may give higher priority to products of other suppliers, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.
          We market and sell our storage solutions directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through channels such as value-added resellers, systems integrators, distributors, OEMs, and strategic business partners, and we derive a significant portion of our revenue from these indirect channel partners. In the nine-month period ended January 25, 2008, our indirect channels accounted for 62.5% of our consolidated revenues.
          In order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and maintain or increase our revenue, we must effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners. To do so, we must attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified channel partners to successfully market our products. However, because we also sell our products directly to customers through our sales force, on occasion we compete with our indirect channels for sales of our products to our end customers, competition that could result in conflicts with these indirect channel partners and make it harder for us to attract and retain these indirect channel partners. At the same time, our indirect channel partners may offer products that are competitive to ours. In addition, because our reseller partners generally offer products from several different companies, including products of our competitors, these resellers may give higher priority to the marketing, sales, and support of our competitors' products than ours. If we fail to effectively manage our relationships with these indirect channel partners to minimize channel conflict and continue to evaluate and meet our indirect sales partners' needs with respect to our products, we will not be able to maintain or increase our revenue, which would have a materially adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we do not manage distribution of our products and services and support effectively, or if our resellers' financial condition or operations weaken, our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected.
The U.S. government has contributed to our revenue growth and has become an important customer for us. Future revenue from the U.S. government is subject to shifts in government spending patterns. A decrease in government demand for our products, or an adverse outcome in an ongoing investigation by the GSA and the Department of Justice, could materially affect our growth and result in civil penalties and a loss of revenues.
          The U.S. government has become an important customer for the storage market and for us; however, government demand is unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that we will maintain or grow our revenue from the U.S. government. Government agencies are subject to budgetary processes and expenditure constraints that could lead to delays or decreased capital expenditures in IT spending. If the government or individual agencies within the government reduce or shift their capital spending pattern, our financial results may be harmed.
          Selling our products to the U.S. government also subjects us to certain regulatory requirements. We received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General for the General Services Administration ("GSA") seeking various records relating to GSA contracting activity by us during the period beginning in 1995 and ending in 2005. The subpoena is part of an investigation being conducted by GSA and the Department of Justice regarding potential violations of the False Claims Act in connection with our GSA contracting activity. The subpoena requested a range of documents including documents relating to our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its GSA contracts. We are cooperating with the investigation and have produced documents and met with the Department of Justice on several occasions. Violations of the False Claims Act could result in the imposition of a damage remedy which includes treble damages plus civil penalties, and could also result in us being suspended or debarred from future government contracting, any or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
 
The market price for our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future.
          The market price for our common stock has experienced substantial volatility in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to:
          In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Additionally, certain macroeconomic factors such as changes in interest rates, the market climate for the technology sector and levels of corporate spending on IT could also have an impact on the trading price of our stock. As a result, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and any broad market decline, as well as our own operating results, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
          Macroeconomic conditions and an IT spending slowdown as well as variations in our expected operating performance may continue to cause volatility in our stock price. We are unable to predict changes in general economic conditions and whether or to what extent global IT spending rates will be affected. Furthermore, if there are future reductions in either domestic or international IT spending rates, or if IT spending rates do not increase, our revenues, operating results, and stock price may continue to be adversely affected.
Our forecasts of our revenues and earnings outlook may be inaccurate and could materially and adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations.
          Our revenues are difficult to forecast. We use a "pipeline" system, a common industry practice, to forecast revenues and trends in our business. Sales personnel monitor the status of potential business and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision, the dollar amount of the sale and the products or services to be sold. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates may prove to be unreliable either in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time, in part because the "conversion rate" of the pipeline into contracts varies from customer to customer, can be difficult to estimate, and requires management judgment. Small deviations from our forecasted conversion rate may result in inaccurate plans and budgets and materially adversely impact our business or our planned results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in IT spending, weak general economic conditions or evolving technology can reduce the conversion rate in a particular quarter as our customers' purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amount, or cancelled.
          In addition, we apply the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2 and related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and software, because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware. This requires extensive analysis, even after contracts have been executed, before the timing of revenue recognition can be reliably determined due to both the complexity of the accounting rules regarding revenue recognition and the effect that multiple
 
element arrangements and other terms and conditions can have when these rules are applied. If we are unable to establish fair value for undelivered elements of a customer order, revenue relating to the entire order may be deferred until the revenue recognition criteria for all elements of the customer order are met. This could lower our net revenue in one period and increase it in future periods, resulting in greater variability in net revenue and income both on a period to period basis and on an actual versus forecast basis.
If we are unable to successfully implement our global brand awareness campaign, we may not be able to increase our customer base, market share, or revenue, and our operating results will be adversely affected.
          We believe that building our global brand awareness is a key factor to the long term success of our business and will be crucial in order for us to grow our customer base, increase our market share, and accelerate our revenue growth. In order to increase this awareness, we launched a new branding campaign in March 2008, which includes a new company name, logo, tagline and new corporate messaging. We are also increasing our sales headcount in order to leverage our brand awareness campaign and build demand for our products with both new and existing customers. We are currently incurring, and will continue to incur, significant expenses as a result of these investments. If we are not successful in achieving our desired growth in revenue, customers, demand and market share, whether on the time line we have forecasted or at all, our operating results will be adversely affected.
If we are unable to develop and introduce new products and respond to technological change, if our new products do not achieve market acceptance, if we fail to manage the transition between our new and old products, or if we cannot provide the expected level of service and support for our new products, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
          Our future growth depends upon the successful development and introduction of new hardware and software products. Due to the complexity of storage subsystems and storage security appliances and the difficulty in gauging the engineering effort required to produce new products, such products are subject to significant technical risks. In addition, our new products must respond to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements, or if such products do not achieve market acceptance, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, new or additional product introductions may also adversely affect our sales of existing products, which could also materially and adversely affect our operating results.
          As new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers' ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories, and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customers' demands.
          As we enter new or emerging markets, we will likely increase demands on our service and support operations and may be exposed to additional competition. We may not be able to provide products, service and support to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Furthermore, provision of greater levels of services may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition due to the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2 and related interpretations.
Our gross margins may vary based on the configuration of our product and service solutions, and such variation may make it more difficult to forecast our earnings.
          We derive a significant portion of our sales from the resale of disk drives as components of our storage systems, and the resale market for hard disk drives is highly competitive and subject to intense pricing pressures. Our sales of disk drives generate lower gross margin than those of our storage systems. As a result, as we sell more highly configured systems with greater disk drive content, overall gross margin may be negatively affected. Our product gross margins have been and may continue to be affected by a variety of other factors, including:
 
Changes in service gross margins may result from various factors such as:
An increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
          The storage markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology. In the storage market, our primary and nearline storage system products and our associated storage software portfolio compete primarily with storage system products and data management software from EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, HP, IBM, and Sun Microsystems. We also see Dell, Inc. as a competitor in the storage marketplace, primarily through its business partnership with EMC, which allows Dell to resell EMC storage hardware and software products. We have also historically encountered less-frequent competition from other companies, including LSI Logic. In the secondary storage market, which includes the disk-to-disk backup, compliance, and business continuity segments, our solutions compete primarily against products from EMC and Sun Microsystems. Our NearStore VTL appliances also compete with traditional tape backup solutions in the broader data backup/recovery space. Additionally, a number of small, new companies are currently attempting to enter the storage systems and data management software markets and the near-line and NearStore VTL storage markets, some of which may become significant competitors in the future.
          There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Competitive pressures we face could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption or termination of our supply arrangements could delay shipment of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
          We rely on a limited number of suppliers for components such as disk drives, computer boards and microprocessors utilized in the assembly of our products. In recent years, rapid industry consolidation has led to fewer component suppliers, which could subject us to periodic supply constraints and price rigidity. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks, including:
 
          Component quality risk is particularly significant with respect to our suppliers of disk drives. In order to meet product performance requirements, we must obtain disk drives of extremely high quality and capacity. In addition, there are periodic supply-and-demand issues for disk drives, microprocessors, and semiconductor memory components, which could result in component shortages, selective supply allocations, and increased prices of such components. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain our full requirements of such components in the future or that prices of such components will not increase. In addition, problems with respect to yield and quality of such components and timeliness of deliveries could occur. Disruption or termination of the supply of these components could delay shipments of our products and could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Such delays could also damage relationships with current and prospective customers and suppliers.
          In addition, we license certain technology and software from third parties that are incorporated into our products. If we are unable to obtain or license the technology and software on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we will not be able to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner.
The loss of any contract manufacturers or the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products or successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products.
          We currently rely on several contract manufacturers to manufacture our products in multiple locations around the world. Our reliance on our third-party contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance, production costs, and product supply. If we should fail to effectively manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers, or if our contract manufacturers experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations, our ability to ship products to our customers could be impaired, and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming. If we are required to change contract manufacturers or bring certain manufacturing in-house, we may lose revenue and damage our customer relationships. If we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may have excess or inadequate inventory or incur cancellation charges or penalties, which could adversely impact our operating results. As of January 25, 2008, we had no purchase commitments under our agreements with our contract manufacturers.
          We intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements, which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating with our contract manufacturers and suppliers. We may need to increase our material purchases, contract manufacturing capacity, and quality functions to meet anticipated demand. The inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products or their inability to obtain raw materials suitable for our needs could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders.
Our future financial performance depends on growth in the storage and data management markets. If these markets do not continue to grow at the rates we expect and upon which we calculate and forecast our growth, our operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.
          All of our products address the storage and data management markets. Accordingly, our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the storage and data management markets and on our ability to adapt to emerging standards in these markets. We cannot assure you that the markets for storage and data management will continue to grow or that emerging standards in these markets will not adversely affect the growth of UNIX, Windows and the World Wide Web server markets upon which we depend.
 
          For example, we provide our open access data retention solutions to customers within the financial services, healthcare, pharmaceutical and government market segments, industries that are subject to various evolving governmental regulations with respect to data access, reliability, and permanence (such as Rule 17(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate. If our products do not meet and continue to comply with these evolving governmental regulations in this regard, customers in these market and geographical segments will not purchase our products, and we will not be able to expand our product offerings in these market and geographical segments at the rates for which we have forecast.
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our financial results.
          At January 25, 2008 and April 27, 2007, we had $1,506.0 million and $1,430.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash and investments. We invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, consisting principally of investments in corporate bonds, auction rate securities, money market funds and corporate securities, municipalities and the United States government and its agencies. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events such as the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States which has affected various sectors of the financial markets and led to global credit and liquidity issues. If the global credit market continues to deteriorate, our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring an impairment charge which could adversely impact our financial results.
          We account for our investment instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, ("SFAS No. 115"), . All of the cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted investments are treated as "available-for-sale" under SFASNo. 115. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Because we have the ability and intent to hold our available-for sale investments until maturity, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity. However, we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have experienced a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use financial derivatives to hedge our interest rate exposure.
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
Funds associated with certain of our auction rate securities may not be accessible for in excess of 12 months and our auction rate securities may experience an other than temporary decline in value, which would adversely affect our earnings.
          Auction rate securities or, ARS, held by us are securities with long term nominal maturities which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at time of purchase. Interest rates for ARS are reset through a "Dutch auction" each month, which historically has provided a liquid market for these securities.
          Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education, and we believe the credit quality of these securities is high based on this guarantee. However liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in the failure of auctions for certain of our ARS investments, with a par value of $76.1 million at April 25, 2008. For each failed auction, the interest rate moves to a maximum rate defined for each security, and the ARS continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms, although the principal associated with the ARS will not be accessible until there is a successful auction or such time as other markets for ARS investments develop.
          We believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our ARS investments have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded a temporary impairment within other accumulated comprehensive income, an element of stockholders' equity on our balance sheet, of approximately $3.5 million at April 25, 2008. In addition, we have classified substantially all of our auction rate securities that were not liquidated before April 25, 2008 as long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of April 25, 2008 as our ability to liquidate such securities in the next 12 months is
 
uncertain. If liquidity issues in the global credit market continue, or worsen, or if we experience reduced credit quality, extended illiquidity or realize reduced valuations of our ARS investments, we may determine that we have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value in these long-term assets, which could adversely impact our earnings.
Our synthetic leases are off-balance sheet arrangements that could negatively affect our financial condition and results. We are investing substantial resources in new facilities and physical infrastructure, which will increase our fixed costs. Our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately to our increase in fixed costs.
          We have various synthetic lease arrangements with BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (the lessor) for our headquarters office buildings in Sunnyvale, California and a datacenter in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. These synthetic leases qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases (as amended), and are not considered variable interest entities under FIN No. 46R, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised)". Therefore, we do not include the properties or the associated debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. However, if circumstances were to change regarding ours or BNP's ownership of the properties, or in BNP's overall portfolio we could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facilities and the associated debt.
          If we elect not to purchase the properties at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a minimum residual value to BNP. Therefore, if the fair value of the properties declines below that guaranteed minimum residual value, our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to BNP, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
          We have contractual commitments related to capital expenditures on construction or expansion of our facilities and data center. We may encounter cost overruns or project delays in connection with new facilities. These expansions will increase our fixed costs. If we are unable to grow our business and revenues proportionately to our increase in fixed costs, our profitability will be reduced.
Unfavorable economic and market conditions and global disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.
          Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions as well as the uncertain geopolitical environment. Customer demand for our products is intrinsically linked to the strength of the economy. A reduction in demand for storage and data management caused by weakening economic conditions and customer decreases in corporate spending, deferral or delay of IT projects, longer time frames for IT purchasing decisions and generally reduced capital expenditures for IT storage solutions will result in decreased revenues and lower revenue growth rates for us. The network storage market growth declined significantly beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, causing both our revenues and operating results to decline. If the storage and data management markets grow more slowly than anticipated, or if emerging standards other than those adopted by us become increasingly accepted by these markets, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
          Turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, including terrorist activities and military actions, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. We have no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations in either the U.S. or other regions of the world. Continued increases in energy prices, declining economic conditions and global credit and liquidity issues could also affect our future operating results. If the economic and market conditions in the United States and globally do not improve, or if they deteriorate, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Risks inherent in our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
          We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside of the U.S. For example, for the nine-month period ended January 25, 2008, 44.8% of our total revenues were from international customers (including U.S. exports). In addition, we have several research and development centers overseas, and a substantial portion of our products are manufactured outside of the U.S. Accordingly, our business and our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by a variety of factors affecting our international operations, some of which are beyond our control, including regulatory, political, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements,
 
government spending patterns, and acts of terrorism and international conflicts. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products.
          We face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our international sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and in foreign currencies. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore potentially less competitive in foreign markets. Conversely, lowering our price in local currency may result in lower U.S.-based revenue. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of local operating expenses. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility.We utilize forward and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure associated with certain assets and liabilities as well as anticipated foreign currency cash flows. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every quarter. The time-value component of our cash flow hedges is recorded in earnings while all other gains and losses are marked to market through other comprehensive income until forecasted transactions occur, at which time such realized gains and losses are recognized in earnings. These hedges attempt to reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. Factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets as well as widening interest rate differentials and the volatility of the foreign exchange market. There can be no assurance that such hedging strategies will be successful and that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
          Additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include, among others, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in managing international operations. Such factors could materially and adversely affect our future international sales and consequently our operating results. Our international operations are subject to other risks, including general import/export restrictions and the potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights than U.S. law.
A significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents balances is held overseas. If we are not able to generate sufficient earnings cash domestically in order to fund our U.S. operations and strategic opportunities and service our debt, we may incur a significant tax liability in order to repatriate the overseas cash balances, or we may need to raise additional capital in the future.
          A portion of our earnings which is generated from our international operations is held and invested by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. These amounts are not freely available for dividend repatriation to the United States without triggering significant adverse tax consequences, which could adversely affect our operating results. As a result, unless the cash generated by our domestic operations is sufficient to fund our domestic operations, our broader corporate initiatives such as stock repurchases, acquisitions, and other strategic opportunities, and to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings, or we may need to expand our existing credit facilities to the extent we choose not to repatriate our overseas cash. Such additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and any new equity financings or offerings would dilute our current stockholders' ownership. Furthermore, lenders, in particular in light of the current challenges in the credit markets, may not agree to extend us new, additional or continuing credit. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to repatriate our foreign cash and incur a significant tax expense or we may not be able to take advantage of strategic opportunities, develop new products, respond to competitive pressures or repay our outstanding indebtedness. In any such case, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.
          Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:
 
          We receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non-U.S. customers. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the United States and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits. Our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the Netherlands, which expires in 2010. If we are unable to renegotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling, our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole.
          The price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate. We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our intellectual property ("IP") are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations, which has resulted in material proposed assessments and/or pending litigation. Our management does not believe, based upon information currently known to us, that the final resolution of any of our audits will have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position and our results of operations and cash flows. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.
We may face increased risks and uncertainties related to our current or future acquisitions and investments in nonmarketable securities of private companies, and these investments may not achieve our objectives.
          As part of our strategy, we are continuously evaluating opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products, expand the breadth of our markets, or enhance our technical capabilities. We may engage in future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders' investments and cause us to use cash, incur debt, or assume contingent liabilities.
          Acquisitions of companies entail numerous risks, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize anticipated synergies, economies of scale, or other value. Integration risks and
 
issues may include, but are not limited to, key personnel retention and assimilation, management distraction, technical development, and unexpected costs and liabilities, including goodwill impairment charges. In addition, we may be unable to recover strategic investments in development stage entities. Any such problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
          On occasion, we invest in nonmarketable securities of private companies. As of January 25, 2008, the carrying value of our investments in nonmarketable securities totaled $11.2 million. Investments in nonmarketable securities are inherently risky, and some of these companies are likely to fail. Their success (or lack thereof) is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business success factors. In addition, depending on these companies' future prospects, they may not be able to raise additional funds when needed, or they may receive lower valuations, with less favorable investment terms than in previous financings, and our investments in them would likely become impaired.
If we fail to manage our expanding business effectively, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.
          Our future operating results depend to a large extent on management's ability to successfully manage expansion and growth, including but not limited to expanding international operations, forecasting revenues, addressing new markets, controlling expenses, implementing and enhancing infrastructure, investing in people, facilities and capital equipment, and managing our assets. An unexpected decline in the growth rate of revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expense growth or a failure to manage other aspects of growth could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
          In addition, continued expansion could strain our current management, financial, manufacturing, and other existing systems and may require us to improve those existing systems or implement new ones. If we experience any problems with the improvement or expansion of these systems, procedures, or controls, or if these systems, procedures, or controls are not designed, implemented, or improved in a cost-effective and timely manner, our operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any failure to implement, improve, and expand such systems, procedures, and controls in a timely and efficient manner could harm our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to achieve our business objectives.
As we continue to grow our business, we are likely to incur costs earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, which could harm our operating results. A significant percentage of our expenses are fixed, which could materially and adversely affect our net income.
          We are increasing our investment in engineering, sales, service support, and other functions to grow our business. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could harm our business.
          Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future sales, and a significant percentage of our expenses are fixed. As a result, if sales levels are below expectations or previously higher levels, net income will be disproportionately affected in a material and adverse manner.
We depend on the ability of our personnel, raw materials, equipment, and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world. Our business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of a natural disaster, terrorist acts, or other catastrophic events.
          Any political, military, world health, or other issue that hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions. Furthermore, any strike, economic failure, or other material disruption caused by fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, power shortages, telecommunications failures, break-ins, and similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology, or directly impact our marketing, manufacturing, financial, and logistics functions, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our headquarters are located in Northern
 
California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. If any significant disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.
We depend on attracting and retaining qualified technical and sales personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain such personnel, our operating results could be materially and adversely impacted.
          Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified technical and sales personnel. Because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, background, and industry experience. Competition for qualified engineers, particularly in Silicon Valley, can be intense. The loss of the services of a significant number of our engineers or salespeople could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
Undetected software errors, hardware errors, or failures found in new products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.
          Our products may contain undetected software errors, hardware errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. Despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may not be found in new products until after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
          If we fail to remedy a product defect, we may experience a failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.
          In addition, we may be subject to losses that may result or are alleged to result from defects in our products, which could subject us to claims for damages, including consequential damages. Based on our historical experience, we believe that the risk of exposure to product liability claims is currently low. However, should we experience increased exposure to product liability claims, our business could be adversely impacted.
We are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our operating results.
          We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business, including our ongoing litigation with Sun Microsystems. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.
          If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may be subject to increased competition that could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our success depends significantly upon our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret, copyright, and patent laws, which afford only limited protection. Some of our U.S. trademarks are registered internationally as well. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks as appropriate. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and with our resellers, strategic partners and customers. We currently have multiple U.S. and international patent applications pending and multiple U.S. patents issued. The pending applications may not be approved, and our existing and future patents may be challenged. If such challenges are brought, the patents may be invalidated. We cannot assure you that we will develop proprietary products or technologies that are patentable, that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will not materially and adversely affect our ability to do business. In addition, a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position.
 
          Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary technology. Any such litigation may be time consuming and costly. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property rights of ours.
          We are subject to intellectual property infringement claims. We may, from time to time, receive claims that we are infringing third parties' intellectual property rights. Third parties may in the future claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products, patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights. We expect that companies in the network storage market will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such claims could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays, require us to redesign our products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure, accounting, and tax requirements that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.
          Because our common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state, and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, and NASDAQ, have implemented requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by Congress, most notably the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
          We completed our evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended April 27, 2007 as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Although our assessment, testing, and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of April 27, 2007, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective, we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods. If our internal controls are ineffective in future periods, our business and reputation could be harmed. We may incur additional expenses and commitment of management's time in connection with further evaluations, either of which could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income.
          Because new and modified laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices.
Our ability to forecast earnings is limited by the impact of new and existing accounting requirements such as SFAS No. 123R.
          The Financial Accounting Standards Board requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock options and other share-based payment compensation to employees as compensation expense in the statement of income. Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected life, and forfeiture rate. We have chosen to base our estimate of future volatility using the implied volatility of traded options to purchase our common stock as permitted by SAB No. 107. As of April 29, 2006, the contractual life of our stock options was shortened to seven years from ten years for options issued on or after this date, and to the extent that the shorter life changes employees' exercise behavior, it may change the expected term of an option going forward. SFAS No. 123R requires us to use estimated forfeitures, and therefore the adoption of SFAS No. 123R could have a material impact on the timing of and, based on the accuracy of estimates of future actual forfeitures, the amount of stock-based compensation expense. Given the unpredictable nature of the "Black Scholes" variables and other management assumptions such as number of options to be granted, underlying strike price, and associated income tax impacts, it is
 
very difficult to forecast stock-based compensation expense for any given quarter or year. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact our ability to make accurate forecasts of future earnings and volatility of our stock price. If another party asserts that the fair value of our employee stock options is misstated, securities class action litigation could be brought against us, or the market price of our common stock could decline, or both could occur. As a result, we could incur significant losses, and our operating results may be adversely affected.

Exhibit 99.5
This message is NetApp Confidential and intended to be read only by employees of NetApp, Inc. Please do not forward this message to anyone.
At the close of the market today, NetApp issued a press release announcing our intention to raise approximately $1B in cash. I am sure many of you are asking why we would do that if we have more than $1B in cash on hand today. The answer is that most of our cash resides outside the U.S., while most of our cash needs are inside the U.S. If we transferred our non-U.S. cash into the U.S., we would incur a significant U.S. tax expense. We believe that the most effective way to increase the amount of cash available to us in the U.S. is to offer a corporate debt instrument called a convertible note.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of NetApp common stock into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. The notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.

Company
Notes
Initial Purchasers
Indenture
The Notes are governed by an Indenture, dated as of June 10, 2008 (the ""), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and will bear interest at a rate of 1.75% per year payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2008. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Notes are convertible into cash and shares of the Company's common stock (""), if any, at an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment. Prior to March 1, 2013, such conversion is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth below. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the Indenture).
Indenture
Common Stock
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes on or after March 1, 2013 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. Upon conversion, the Company will satisfy its conversion obligation by delivering cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, based on a daily settlement amount (as defined in the Indenture). Prior to March 1, 2013, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes, under any of the following conditions:
A copy of the Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions of the Notes contained in this Form 8-K are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Indenture.
Registration Rights Agreement
The Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2008 (the ""), with Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as representatives of the Initial Purchasers (the ""). Under the Registration Agreement, the Company has agreed to use its reasonable efforts to cause a shelf registration statement relating to the resale of the Notes and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes to be declared effective no later than the 181 calendar day after the later of the original date of issuance of the Notes or the date of issuance of additional Notes following the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase additional Notes. The Company will be required to pay additional interest if the registration statement has not become effective by such date. The Company's obligation to have declared effective or maintain an effective registration statement will be suspended to the extent that the Notes and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes are eligible to be sold by a person who is not an affiliate of the Company pursuant to Rule

144 without any volume or manner of sale restrictions. Additional interest will be the sole remedy for damages under the Registration Agreement. A copy of the Registration Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Convertible Note Hedge Transactions:
On June 4, 2008, in connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its Common Stock (the "") with each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, BNP Paribas and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (collectively, the ""). The Company paid an aggregate amount of $254.9 million to the Counterparties for the Purchased Options. The Purchased Options cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the Notes, approximately 39.7 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes, also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the Notes. The Purchased Options will expire upon the maturity of the Notes. A form of the confirmations relating to the Purchased Options is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Purchased Options
Counterparties
The Purchased Options are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the Notes, at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the Notes.
The Purchased Options are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Purchased Options.
Warrant Transactions
Separately, on June 4, 2008, the Company also entered into warrant transactions (the ""), amended on June 6, 2008 in connection with the Initial Purchasers' exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes, whereby the Company sold to the Counterparties warrants to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, up to 39.7 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price of $41.28 per share of Common Stock, also subject to adjustment, which is approximately 75% higher than the closing sale price of shares of Common Stock of $23.59 on June 4, 2008. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $163.06 million from the sale of the Warrants to the Counterparties. The Warrants will expire after the Purchased Options in approximately ratable portions on a series of expiration dates commencing on September 3, 2013. The Warrants were sold in private placements to the Counterparties pursuant to the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""), afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. A form of the confirmations relating to the Warrant transactions is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference. A form of the amendment to the Warrants is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Warrants
Securities Act
If the market value per share of the Common Stock, as measured under the Warrants, exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share. The Warrants will be accounted for as an adjustment to the Company's stockholders' equity.
The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants.
The foregoing terms and conditions of the Notes, Indenture and Registration Agreement described in Items 1.01 and 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K are incorporated herein by reference.
Table of Contents
As described in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, the Company issued $1,265,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes to the Initial Purchasers on June 10, 2008 in a private placement pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
The Company offered and sold the Notes to the Initial Purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers are initially offering the Notes to "qualified institutional buyers" pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions from registration based in part on representations made by the Initial Purchasers.
The Notes and Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
The Notes are convertible into cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, as described above.
On June 4, 2008, as amended on June 6, 2008 in connection with the Initial Purchasers' exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes, the Company agreed to sell Warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 39.7 million shares of Common Stock at a strike price of $41.28 per share of Common Stock, also subject to adjustment, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Act. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $163.06 million from the sale of the Warrants.
Neither the Warrants nor the underlying Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Warrants have been registered under the Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.
Additional information pertaining to the Warrants is contained in Item 1.01 and is incorporated herein by reference.
On June 5, 2008, the Company issued a press release with respect to the pricing of its offer and sale of the Notes. A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

     Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are erroneous.

The Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of all such instruments or instruments and records delivered to the Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 9.01) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
     (c) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders. If not set by the Company prior to the first solicitation of a Holder made by any Person in respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided pursuant to Section 10.01) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case may be. With regard to any record date, only the Holders on such date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or take, or vote on, the relevant action.
 
     (d) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
     (e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.
     Section 1.05

     Section 1.06
. Notice to Holders; Waiver.
     Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, or by such other means reasonably acceptable to the Holder, in each case not later than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
 
     In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

     In any case where the due date for the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security or the last day on which a Holder of a Security has a right to convert his Security shall be, at any Place of Payment or Place of Conversion, as the case may be, a day on which banking institutions at such Place of Payment or Place of Conversion are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close, then payment of principal, interest or delivery for conversion of such Security need not be made on or by such date at such place but may be made on or by the next succeeding day at such place which is not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close, with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date fixed for redemption or repurchase, or by such last day for conversion, and no interest shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period after such date.
     Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the Holder has the right, at such Holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase all of such Holder's Securities or any portion thereof (in principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) on the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities such Holder elects to require the Company to repurchase, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. The Company or, at the written request of the Company, the Trustee shall mail to all Holders of record of the Securities a notice of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right arising as a result thereof after the occurrence of any Fundamental Change, but on or before the 10 calendar day following such occurrence.

integral multiple thereof), at the principal amount hereof, or of such portion, into cash and fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock of the Company, if any, at the Conversion Rate specified in the Indenture, by surrender of this Security together with a Notice of Conversion, a form of which is set forth in Section 2.05, as provided in the Indenture and this note, duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, to the Company at its office or agency, which shall be initially the corporate trust operations office of U.S. Bank National Association in St. Paul, Minnesota, and, unless the cash and shares of Common Stock, if any, deliverable on conversion are to be issued in the same name as this note, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or its agent duly executed by, the Holder or by his duly authorized attorney, or if less than the entire principal amount hereof is to be converted, the portion hereof to be converted, and, in case such surrender shall be made during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date, also accompanied by payment in dollars of an amount equal to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of this Security then being converted. Subject to the aforesaid requirement for payment and, in the case of a conversion after the Regular Record Date next preceding any Interest Payment Date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, to the right of the Holder of this Security (or any Predecessor Security) of record at such Regular Record Date to receive an installment of interest (with certain exceptions provided in the Indenture), no payment or adjustment is to be made on conversion for interest accrued hereon or for dividends on the Common Stock issued on conversion.

In addition, the Indenture provides that in case of certain consolidations or mergers to which the Company is a party or the transfer of substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Indenture shall be amended, without the consent of any Holders of Securities, so that this Security, if then outstanding, will be convertible thereafter, during the period this Security shall be convertible as specified above, by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities and other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive.
     No sinking fund is provided for the Securities and the Securities are not subject to redemption at the option of the Company.
     In the event of conversion of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities for the unconverted portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed or to convert this Security as provided in the Indenture.

     where,
For purposes of this subsection (b), in determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less
 
than such Last Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate exercise or offering price payable for such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors. If any such rights or warrants are not exercised or converted prior to the expiration of the exercisability or convertibility thereof, the new Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if such right or warrant had not been issued.
     (c) If the Company distributes shares of Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding:
     (i) dividends or distributions referred to in clause (a) or (b) above or (e) below;

where,
     Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on the Ex-Date for such dividend or distribution. If any such dividend or distribution is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
     (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:

Such adjustment to the Conversion Rate shall occur at the close of business on the tenth Trading Day from, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; that in respect of any conversion within 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this subsection (e) to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the expiration date of such tender or exchange offer and the Conversion Date in determining the applicable Conversion Rate. If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Date that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.

     (f) In the event of an increase in the Conversion Rate pursuant to clauses (b) through (e) of this Section 6.02 or Section 6.03, that would result in the Securities, in the aggregate, becoming convertible into shares of Common Stock in excess of limitation set forth in NASDAQ Rule 4350, or a successor to such rule, as may then be in effect and interpreted by NASDAQ, the Company shall, at its option, either obtain stockholder approval of such issuances or deliver cash in lieu of any shares otherwise deliverable upon conversions in excess of such limitations (based on the Daily VWAP on the last VWAP Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period).
     (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.02, (i) no adjustment shall be made thereunder, nor shall an adjustment be made to the ability of a Holder to convert, for any distribution described therein if the Holder will otherwise participate in such distribution as a result of holding their Securities and at the same time as holders of the Common Stock participate, without conversion of such Holder's Securities as if such Holders held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to (x) the applicable Conversion Rate multiplied by the principal amount of Securities held by such Holders (y) divided
 
by one thousand and (ii) no adjustment shall be made hereunder if the application of the foregoing formulas would result in a decline in the Conversion Rate (other than as a result of a share split or share combination pursuant to Section 6.02(a)), unless such application is a result of a readjustment to the Conversion Rate specifically contemplated by this Indenture.
     (h) In addition to any increases to the Conversion Rate required by subsections(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Section 6.02, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Stock Market or any other securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 calendar days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Security at his last address appearing on the register provided for in Section 10.01 and the Trustee a notice of the increase at least 15 calendar days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. In addition, the Company may also (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event.
     (i) Except as set forth in this Section 6.02 or Section 6.03, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made. Without limiting the foregoing, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted:
     (i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
     (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase or acquire such shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
     (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) above and outstanding prior to the Issue Date;
     (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
     (v) for accrued and unpaid interest.
 
     (j) All calculations under this Section 6.02 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be.
     (k) For purposes of this Section 6.02, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. If the Company pays any dividend or makes any distribution on, or issues any rights, options or warrants in respect of, shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company, the Company shall not issue, transfer or convey such shares of Common Stock in a manner that would have the effect of circumventing the provisions of this Section 6.02.
     (l) Whenever any provision of this Article 6 requires a calculation of the Last Reported Sale Prices or Daily VWAP over a span of multiple days, the Company will make appropriate adjustments (determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) to account for any adjustment or multiple simultaneous adjustments to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which such prices are to be calculated.
     (m) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be required unless the adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Conversion Rate. However, the Company will carry forward any adjustments that are less than 1% of the Conversion Rate that the Company elects not to make and take them into account upon the earlier of (i) any conversion of Securities and (ii) such time as all adjustments that have not been made prior thereto would have the effect of adjusting the Conversion Rate by at least 1%.
     Section 6.03
. Adjustment Upon Fundamental Changes.
     (a) If a Fundamental Change occurs, the Company shall notify each of the Holders and the Trustee of the occurrence of any such event or transaction on the Effective Date of such Fundamental Change.
     (b) If a Holder elects to convert Securities in connection with a Fundamental Change (after giving effect to any exception or exclusion in such definition) that occurs prior to the Maturity Date, the Conversion Rate applicable to each $1,000 principal amount of Securities so converted shall be increased by an additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "") as described below. A conversion shall be deemed to be in connection with a Fundamental Change if such conversion occurs on or after the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change and prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the related Fundamental Change Repurchase Date. The Company shall notify the Holders and the Trustee of the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change on the Effective Date of such transaction.
Additional Shares
 
     (i) The number of Additional Shares by which the Conversion Rate will be increased shall be determined by the Company by reference to the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the earliest of date on which the Fundamental Change is publicly announced, occurs or becomes effective (the "") and the Stock Price; that if the actual Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Reference Date is between two Make-Whole Reference Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the next higher and next lower Stock Price amounts and the two nearest Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; that if (A) the Stock Price is greater than $150.00 per share of Common Stock (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 6.02), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate, and (B) the Stock Price is less than $23.59 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 6.02), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Rate exceed 42.3908 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Securities (subject to adjustment in the same manner as set forth in Section 6.02).
Make-Whole Reference Date
provided
provided further
     (ii) The Stock Prices set forth in the first column of the table in Schedule A hereto (, the row headers) shall be adjusted by the Company as of any date on which the Conversion Rate of the Securities is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the applicable Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Additional Shares within the table shall be adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 6.02.
i.e.
     (c) Settlement of Securities tendered for conversion as to which the Conversion Rate will be increased by Additional Shares pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall occur on the third Business Day immediately following the later of (i) last day of the Observation Period for such Security or (ii) the date the Stock Price relating to the relevant Make-Whole Reference Date becomes known.
     (d) For the avoidance of doubt, if a Holder converts Securities prior to the Effective Date of a Fundamental Change, and the Fundamental Change does not occur, the Holder shall not be entitled to Additional Shares in connection with such conversion.
     Section 6.04
. Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Rate.
 
     Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided:
     (a) the Company shall compute the adjusted Conversion Rate in accordance with Section 6.02 and shall prepare a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and showing in reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based, and such certificate shall promptly be filed with the Trustee and with each Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee); and
     (b) upon each such adjustment, a notice stating that the Conversion Rate has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate shall be required, such notice shall be provided by the Company to all Holders in accordance with Section 1.06.
     Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such certificate or the information and calculations contained therein, except to exhibit the same to any Holder of Securities desiring inspection thereof at its office during normal business hours.
     Section 6.05
. Company to Reserve Common Stock.
     The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Securities, the full number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Securities.
     Section 6.06
. Taxes on Conversions.
     Except as provided in the next sentence, the Company shall pay all documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in respect of (i) income of the Holder, or (ii) any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the amount of any such tax or duty, or has established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax or duty has been paid.
     Section 6.07
. Certain Covenants.
     Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Rate below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities, the Company shall take all corporate action which it reasonably determines may be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.
 
     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of Securities shall be fully paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.
     The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed for trading on any other national securities exchange the Company shall, if permitted and required by the rules of such exchange, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities.
     Section 6.08
. Cancellation of Converted Securities.
     All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, repurchase, conversion or registration of transfer, shall, if surrendered to the Company or any Paying Agent or any Security Registrar, be surrendered to the Trustee and promptly canceled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be promptly canceled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee shall dispose of canceled Securities in accordance with its customary procedures and shall promptly provide copies of all cancelled certificates to the Company. If the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as satisfaction of the debt represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
     Section 6.09
. Provision in Case of Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale.
     In the event of (i) any Fundamental Change described in clause (2) of the definition of Fundamental Change, (ii) any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a split, subdivision or combination), (iii) any consolidation, binding share exchange, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, combination or other similar event of the Company with another Person or (iv) any sale, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company to any other Person, in each case as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock (any such event described in clauses (i) through (iv) a ""), then:
Merger Event
     (a) the Company or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) permitted under Section 12.01(d) providing for the conversion and settlement of the Securities as set forth in this Indenture. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may
 
be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article and the Trustee may conclusively rely on the determination by the Company of the equivalency of such adjustments. If, in the case of any Merger Event, the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a company other than the successor or purchasing company, as the case may be, in such change of control, consolidation, binding share exchange, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, combination, sale, transfer or conveyance or Fundamental Change described in clause (2) of the definition of Fundamental Change, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other company and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing.
     In the event a supplemental indenture is executed pursuant to this Section 6.09, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefore, the kind or amount of cash, securities or property or assets that will constitute the Reference Property after any such Merger Event, any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and that all conditions precedent have been complied with, and shall promptly mail notice thereof to all Holders.
     If any securities to be provided for the purpose of conversion of Securities hereunder require registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal or state law before such securities may be validly issued upon conversion, each supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Section shall provide that the Company or the successor or the purchasing Person, as the case may be, or if the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities and assets of a company other than the successor or purchasing company, as the case may be, then such company, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the SEC (or any successor thereto), to secure such registration or approval in connection with the conversion of Securities.
     (b) Notwithstanding, and subject to the provisions of Section 6.01, at the effective time of such Merger Event, the right to convert each $1,000 principal amount of Securities shall be changed to a right to convert such Securities by reference to the kind and amount of cash, securities or other property or assets that a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate immediately prior to such transaction would have owned or been entitled to receive (the ""). For purposes of determining the constitution of Reference Property, the type and amount of consideration that a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled to in the case of consolidations, binding share exchanges, recapitalizations, reclassifications, mergers, combinations, sales or transfers of assets or Fundamental Changes described in clause (2) of the definition of Fundamental Change or other transactions that cause the Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive more than a single type of consideration (determined, based in part upon any form of stockholder election) shall be deemed to be the (i) weighted average of the types and amounts of
Reference Property
 
consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make such an election or (ii) if no holders of Common Stock affirmatively make such election, the types and amounts of consideration actually received by such holders. None of the foregoing provisions shall affect any right of a Holder of Securities to convert its Securities in accordance with the provisions of this Article prior to the effective date.
     (c) Following the effective time of any such Merger Event, settlement of Securities converted shall be in cash and units of Reference Property determined in accordance with Section 6.01(c) above based on the Daily Conversion Value and Daily VWAP of such Reference Property. For the purposes of determining such Daily Conversion Value and Daily VWAP, (i) if the Reference Property includes securities for which the price can be determined in a manner contemplated by the definition of Daily VWAP, then the value of such securities shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in such definition, as determined in good faith by the Company (which determination shall be conclusive and binding); (ii) if the Reference Property includes other property (other than securities as to which clause (i) applies or cash), then the value of such property shall be the Fair Market Value of such property as determined by the Company's Board of Directors in good faith; and (iii) if the Reference Property includes cash, then the value of such cash shall be the amount thereof.
     (d) The Company shall cause notice of the execution of a supplemental indenture required by this Section 6.09 to be mailed to each Holder, at his address appearing on the register provided for in Section 10.01, or by such other means reasonably acceptable to such Holder, within 20 calendar days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.
     (e) The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to successive Merger Events.
     Section 6.10
. Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions.
     The Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed, herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same, or whether a supplemental indenture need be entered into. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common Stock, or of any other securities or property or cash, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Securities; and it or they do not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make or
 
calculate any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or share certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the surrender of any Security for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.
     Section 6.11To the extent that the Company has a rights plan in effect upon conversion of the Securities into Common Stock, the Holder will receive, in addition to the Common Stock, the rights under the rights plan, unless prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, in which case, and only in such case, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Company distributed to all holders of Common Stock shares of the Company's Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in Section 6.02(c) above, subject to readjustment in the event of the expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may amend such applicable stockholder rights agreement to provide that upon conversion of the Securities the Holders will receive, in addition to the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the rights which would have attached to such Common Stock if the rights had not become separated from the Common Stock under such applicable stockholder rights agreement. Any distribution of rights or warrants pursuant to a rights plan that would allow a Holder to receive upon conversion, in addition to shares of Common Stock, the rights described therein with respect to such Common Stock (unless such rights or warrants have separated from the Common Stock) shall not constitute a distribution of rights or warrants that would entitle the Holder to an adjustment to the Conversion Rate.
. Stockholder Rights Plan.
     Section 6.12
. Right to Set-off Withholding Taxes.
     The Company may, at its option, set-off withholding taxes due with respect to Securities as a result of an adjustment to the Conversion Rate against payments of cash and shares on the Securities.
     Section 7.01
. Events of Default.
     "", wherever used herein, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):
Event of Default
 
     (a) default in the payment of any interest (including Additional Interest) upon any Security when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; or
     (b) default in the payment of the principal of any Security when due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon required repurchase, upon acceleration or otherwise; or
     (c) failure by the Company to comply with its obligation to convert the Securities into cash and, if applicable, shares of Common Stock or Reference Property (as defined in Section 12.11(b) of this Indenture) upon exercise of a Holder's conversion right; or;
     (d) failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Article 8; or
     (e) failure by the Company to issue a Fundamental Change Repurchase Right Notice in accordance with Section 5.01; or
     (f) failure by the Company for 60 days after written notice from the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% principal amount of the Outstanding Securities has been received by the Company to comply with any of its other agreements contained in the Securities or this Indenture; or
     (g) default by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company with respect to any debt for money borrowed in excess of $50,000,000 in the aggregate of the Company and/or any Significant Subsidiary of the Company, whether such debt now exists or shall hereafter be created, which default shall have resulted (i) in such debt in an amount exceeding $50,000,000 being accelerated and not rescinded or (ii) from a failure to pay the principal of any such debt in an amount exceeding $50,000,000 when due and payable at its Stated Maturity (and including any grace period relating to such debt), upon required repurchase or declaration; or
     (h) the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries shall commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to itself or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its respective property, or shall consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its debts as they become due; or
     (i) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries seeking liquidation,
 
reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any substantial part of its respective property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed for a period of sixty (60) consecutive calendar days.
     Section 7.02
. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
     (a) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then and in every such case except as provided below, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the principal of all the Securities to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal shall become immediately due and payable. However, upon an Event of Default arising out of Section 7.01(h) or Section 7.01(i) (except with respect to any Significant Subsidiary) the principal of all the Securities, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the acceleration date, shall be due and payable immediately without notice from the Trustee or Holders.
     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of the Company, the sole remedy with respect to an Event of Default for the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under Section 314(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act relating to the Company's failure to file any documents or reports that the Company is required to file with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or of its covenants set forth in Section 10.04 (any such Event of Default, a ""), shall for the first 180 calendar days after the occurrence of such Reporting Default consist exclusively of the right to receive additional interest (the "") on the Securities at an annual rate equal to (i) 0.25% of the principal amount of the Securities for the first 90 calendar days after the occurrence of such Reporting Default and (ii) 0.50% of the principal amount of the Securities from the 91 day to, and including, the 180 day after the occurrence of such Reporting Default. If the Company so elects, the Reporting Interest shall accrue on all Outstanding Securities from and including the date on which such Reporting Default first occurs until such violation is cured or waived and shall be payable as provided in Section 3.08. On the 181 day after such Reporting Default (if such violation is not cured or waived prior to such 181 calendar day), then the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all such Securities to be due and payable immediately. Subject to Section 4.08, the payment of Reporting Interest as described in this Section 7.02 shall also constitute the payment of Additional Interest during such period as it is paid in connection with any requirement to pay Additional Interest under the Registration Rights Agreement, and the payment of such Additional Interest shall likewise constitute the payment of Reporting Interest during such period as it is paid in connection with any election by the
Reporting Default

st
 
Company to pay Reporting Interest as the sole remedy for a Reporting Default as described in this paragraph.
     (c) If the Company elects to pay the Reporting Interest as the sole remedy for the Reporting Default, the Company shall notify in writing, by a certificate, the Holders, the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such election at any time on or before the close of business on the first Business Day following the date on which such Event of Default first occurs. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives at the Corporate Trust Office such a certificate, the Trustee may assume without inquiry that Reporting Interest is not payable. The Company shall pay the Reporting Interest semi-annually in arrears, with the first semi-annual payment due on the first Interest Payment Date following the date of such Reporting Default, in the same manner as described on the face of the Security.
     This Section 7.02, however, is subject to the conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Securities shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay installments of accrued and unpaid interest upon all Securities and the principal of any and all Securities that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of accrued and unpaid interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by the Securities during the period of such Default), and if (a) rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (b) any and all Events of Default under this Indenture with respect to such Securities, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Securities or failure to deliver amounts due upon conversion that shall have become due solely by such acceleration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 7.13, then and in every such case the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all Defaults or Events of Default with respect to the Securities and rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences and such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon. No rescission or annulment referred to above shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 7.03
. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
     The Company covenants that if
 
     (a) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or
     (b) default is made in the payment of the principal of any Security at the Maturity thereof, the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and interest, and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and on any overdue interest, at the rate borne by the Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.
     If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
     Section 7.04
. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
     In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 9.07.
     No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
 
     Section 7.05
. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
     Section 7.06
. Application of Money Collected.
     Subject to Article 6, any money or property money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

. Company May Consolidate, Etc., Only on Certain Terms.
     The Company shall not consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, unless:

     Section 9.01
. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
     The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section. No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, subject to Section 9.03.
 
     In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that (i) conflicts with law or this Indenture, (ii) that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or (iii) that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under this Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.
     Section 9.02
. Notice of Defaults.
     The Trustee shall give the Holders notice of any default known to the Trustee that has occurred and is continuing hereunder within 90 days after such default has occurred. Except in the case of the default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Security or conversion default, the Trustee need not deliver the notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of Holders. In addition, the Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities notice of any default actually known to it as and to the extent provided by the Trust Indenture Act. For the purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default.

     (d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and

     (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney; and

     The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent, any Security Registrar or any other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and, subject to Section 9.08 and Section 9.13, may otherwise deal with the Company with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.
     Section 9.06
. Money Held in Trust.
     Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.
 
     Section 9.07
. Compensation and Reimbursement.
     The Company agrees
     (a) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation as shall be agreed in writing between the Company and the Trustee for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
     (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and
     (c) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.
     Section 9.08

     Section 9.09
. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
     There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has (or, in the case of a subsidiary of a bank holding company, its holding company parent shall have) a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
     Section 9.10
. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

     (b) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may, at the expense of the Company, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.
     (d) If at any time:

     (ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 9.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or
     (iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (A) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the Trustee, or (B) subject to Section 7.14, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
     (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee and supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
     In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee, such successor Trustee shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder. Upon the reasonable written request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts.
     No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under this Article.
     Section 9.12
. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee (including the administration of the trust created by this Indenture), shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so
 
authenticated with the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

     If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).
     Section 9.14
. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
     The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities issued upon original issue and upon exchange, registration of transfer, partial conversion or pursuant to Section 3.06, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.
     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate agency or corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.
 
     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall deliver written notice of such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register, or by such other means reasonably acceptable to such Holders. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
     The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions of Section 9.07.
     If an appointment is made pursuant to this Section, the Securities may have endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:
     This is one of the Securities described in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     (b) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such request, a list of similar form and content as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such list is furnished;

The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 10.01 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
     (b) The rights of Holders to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities, and the corresponding rights and duties of the Trustee, shall be as provided by the Trust Indenture Act.
     (c) Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of information as to names and addresses of Holders made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.
     Section 10.03

     If at any time the Company is not subject to Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall, during the first 12 months following the latest issue date of the Securities, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Trustee, each Holder, beneficial owner or prospective purchaser of such Securities or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act to facilitate the resale of such Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to take such other actions as any such Person may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Person to sell its Securities or Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time.
     Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only, and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely exclusively on an Officers' Certificate).
     Section 11.01
. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
     This Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to any surviving rights of conversion, registration of transfer or exchange of Securities herein expressly provided for), and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, when

     (ii) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
     (A) have become due and payable, or
     (B) at their Stated Maturity, and
     (C) the Company, in the case of (A) or (B) above, has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose, shares of Common Stock, lawful money of the United States or U.S. Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide lawful money not later than the due dates of principal or interest, or any combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal (and premium, if any) and interest to the date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Fundamental Change Repurchase Date, as the case may be;

Indemnification by the Company
provided
however
 
          (b) . Each Electing Holder agrees, as a consequence of the inclusion of any of such Electing Holder's Registrable Securities in such Shelf Registration Statement, and each underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional, if any, which facilitates the disposition of Registrable Securities shall agree, as a consequence of facilitating such disposition of Registrable Securities, severally and not jointly, to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, officers who sign any Shelf Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or such other persons may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Shelf Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Electing Holder, underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional expressly for use therein, and (ii) reimburse the Company and such other persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
Indemnification by the Electing Holders and any Agents and Underwriters
          (c) . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section 5, notify such indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; however, the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under the indemnification provisions of or contemplated by subsection (a) or (b) above. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, such indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 5 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Notices of Claims, Etc
          (d) . If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or by such indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Electing Holders or any underwriters, selling agents or other
Contribution
 
securities professionals or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 5(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Electing Holders and any underwriters, selling agents or other securities professionals in this Section 5(d) to contribute shall be several in proportion to the percentage of principal amount of Registrable Securities registered or underwritten, as the case may be, by them and not joint.
          (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5, in no event will any (i) Electing Holder be required to undertake liability to any person under this Section 5 for any amounts in excess of the dollar amount of the proceeds to be received by such Holder from the sale of such Holder's Registrable Securities (after deducting any fees, discounts and commissions applicable thereto) pursuant to any Shelf Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities are to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional be required to undertake liability to any person hereunder for any amounts in excess of the discount, commission or other compensation payable to such underwriter, selling agent or other securities professional with respect to the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public.
          (f) The obligations of the Company under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and the obligations of any Indemnified Person under this Section 5 shall be in addition to any liability which such Indemnified Person may otherwise have to the Company. The remedies provided in this Section 5 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to an indemnified party at law or in equity.

          (c) Any amounts to be paid as the Additional Interest pursuant to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 6 shall be paid in cash semi-annually in arrears, with the first semi-annual payment due on the first Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Indenture), as applicable, following such Registration Default Date or the date of such Effective Failure, as applicable. Such Additional Interest will accrue in respect of the Securities at the rates set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Section 6, as applicable, on the outstanding principal amount of the Securities.

Exhibit 99.1
NetApp Prices $1.1 Billion of Its 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013
NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) announced today that it has priced $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.75% convertible senior notes due in 2013. The notes will be sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. NetApp also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $165 million aggregate principal amount of notes solely to cover over-allotments. The sale is expected to close on June 10, 2008, subject to customary closing conditions.
Sunnyvale, Calif.  June 5, 2008 
The notes will be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash up to the principal amount of notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value, into shares of NetApp's common stock. The notes will have an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). This represents an initial effective conversion price of approximately $31.85 per share. The initial conversion price represents a premium of 35% to the closing price of NetApp's common stock on June 4, 2008, which was $23.59 per share.
The notes will be unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of NetApp, and interest will be payable semi-annually in cash at a rate of 1.75% per annum, and will be convertible upon satisfaction of certain conditions. NetApp estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $1,077 million, after deducting initial purchasers' discounts and estimated offering expenses. The notes will mature on June 1, 2013.
In connection with the offering, NetApp has entered into convertible note hedge transactions with counterparties (the "hedge counterparties"), some of which are affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes, and intends to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay for the convertible note hedge transactions. NetApp has also entered into separate warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties and will use the proceeds of those warrant transactions to partially offset the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions. The warrants have an exercise price of $41.28, which is approximately 75 percent above the closing price of NetApp's common stock on June 4, 2008. In connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties have advised NetApp that they or their affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock of NetApp and/or purchase common stock of NetApp or other securities linked to or referencing NetApp's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the price of the common stock of NetApp concurrently with or after the pricing of the notes. In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may from time to time enter into or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to the common stock of NetApp and/or purchase or sell common stock of NetApp or other securities linked to or referencing NetApp's common stock in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so during any observation period relating to the conversion of the notes). These activities could have the effect of
 
decreasing the price of the common stock of NetApp and could adversely affect the price of the notes during any observation period related to the conversion of notes.
NetApp expects to use (i) approximately $273.6 million of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock in negotiated transactions with institutional investors, through one or more of the initial purchasers as its agent, concurrently with the offering, (ii) a portion of the net proceeds for the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions described above, after such cost is offset by the proceeds received from the warrant transactions described above, and (iii) any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, possible future stock repurchases, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. The repurchase of such shares in connection with the offering could have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the common stock above levels that would otherwise have prevailed, or preventing, slowing or delaying a decline in such price. If the initial purchasers exercise the over-allotment option, NetApp intends to use any proceeds therefrom to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions and for general corporate purposes, and in such event also intends to enter into additional warrant transactions, which would result in the receipt of additional proceeds.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of NetApp common stock into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
The notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.
Cautionary Statement:
The statements in this release relating to the offering and the expected use of proceeds from the offering are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including, but not limited to, whether or not NetApp will consummate the offering, prevailing market conditions, the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering which could change as a result of market conditions or for other reasons, the fact that future share repurchases will depend upon market conditions, interest rates and corporate considerations and the impact of general economic, industry or political conditions in the United States or internationally.
Stockholders of NetApp are cautioned not to place undue reliance on its forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made. NetApp does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or new information after this June 4, 2008 press release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Item 5.02(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     On June 19, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of NetApp, Inc. (the "Company") approved compensation packages for fiscal year 2009 for the Company's senior executive officers, including the named executive officers. Effective August 4, 2008, the annual base salaries for fiscal year 2009 for the following named executive officers (including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer) will be:
     The approval of annual base salaries for the executives was based on an annual review of the compensation of senior management positions. Based on the results of the review, the Committee concluded that base salaries for certain executives, including certain of the named executive officers, was below market (based on a review of peer companies) and below the Company's own compensation target range, and therefore approved increases in base salaries accordingly.
     Target incentive compensation percentages (which are expressed as a percentage of annual base salary) remained unchanged for each of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2009.
     As part of its annual review and approval of total executive compensation, the Committee also approved Change of Control Severance Agreements (each, an "Agreement") for certain of the Company's senior executives, including each of the named executive officers. The material terms of the Agreements are as follows:
. If the Company terminates an executive's employment without Cause (as such term is defined in the Agreement) or if the executive resigns for Good Reason (as such term is defined in the Agreement), and such termination occurs on or within twelve (12) months after a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Agreement), then subject to the executive signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in favor of the Company, the executive will receive the following from the Company:
Severance Benefits
Table of Contents
. In the event that the severance payments and other benefits payable to an executive constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the U.S. tax code and would be subject to the applicable excise tax, then the executive's severance benefits will be either (i) delivered in full or (ii) delivered to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by the executive on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of benefits.
Excise Tax
. Each Agreement has an initial term of three (3) years, and will renew automatically for an additional one (1) year term unless either party to the Agreement provides the other with a notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the date of automatic renewal. If a Change of Control occurs at any time during the term of the Agreement, the term of the Agreement will automatically be extended for twelve (12) months following the effective date of the Change of Control. If an executive becomes entitled to severance benefits pursuant to his Agreement, the Agreement will not terminate until all obligations of the Company under the Agreement have been satisfied.
Term
Table of Contents
     The foregoing description of the material terms of the Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Agreements, the forms of which will be filed as exhibits to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for period ending July 25, 2008.

Our new fiscal year got off to a good start, and our efforts to increase awareness and sales capacity in order to secure new customers are delivering results, said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO. Despite economic uncertainty, customers have continued to expand and evolve their storage infrastructure and are looking to NetApp to help them reduce costs and enable new capabilities.
Outlook
NetApp estimates revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 to be between $910 million and $940 million.
NetApp estimates that the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 GAAP earnings per share will be approximately $0.16 to $0.19 per share. NetApp estimates second quarter fiscal year 2009 non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.27 to $0.30 per share.
Quarterly Highlights
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, NetApp launched new solutions that continue to help customers transform their data center architectures through higher efficiencies and asset utilization, greater power and space savings, innovative data management techniques, and the ability to reduce redundant data on primary storage with deduplication technology. Recognized by many industry awards, NetApp solutions continue to be a leader in the storage market in quality and innovation. Industry analyst reports during the quarter confirmed that NetApp continues to grow much faster than the overall storage market.
During the first quarter, NetApp announced the new FAS3100 and V3100 storage system series, Storage Acceleration Appliance, and Performance Acceleration Module which enable customers to achieve such benefits as accelerated time to market, improved engineering productivity, and maximized return on their storage infrastructure.
NetApp also announced that the NetApp V-Series now allows customers who have EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, Hewlett Packard, or other storage systems to deploy NetApp deduplication technology to reduce redundant copies of data on these systems. NetApp deduplication has quickly become one of the fastest growing technologies in the companys history.
Also during the quarter, NetApp expanded its portfolio of storage and data management solutions for virtualized IT environments that include Microsoft Windows Server 2008, Microsoft SQL Server 2008, Exchange Server 2007, and Microsoft Hyper-V. NetApp also added the availability of the SANscreen product suite, which was acquired in the acquisition of Onaro, to its global sales and channel partner programs.
NetApp continues to focus on expanding its worldwide channel strategy, programs, and best practices by rolling out the fiscal year 2009 VIP Program worldwide. This partner program demonstrates NetApps commitment to building upon its strong relationships with partners by enhancing key initiatives such as services and technology specialization programs.
NetApp products and solutions continue to be rated highly by third parties. During the quarter, NetApp received the following awards: Diogenes Labs Magazine Quality Awards III (), 2008 Products of the Year (), 2008 Product Excellence Awards (), 2008 Tomorrows Technology Today Award (), and 2008 Service and Support Professionals Association (SSPA) STAR Award.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related retention costs, net gain or loss on investments, prior acquisition-related costs, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 12, 2008--NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today reported results for the second fiscal quarter of 2009. Revenues for the second fiscal quarter of 2009 were $912 million, an increase of 15% compared to revenues of $792 million for the same period a year ago.
For the second fiscal quarter of 2009, GAAP net income was $49 million, or $0.15 per share compared to GAAP net income of $84 million, or $0.23 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the second fiscal quarter of 2009 was $92 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $116 million, or $0.32 per share for the same period a year ago.

Revenues for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $1.78 billion, compared to revenues of $1.48 billion for the first six months of the prior year, an increase of 20% year over year.
GAAP net income for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $87 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $118 million, or $0.32 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income for the first six months of the current fiscal year totaled $168 million, or $0.50 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $192 million, or $0.52 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year.
NetApp produced solid revenue and earnings results despite a challenging economic environment, said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO. More and more customers are turning to NetApp to drive down their storage costs by increasing their storage utilization. We expect NetApp's unique storage efficiency offerings to resonate well with customers, particularly during periods of constrained IT spending.
Outlook
Given the reduced visibility caused by the recent changes in the macroeconomic environment, NetApp will not be providing formal revenue guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.
NetApp estimates non-GAAP gross margins for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 to be substantially the same level as reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.
NetApp estimates non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 to be roughly flat from the operating expenses reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Quarterly Highlights
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, NetApp introduced new solutions that continue to help customers transform their data center architectures through higher efficiencies and asset utilization, greater power and space savings, and innovative data management techniques. NetApp also received many industry awards that recognize its leadership in quality, innovation, and service in the storage market.
NetApp launched a global program that offers customers a guarantee that they will use 50% less storage in their virtual environments with NetApp compared to traditional storage. NetApp wants to assure customers who choose NetApp and leverage its unique storage efficiency technologies that they will reduce their overall storage usage while improving performance.
3
During the second quarter, NetApp announced that it will be the first storage vendor to offer native Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) SAN storage solutions. FCoE support extends NetApp's unified storage architecture, enabling customers to address changing business needs and opportunities with flexible data access across all protocols.
NetApp announced the availability of deduplication on NetApp Virtual Tape Library (VTL) systems, enabling customers to lower the disk capacity required to back up any storage system, including EMC and HP, up to 95%.
4
During the quarter, NetApp announced the NetApp GetSuccessful Partner Enablement Program to help partners maximize strategic opportunities and distinguish themselves with their customers. The program is a new benefit of NetApps current VIP Partner Program and complements the Authorized Professional Service Provider and the Virtualization Specialization programs announced earlier this year.
NetApp continues to receive industry recognition from third parties. During the quarter, NetApp received the following awards:

These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results and metrics for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 and statements regarding our product and service offerings.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. These non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related retention costs, prior acquisition-related costs, net gain or loss on investments, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
NetApp Use of Corporate Web Site
In accordance with SEC guidance published on August 22, 2008 , NetApp will begin to disseminate material information about the company through its corporate Web site within the next several fiscal quarters. NetApp intends to designate a separate portion of its corporate Web site for purposes of these disclosures and will include a prominent link on its Web site to allow visitors to locate this material information, which will be routinely updated. The Web site will supplement, rather than replace, NetApp's current existing channels of information distribution.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
     On December 9, 2008, NetApp Inc. (the "Company") decided to cease development and availability of its SnapMirror for Open Systems (SMOS) product line. The Company originally acquired the product through its acquisition of Topio, Inc. in December 2006. The Company's facility in Haifa, Israel, currently employs 51 people and will be closed as of January 15, 2009. The Company has not made final employment decisions regarding its employees in Haifa. In connection with the decision to terminate further development and availability of the product line, the Company expects to incur charges of approximately $12 million to $14 million attributable primarily to the impairment of certain intangible assets from its acquisition of Topio, and approximately $5 million to $7 million related to the closure of the Haifa facility (of which up to $5 million may result in future cash expenditures, including lease termination payments and potential one-time severance and termination payments pending the outcome of employment decisions). Substantially all of these charges will be expensed in the third and fourth quarters of the Company's fiscal year ending April 24, 2009.
     The Company's decision to terminate SMOS product availability and development was based on customer priorities and actual purchase histories. The market for replication products for disaster recovery purposes is dominated by homogeneous, rather than multivendor, solutions. The Company's "any-to-any" solution with SMOS was never adopted by customers in the way the Company anticipated.

The restructuring was implemented in response to the worsening global macro-economic conditions and uncertainty about IT spending during the 2009 calendar year. In connection with this restructuring, the Company announced a workforce reduction of approximately 540 employees, or approximately 6%, of the Company's worldwide workforce. Of the aggregate restructuring charges noted above, the Company estimates that it will incur charges of approximately $25 million to $28 million related to termination and severance payments associated with the workforce restructuring, and an estimated additional $5 million to $7 million in lease termination charges and other costs related to the restructuring.

Exhibit 99.1
NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today reported results for the third fiscal quarter of 2009. Including the impact of a $128 million accrual to value a contingency related to a dispute with the General Services Administration (GSA), GAAP revenues for the third fiscal quarter of 2009 totaled $746 million compared to GAAP and Non-GAAP revenues of $884 million for the same period a year ago. Non-GAAP revenues for the third fiscal quarter, excluding the impact of the $128 million GSA accrual, totaled $874 million.
SUNNYVALE, Calif.  February 11, 2009

     GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $75 million, or $0.23 per share compared to GAAP net income of $102 million, or $0.29 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the third fiscal quarter of 2009 was $93 million, or $0.28 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $132 million, or $0.37 per share for the same period a year ago.

     GAAP revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $2.5 billion compared to GAAP and non-GAAP revenues of $2.4 billion for the first nine months of the prior year, an increase of 7% year over year. Non-GAAP revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year, excluding the impact of the $128 million GSA accrual, totaled $2.7 billion.
     GAAP net income for the first nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $11 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $220 million, or $0.60 per share for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income for the first
 
nine months of the current fiscal year totaled $262 million, or $0.78 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $324 million, or $0.89 per share for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year.
     "Business levels softened in January as many customers' budgets contracted, resulting in lower revenues than we had expected. At the same time, our storage efficiency value proposition resonates in challenging economic times, and we gained a record number of new customers during the quarter," said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO. "Operationally, the NetApp team also did a stellar job, decreasing non-GAAP operating expenses by $30 million in one quarter. However, we needed to make further reductions in order to optimize our resource allocation for our strategic growth initiatives. Therefore, we have implemented a restructuring that unfortunately includes the elimination of approximately 6% of our global workforce. While this was a very difficult decision, we believe our actions will best position the company for additional market share gains in the future."
Outlook
Given the reduced visibility caused by the recent changes in the macroeconomic environment, NetApp will not be providing formal revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Quarterly Highlights
     In the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, NetApp introduced several new solutions to help customers transform their data center architectures through greater storage efficiency, greater
 
power and space savings, and innovative data management techniques. The company also received industry recognition for its environmental, product, and operational excellence.
     During the quarter, NetApp was ranked number one by magazine on the "100 Best Companies to Work For" list. This is the second year it has achieved a top-10 ranking and the third consecutive year it has been named in the top 15. An egalitarian culture, competitive salaries, unique benefits, and a down-to-earth management style are attributes that have catapulted the company to the number-one spot for 2009. In addition, named NetApp as one of the Top Places to Work in Massachusetts.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the material and adverse global economic and market conditions that currently exist and that are expected to persist throughout calendar 2009, the final outcome of our GSA dispute with the federal government, our ability to build nondeferred backlog to levels consistent with our past results and to increase our revenue over the next several quarters; risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; risks with new product introductions; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers; our ability to expand our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels; our ability to develop, maintain, and strengthen our relationships and product offerings with strategic partners; risks associated with international operations; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other important factors as described in NetApp reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the factors described under the sections captioned "Risk Factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K and 10-Q.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. Non-GAAP revenues excludes the impact of the GSA accrual. These non-GAAP results of operations exclude the reserve for the GSA contingency, restructuring charges, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, asset impairment, acquisition-related retention costs, prior acquisition-related costs, net gain or loss on investments, and the related effects on income taxes as well as certain discrete GAAP provisions for income tax matters recognized ratably for non-GAAP purposes and the tax effect on sale of investments. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
NetApp Use of Corporate Web Site
In accordance with SEC guidance published on August 22, 2008 , NetApp will begin to disseminate material information about the company through its corporate Web site within the next several fiscal quarters. NetApp intends to designate a separate portion of its corporate Web site for purposes of these disclosures and will include a prominent link on its Web site to allow visitors to locate this material information, which will be routinely updated. The Web site will supplement, rather than replace, NetApp's current existing channels of information distribution.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     Effective as of April 7, 2009, NetApp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, NetApp U.S. Public Sector, Inc. (collectively, "NetApp"), entered into a settlement agreement (the "Agreement") with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and on behalf of the General Services Administration (the "GSA"). The Agreement relates to the previously-disclosed investigation which was being conducted by the GSA and the DOJ in connection with NetApp's GSA contracting activity, including NetApp's compliance with the price reduction clauses in certain of its contracts with the GSA between August 1997 and February 2005. In connection with the Agreement, NetApp has agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest accruing at a rate of 3% per annum from February 18, 2009 through the date on which the payment is actually made. NetApp is obligated to make the payments no later than April 27, 2009. In consideration for such payments, the parties to the Agreement have agreed to release NetApp with respect to the claims alleged in the investigation as set forth in the Agreement. The Agreement reflects neither an admission nor denial by NetApp of any of the claims alleged by the DOJ, and represents a compromise to avoid continued litigation and associated risks. As previously reported, NetApp recorded a $128.0 million accrual for this contingency in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.
     The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Agreement itself, which will be filed as an exhibit to NetApp's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ending April 24, 2009.

Exhibit 99.1
NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today reported results for the fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year 2009. Revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 totaled $880 million compared to revenues of $938 million for the same period a year ago.
SUNNYVALE, Calif.  May 20, 2009 
     For the fourth fiscal quarter, GAAP net income was $75 million, or $0.23 per share compared to GAAP net income of $90 million, or $0.26 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth fiscal quarter was $103 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $131 million, or $0.38 per share for the same period a year ago.

     For fiscal year 2009, GAAP revenues totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of 3% compared to GAAP revenues of $3.3 billion for fiscal year 2008. Non-GAAP revenues for fiscal year 2009, excluding the impact of the $129 million GSA settlement, were $3.5 billion. For fiscal year 2009, GAAP net income was $87 million, or $0.26 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $310 million, or $0.86 per share for fiscal year 2008. Non-GAAP net income for fiscal year 2009 was $364 million, or $1.09 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $455 million, or $1.26 per share for fiscal year 2008.
     "The NetApp team performed admirably to close a challenging fiscal year 2009," said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO. "With revenues up and expenses well contained, NetApp has delivered three consecutive quarters of increasing operating margins. Storage efficiency and storage for virtual server environments continue to be the primary demand drivers during this difficult economic period. Customers are increasingly turning to NetApp for help solving their storage and data management challenges in the face of shrinking budgets."
 
Outlook
Given the reduced visibility caused by the recent changes in the macroeconomic environment, NetApp will not be providing revenue guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Quarterly Highlights
     In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, NetApp introduced several new solutions to help customers transform their data center architectures through greater storage efficiency, greater power and space savings, and innovative data management techniques. The company also received industry recognition for its market leadership, product performance, and channel success.
     This quarter, NetApp and Cisco announced that they are teaming up to provide customers with unified, dynamic data center solutions that are based on the Cisco Unified Computing System and NetApp unified storage architecture.
     NetApp announced new storage and data management advances for VMware View to help customers deploy and operate virtual desktop environments faster and more efficiently, including NetApp's new Rapid Cloning Utility 2.0, which simplifies the way administrators clone VMware virtual machines and datastores. NetApp also announced the integration and certification of its storage platforms with VMware vSphere 4, which provides a path to virtualized data centers and cloud computing.
     During the quarter, NetApp extended its virtualization guarantee to include EMC, IBM, HP, and HDS storage systems by offering a guarantee that customers will decrease their non-NetApp primary storage capacity for virtual server environments by 35% using NetApp V-Series

and deduplication technology. NetApp deduplication has been delivered to more than 5,000 customers worldwide, comprising more than 30,000 systems containing 385PB of storage capacity.
     NetApp unveiled V-Series support for Texas Memory Systems' RamSan-500 solid-state disk (SSD) array. NetApp V-Series and Texas Memory Systems combine the full benefits of the NetApp Data ONTAP operating system with SSD storage to improve application performance and offer advanced features such as thin provisioning, Snapshot copies, and deduplication to improve storage efficiency and management.
     Also this quarter, NetApp introduced new functionalities for NetApp MetroCluster that offer customers continuous data availability in virtualized environments, the ability to perform nondisruptive software and hardware upgrades, and integration with NetApp deduplication technology for enhanced storage efficiency.
     During the quarter, NetApp received the following third party recognitions:

          (ii) 0.682 shares of NetApp common stock if the Closing Average is greater than $19.88, and
          (iii) that fraction of a share of NetApp common stock (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $13.55 by the Closing Average, if the Closing Average is (A) less than or equal to $19.88 and (B) greater than or equal to $16.26 (the per share amount of stock referenced in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, as applicable, being referred to as the "").
Stock Consideration
The "" is defined as the average of the closing sales prices for NetApp common stock, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent, on NASDAQ for the ten most recent consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.
Closing Average
In the event that the Exchange Ratio is greater than or equal to 0.750 and less than 0.833, NetApp, in its sole discretion, may (a) reduce the Stock Consideration by such amount as NetApp may determine and (b) increase the Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of the such reduction in the Stock Consideration multiplied by (ii) the Closing Average. However, NetApp may not reduce the amount of the Stock Consideration and increase the Cash Consideration to the extent that it would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, except as may be required as described in the paragraph below. The parties can make no assurances as to the tax-free status of the transaction.
If the aggregate amount of the Stock Consideration issuable in the Merger (including Stock Consideration issuable to holders of Data Domain options, restricted stock and restricted shares) would exceed 19.5% of the outstanding shares of NetApp common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, the Stock Consideration will be decreased to the minimum extent necessary so that no more than 19.5% of the outstanding shares of NetApp common stock will be issued in the Merger (with such percentage measured immediately prior to the closing of the Merger). In such event, the Cash Consideration will be increased by an amount equal to the product of (a) the amount of the reduction in the Stock Consideration multiplied by (b) the Closing Average.
Each of Data Domain's options to purchase common stock of Data Domain outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be assumed by NetApp, and, at the closing of the Merger, be converted into the right to receive NetApp stock options, based on an exchange ratio specified in the Merger Agreement.

Each of Data Domain's restricted shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration, subject to any forfeiture provisions applicable to such securities. Each of Data Domain's restricted stock units outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration based on a formula specified in the Merger Agreement, subject to any vesting provisions applicable to such securities.

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION
     NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Data Domain (NASDAQ:DDUP) announced today they have entered into a definitive agreement under which NetApp will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Data Domain common stock for $25 per share in cash and stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $1.5B, net of Data Domain's cash.
Sunnyvale, Calif. and Santa Clara, Calif.  May 20, 2009
     "This combination is a great opportunity for both NetApp and Data Domain," said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO of NetApp. "Data Domain is an innovative high-growth company with a complementary product line ideally suited for multi-vendor environments where customers want to minimize their use of tape for backup. NetApp has the distribution channels and international reach to offer Data Domain products to more customers, accelerating growth and market adoption. The combination of our two companies will increase NetApp's reputation for delivering both outstanding efficiency and operational breakthroughs to customers worldwide."
     Customers will benefit from the robust worldwide sales, support, partner, and service network NetApp can bring to Data Domain products, further enabling customers to deploy Data Domain products on a global basis. NetApp and Data Domain channel partners will benefit from the inclusion of the innovative Data Domain product line into the NetApp Partner Program.
     NetApp intends to operate Data Domain as a product line within NetApp's product operations organization. The Data Domain sales organization will be integrated with NetApp sales to maximize momentum and access new accounts.
 
     "Our objective will be to amplify Data Domain's success, grow Data Domain's revenues as quickly as today's economy will allow, and create systems and incentives within NetApp to nurture Data Domain to its fullest potential," added Warmenhoven. "We will focus on new customer acquisition and maximum market share expansion. Their existing customers should see the benefits of NetApp's broader scale and support capabilities."
     "Notwithstanding the rapid record sales growth Data Domain has experienced over the past 5 years, with NetApp's distribution channel and customer base, we have an opportunity to accelerate even further," said Frank Slootman, president and CEO of Data Domain.
Portfolio Synergy
     The Data Domain portfolio brings a complementary offering to NetApp, expanding NetApp's reach in the market for heterogeneous disk-based backup. Today, NetApp's heterogeneous backup offering (with its VTL product line) provides installations with disk-based solutions to augment their tape backup infrastructure. Data Domain's portfolio will extend NetApp's ability to compete in the increasing number of installations wanting to minimize their reliance on tape. The Data Domain acquisition increases NetApp's ability to capitalize on the growth of disk-based backup adoption, a trend accelerated by the economics of deduplication.
Transaction Details
     The Board of Directors of Data Domain has unanimously approved the transaction. We anticipate that the deal will close in 60-120 days subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval.
     More details on this transaction will be available on NetApp's quarterly results conference call which will be broadcast live on the Internet at on Wednesday, May 20, 2009, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The conference call will also be

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 3, 2009, NetApp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""), Data Domain, Inc., a Delaware corporation (""), Kentucky Merger Sub One Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of NetApp (""), and Derby Merger Sub Two LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of NetApp ("" and together with Merger Sub One, the ""), entered into Amendment No. 1 (the "") to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 20, 2009, by and among NetApp, Data Domain and the Merger Subs (as amended, the ""). Under the revised terms, the aggregate merger consideration payable by NetApp to the Data Domain stockholders in connection with the Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement) has been increased from $25 per share to $30 per share, as described below.

Amendment
Merger Agreement
As amended, upon the closing of the Merger, each outstanding share of Data Domain common stock (other than those shares with respect to which appraisal rights are properly exercised and not withdrawn) will be converted into the right to receive (a) $16.45 per share in cash, without interest (the per share amount of cash being referred to as the ""), plus (b) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of NetApp common stock equal to the following exchange ratio (the ""):
Cash Consideration
Exchange Ratio
     (i) 0.7783 shares of NetApp common stock if the Closing Average (as defined below) is less than $17.41,
     (ii) 0.6370 shares of NetApp common stock if the Closing Average is greater than $21.27, and
     (iii) that fraction of a share of NetApp common stock (rounded to the nearest ten thousandth) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $13.55 by the Closing Average, if the Closing Average is (A) less than or equal to $21.27 and (B) greater than or equal to $17.41 (the per share amount of stock referenced in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, as applicable, being referred to as the "").
Stock Consideration
The "" is defined as the average of the closing sales prices for NetApp common stock, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent, on NASDAQ for the ten most recent consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the closing of the Merger.
Closing Average
In the event that the Exchange Ratio is greater than or equal to 0.7006 and less than 0.7783, NetApp, in its sole discretion, may (a) reduce the Stock Consideration by such amount as NetApp may determine and (b) increase the Cash Consideration by an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of the such reduction in the Stock Consideration multiplied by (ii) the Closing Average. However, NetApp may not reduce the amount of the Stock Consideration and increase the Cash Consideration to the extent that it would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code, except as may be required as described in the paragraph below. The parties can make no assurances as to the tax-free status of the transaction.
If the aggregate amount of the Stock Consideration issuable in the Merger (including Stock Consideration issuable to holders of Data Domain options, restricted stock and restricted shares) would exceed 19.5% of the outstanding shares of NetApp common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, the Stock Consideration will be decreased to the minimum extent necessary so that no more than 19.5% of the outstanding shares of NetApp common stock will be issued in the Merger (with such percentage measured immediately prior to the closing of the Merger). In such event, the Cash Consideration will be increased by an amount equal to the product of (a) the amount of the reduction in the Stock Consideration multiplied by (b) the Closing Average.
Other than as described above, the Merger Agreement, as filed on May 21, 2009 on a Current Report on Form 8-K, remains in full force and effect as originally executed on May 20, 2009. The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated into this report by reference.
 
Item 8.01 Other Information.
On June 3, 2009, NetApp issued a press release relating to its offer to increase the merger consideration payable by NetApp to the Data Domain stockholders in connection with the Merger. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Later on the same day, NetApp and Data Domain issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Amendment by the parties. A copy of the joint press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3.

Exhibit 99.1
NetApp Makes Revised Offer to Acquire Data Domain
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) today announced that it has made a revised proposal to acquire Data Domain (NASDAQ:DDUP). Under the terms of the proposal, a copy of which is attached, NetApp will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Data Domain common stock for $30 per share in cash and stock in a transaction valued at approximately $1.9B, net of Data Domain's cash, subject to certain adjustments.
Sunnyvale, Calif.June 3, 2009
"Our strategic rationale remains the same and we firmly believe that the combination of our two companies will provide a greater opportunity and risk-adjusted value for Data Domain shareholders, customers, and partners," said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO of NetApp. "The complementary nature of the Data Domain and NetApp product lines will result in higher aggregate growth compared to the redundancies that would result with the EMC product line."
The Data Domain portfolio provides NetApp a complementary offering to expand its reach in the market for heterogeneous disk-based backup. The Data Domain acquisition will increase NetApp's ability to capitalize on the growth of disk-based backup adoption, a trend accelerated by the economics of deduplication.
NetApp's offer for Data Domain is also superior to EMC's previously announced, unsolicited proposal, as it offers a combination of value certainty and the opportunity for Data Domain shareholders to participate in the future success of the combined NetApp and Data Domain entity.
Warmenhoven added, "The cultural compatibility between Data Domain and NetApp will maximize the potential for continued innovation from a creative and motivated employee base. This will not only create a meaningful choice for our customers but also lead to a complementary combination with no obstacles to an expeditious close of the acquisition. Therefore, we are as committed to this partnership now as we were when we first announced our intent to acquire Data Domain."
NetApp first announced its definitive agreement to acquire Data Domain on May 20, 2009. For complete details on this acquisition, visit the page NetApp to Acquire Data Domain or www.netapp.com.

Exhibit 99.2
June 2, 2009
Aneel Bhusri Chairman of the Board of Directors Data Domain, Inc. 2421 Mission College Boulevard Santa Clara, CA 95054
Dear Aneel:
On behalf of NetApp, I am pleased to reiterate our continued interest and enthusiasm for a potential combination of Data Domain and NetApp. As you know, we believe that a combination has the potential to create a combined company that is unparalleled in its position to add real value for our customers by solving their storage efficiency needs.
In light of EMC's recently announced unsolicited proposal to acquire Data Domain, we would like to propose a revised transaction between NetApp and Data Domain which we believe offers Data Domain's stockholders a superior combination of risk-adjusted value and transaction certainty than EMC's unsolicited acquisition proposal.
Pursuant to the terms of the attached amendment to our existing Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), we are proposing to revise the Merger Agreement to deliver $30 per share in total value to Data Domain stockholders, consisting of $16.45 per share in cash (before any adjustments described in Sections 2.7(b)(i) and 2.7(b)(ii) of the Merger Agreement) and $13.55 per share in NetApp stock based on NetApp's closing share price on June 2, 2009 of $19.34. As with the terms of our existing Merger Agreement, our amended Merger Agreement would include a 10% symmetrical collar, centered on a midpoint derived from NetApp's closing share price of $19.34. Accordingly, the exchange ratio for the stock component of the merger consideration set forth in the amended Merger Agreement would be equal to (i) 0.7783 shares of NetApp common stock if the "Closing Average" (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than $17.41, (ii) 0.6370 shares of NetApp common stock if the "Closing Average" is greater than $21.27, and (iii) that fraction of a share of NetApp common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $13.55 by the "Closing Average", if the "Closing Average" is (A) less than or equal to $21.27 and (B) greater than or equal to $17.41. In order to maximize deal certainty, NetApp would expect to use cash to settle the low end of the collar. Under the terms of our proposal, all other terms of the amended Merger Agreement would remain unchanged from those set forth in the existing Merger Agreement.
 
We believe this proposal offers Data Domain stockholders more compelling risk-adjusted value than EMC's current acquisition proposal for several reasons. First, it offers a combination of value certainty  through the cash and the collar  coupled with the potential for long-term value upside through the ongoing ownership of NetApp stock. Second, the stock portion of the transaction consideration is expected to be tax-free to Data Domain stockholders. And third and potentially most important, we believe that a combination of Data Domain and NetApp offers clearly superior transaction certainty. Unlike a combination of Data Domain and EMC, which has substantial product overlap and which we believe will face significant regulatory challenges, a combination of Data Domain and NetApp has no meaningful regulatory risk.
We look forward to discussing the terms of this proposal in greater detail at your earliest convenience. For your convenience and to express the sincerity of our intent, we have included a signed copy of our proposed amendment to the Merger Agreement. We note, however, that this proposal and the Merger Agreement amendment attached hereto are non-binding and we reserve the right to withdraw this proposal and the Merger Agreement amendment at any time unless and until the signed copy of the Merger Agreement amendment attached hereto is counter-signed by Data Domain and returned to us without any revisions thereto. Any purported revisions to the attached Merger Agreement amendment shall not be accepted by us and shall be considered void, notwithstanding the execution thereof by Data Domain.
Sincerely, Steven Gomo

Exhibit 99.3
FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION
NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Data Domain (NASDAQ:DDUP) today announced that they have entered into a revised acquisition agreement under which NetApp will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Data Domain common stock for $30 per share in cash and stock in a transaction valued at approximately $1.9B, net of Data Domain's cash.
Sunnyvale, Calif. and Santa Clara, Calif.June 3, 2009
"We are excited about this great opportunity for NetApp and Data Domain," said Dan Warmenhoven, chairman and CEO of NetApp. "The synergies between our two companies will enable us to accelerate growth and market adoption more so than as separate entities. This partnership will create meaningful benefits for our global customers."
"We are pleased with the revised terms of NetApp's acquisition offer and feel it will provide great value to our shareholders and customers," said Frank Slootman, president and CEO of Data Domain.
Transaction Details
Data Domain stockholders will have a right to receive a cash amount of $16.45 plus shares of NetApp common stock equal to the exchange ratio for each Data Domain share. The exchange ratio is equal to (i) 0.7783 shares of NetApp common stock if the "Closing Average" (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is less than $17.41, (ii) 0.6370 shares of NetApp common stock if the Closing Average is greater than $21.27, and (iii) that fraction of a share of NetApp common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $13.55 by the Closing Average, if the Closing Average is (A) less than or equal to $21.27 and (B) greater than or equal to $17.41. The closing average means the average of the closing sales prices for NetApp common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the 10 most recent consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the closing of the first-step merger. Under
 
certain conditions, NetApp may elect to reduce, or may be required to reduce, the stock consideration, and, in the event of such a reduction, NetApp will be required to increase the cash consideration.
The Board of Directors of Data Domain has unanimously approved the revised transaction agreement. The deal is anticipated to close in 60-110 days subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval.
NetApp first announced its definitive agreement to acquire Data Domain on May 20, 2009. For complete details on this acquisition, visit the page or .

NetApp Declines to Revise Bid for Data Domain; Merger Agreement Terminated NetApp to Focus on Its Existing Growth Opportunities
NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today announced that it will not revise its proposal to acquire Data Domain (NASDAQ:DDUP) in the wake of EMC's higher unsolicited offer, and that NetApp and Data Domain have terminated their merger Terminated agreement. NetApp confirmed that it has received a $57 million break-up fee from Data Domain as a result of the termination of the agreement.
Sunnyvale, CA  July 8, 2009 
"While NetApp's acquisition of Data Domain would have produced benefits for customers and employees and complemented NetApp's existing growth trajectory, we remain highly confident in our already compelling strategic plan, market opportunities, and competitive strengths," said Dan Warmenhoven, NetApp's chairman and CEO. "NetApp applies a disciplined approach to acquisitions, one focused intently on creating long-term value for our stockholders. We therefore cannot justify engaging in an increasingly expensive and dilutive bidding war that would diminish the deal's strategic and financial benefits."
"NetApp has established leadership positions in virtualized infrastructure, storage efficiency, and unified storage, even in these difficult economic times, by helping customers meet their business objectives with less physical storage while reducing costs. That commitment will not change. We look forward to continuing to build on our foundation of innovation and customer service, and to continuing to execute our successful growth strategy."

NetApp Announces Results for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2010
SUNNYVALE, CA -- (Marketwire - August 19, 2009) - NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, which ended July 31, 2009. Revenues for the first fiscal quarter of 2010 were $838 million, down 4% compared to revenues of $869 million for the same period a year ago.
For the first fiscal quarter of 2010, GAAP net income was $52 million, or $0.15 per share(1) compared to GAAP net income of $35 million, or $0.10 per share for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP(2) net income for the first fiscal quarter of 2010 was $76 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $76 million, or $0.22 per share for the same period a year ago.
"Given the economic backdrop, NetApp performed well in the first quarter. With year over year revenue growth roughly flat on a constant currency basis, our revenue performance clearly outpaced the storage industry at large," said Tom Georgens, president and chief executive officer. "Our operating income and operating margin both increased year over year, and we produced our highest gross margin percentage in over five years."
"Today we are also announcing that Tom Georgens, NetApp's president and chief operating officer, is succeeding me as CEO in the culmination of a management succession process. Over the past four years, he has proven his leadership capabilities in both strategy development and day-to-day operations," said Dan Warmenhoven, executive chairman. "His appointment represents a continuity in leadership at NetApp. The company is well positioned and I look forward to supporting Tom as he leads NetApp to the next stages of growth."
Outlook
Given the reduced visibility caused by the recent changes in the macroeconomic environment, NetApp will not be providing revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
NetApp estimates non-GAAP gross margins for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 to be between 62.5% and 63.0%.
NetApp estimates non-GAAP operating expense levels for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 to be in a range around $425 million.
NetApp estimates non-GAAP other income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 to remain at similar levels to those reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Quarterly Highlights
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, NetApp introduced several new products, solutions, and partner program enhancements to help customers transform their data center architectures to achieve greater storage efficiency, power, and space savings through innovative data management techniques. NetApp also received numerous industry accolades, including seven global awards for being one of the best places to work.
For the quarter, NetApp customers continue to adopt deduplication at a rapid pace. With unique NetApp technology, customers are able to eliminate redundant data across all tiers of storage, allowing them to combat data proliferation while creating a more efficient storage infrastructure. More than 7,200 NetApp customers have activated deduplication on over 37,000 systems, representing 514PB in usable storage capacity.
During the quarter, NetApp introduced System Manager to expand its manageability software offerings with a solution that enables storage experts and non-storage experts to easily leverage NetApp's proven storage efficiency technologies, such as deduplication and thin provisioning, to achieve greater cost savings and performance improvements. In addition, NetApp's existing manageability products, which include Operations Manager, Protection Manager, and Provisioning Manager, now support a wider range of NetApp storage efficiency features. This enables customers managing a large number of NetApp systems to automatically configure and deploy different storage efficiency technologies across their entire enterprise environment.
This quarter, NetApp announced the availability of the first consolidated reference guide for a 2,000-seat pool of desktops (POD)-based architecture to help customers deploy VMware View on NetApp and Cisco Nexus infrastructures. The guide provides customers with the framework to deploy their own integrated desktop virtualization solutions quickly and cost-effectively and to easily scale incrementally to meet ever-changing business needs.
NetApp also unveiled new program enhancements for its reseller partners. The NetApp Partner Program, formerly known as the VIP Program, continues to build on the channel program initiatives for which NetApp has become known over the years, with new investments in infrastructure and enablement tools to help make doing business with NetApp easier for partners. In addition, the NetApp Partner Program now officially encompasses all indirect selling partner types, including NetApp's OEM partners, to align all indirect efforts under one global program. The new program enhancements include NetApp Field Portal, Campaign Express, and the NetApp GetSuccessful Partner Enablement Program.
Separately, NetApp also offered channel resellers specialized training and accreditation for Microsoft virtualization environments by expanding its Virtualization Specialization Program to include Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V technology. Now NetApp resellers can provide their customers with greater value and expertise with Hyper-V and NetApp solutions.
Finally, in addition to NetApp's various solution and partner announcements during the quarter, the company received the following awards and industry recognition:
NetApp was named the Microsoft 2009 Partner of the Year in the Advanced Infrastructure, Storage Solutions category.

"Safe Harbor" Statement Under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results and metrics for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 and the benefits that we expect our customers to realize from using our products. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the material and adverse global economic and market conditions that currently exist and that are expected to persist throughout calendar 2009; our ability to build non-deferred backlog to levels consistent with our past results and to increase our revenue over the next several quarters; risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; risks with new product introductions; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and successfully manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers; our ability to expand our direct sales operations and reseller distribution channels; our ability to develop, maintain, and strengthen our relationships and product offerings with strategic partners; risks associated with international operations; our ability to successfully acquire and integrate complementary businesses and technologies; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other important factors as described in NetApp reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections captioned "Risk Factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. Non-GAAP results of operations exclude the GSA settlement, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, merger termination proceeds (net of related expenses), restructuring and other charges, non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of FSP APB 14-1, net loss on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, but includes a proforma tax provision based upon our projected annual proforma effective tax rate. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
NetApp Use of Corporate Web Site
In accordance with SEC guidance published on August 22, 2008 (Release No. 34-58288), NetApp will begin to disseminate material information about the company through its corporate Web site within the next several fiscal quarters. NetApp intends to designate a separate portion of its corporate Web site for purposes of these disclosures and will include a prominent link on its Web site to allow visitors to locate this material information, which will be routinely updated. The Web site will supplement, rather than replace, NetApp's current existing channels of information distribution.

     The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". The following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in "Item 1. Business" of our Fiscal 2009 Form 10-K are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference.
Overview
     Fiscal 2009 was characterized initially by a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment with continued deterioration in global economic conditions as the year progressed. Customers were faced with data volumes that continued to grow and shrinking or frozen capital budgets. As a result, customers postponed many IT projects and looked for solutions that provided a rapid return on their investment  typically less than twelve months. Server virtualization remained one of the most often funded IT projects, due to the cost savings it produces. NetApp has been a direct beneficiary of the trend towards server virtualization because of the unique storage efficiency features we provide along with our ability to virtualize the storage infrastructure. With our software intensive solutions, we offer customers greater functionality, easier manageability and a smaller hardware footprint, helping them to meet their business objectives with less physical storage and a lower total cost of ownership. As a result, NetApp gained a significant number of new customer accounts in fiscal 2009.
     However, revenue from new accounts was not enough to offset the slowdown in spending from many of our largest accounts, and our overall revenue growth slowed relative to previous years. Our largest accounts contributed to a significant level of hardware service contract and software entitlement and maintenance contract renewals, demonstrating continued commitment to NetApp technology in their data centers while at the same time delaying capital expenditures amidst an uncertain economic environment.
     Net revenues increased by 3.1% to $3,406.4 million in fiscal 2009, from $3,303.2 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in software entitlements and maintenance revenues as well as service revenues, partially offset by decreases in product revenues and a negative impact from a GSA settlement. The $128.7 million GSA settlement was related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of a GSA contract between August 1997 and February 2005.
     NetApp implemented comprehensive expense reduction programs in fiscal 2009 as the global macroeconomic conditions worsened. We decided to cease development and availability of our SnapMirror for Open Systems ("SMOS") product. We also implemented a worldwide restructuring program which included a reduction in workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities. As a result of these programs, we recognized total restructuring charges of $51.5 million, including the severance costs related to the elimination of approximately 450 regular positions, contract cancellation charges, write offs of intangible and fixed assets and costs association with the closure of some of our facilities; as well as $2.9 million of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives. Our actions were intended to better align our cost structure with expected revenues, as well as to reallocate resources into areas of our business with more growth potential.
     As a result of the financial crisis during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $29.6 million on our investments which resulted from direct and indirect exposure to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities and other-than-temporary declines in the value of our auction rate securities and investments in privately held companies. The volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.
     Despite the current challenging economic environment, we believe there are fundamental aspects of our business that will allow us to succeed over the long term. We believe that our products and services provide customers with valuable storage solutions, even in a more constrained spending environment. We also believe that our investments in branding, awareness and new customer acquisition will lead to an increase in our market share once the economy begins to recover. However, continued revenue growth depends on the introduction and market acceptance of new products and solutions and continued market demand for our products. We will continue
 
our focus on expense management while improving our resource allocation to fund investment in strategic initiatives. Our actions are designed to preserve our revenue-generating potential, increase our focus on key growth opportunities, and at the same time improve operating leverage over the long term.
     
Subsequent Event
     On May 20, 2009, we entered into an agreement to acquire Data Domain, a leading provider of storage solutions for backup and archive applications based on deduplication technology. Data Domain deduplication storage systems are designed to deliver reliable, efficient and cost-effective solutions that enable enterprises of all sizes to manage, retain and protect their data. The agreement was subsequently amended on June 3, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive merger agreement relating to the merger, each share of Data Domain common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, subject to adjustment, a combination of $16.45 in cash and a certain number of shares of our common stock, calculated based on an exchange ratio.
     The merger, if completed, may result in material but indeterminable increases in our revenues, operating results, financial position and cash flows. While we anticipate cost synergies associated with combining facilities, IT infrastructure, and certain functions such as finance, human resources and administrative services with those of Data Domain, differences between our and Data Domain's operations could cause unforeseen delays in the integration process, result in lower savings than originally anticipated, or both, which could adversely affect NetApp's business and operating results.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies
     Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results may vary from our estimates.
     We believe that the following accounting policies are "critical" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We also have other important policies, including those related to derivative instruments and concentration of credit risk. However, these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective. These policies are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements accompanying our Fiscal 2009 Form 10-K.
     We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations:
 
Revenue Recognition and Allowances
     We apply the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, (SOP No. 97-2), and related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and software, because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:
Software Revenue Recognition
     Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered software-related elements: software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance, and storage review services. Our software entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell technical consulting services separately from any of our other revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining costs are accrued, as the remaining undelivered services are considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory. For arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements ("the residual method").
     For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the provisions of SOP No. 97-2 and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately either alone, in the case of software entitlements and maintenance, or as a bundled element which always includes software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware maintenance, and may also include storage review services. To determine the fair value of these elements, we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements, paragraph 12 of SOP No. 97-2 would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered.
     For income statement presentation purposes, once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder allocated to other service revenues.
     We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required.
 
     We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjust it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance. Our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of April 24, 2009 was $3.1 million, compared to $2.4 million as of April 25, 2008. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
     
Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles
     Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over time, while in-process research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized, subject to periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results. The allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be different than management's current assessment, material write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. A reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such, any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect our operating results.
     Under our accounting policy we perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill, the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment. Should conditions be different from management's last assessment, significant write-downs of goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. In fiscal 2009 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment of goodwill. As of April 24, 2009, our assets included $681.0 million in goodwill. See Note 12, "Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets," to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
     In fiscal 2009, we increased goodwill by $0.9 million relating to the tax benefits associated with the subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed Spinnaker and Onaro options. During fiscal 2008, we recorded goodwill of $79.2 million in connection with our Onaro acquisition and a decrease of goodwill for $0.2 million in connection with the escrow received from our Topio acquisition in fiscal 2007.
     
Accounting for Income Taxes
     The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the United States and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate.
     We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 109, "" SFAS No. 109 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. SFAS No. 109 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We have provided a valuation allowance of $28.0 million as of April 24, 2009, compared to $28.6 million as of April 25, 2008 on certain of our deferred tax assets. The $0.5 million decrease in valuation allowance in fiscal 2009 was primarily related to changes in the blended state tax rates. Tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options
Accounting for Income Taxes.
 
are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123R, we do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. The tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance at April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008 are $278.9 million and $245.1 million, respectively.
     On April 28, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. As a result of the implementation of FIN No. 48, we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of issues under audit, and new exposures. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination.
     We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the United States and several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our intellectual property ("IP") are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations, which have resulted in material proposed assessments and/or pending litigation. Effective September 27, 2007, the IRS's Large and Mid-Sized Business Division ("LMSB") released a Coordinated Issues Paper ("CIP") with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements ("CSAs"). Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied to evaluate the arm's length charge (buy-in payment) for internally developed (pre-existing) as well as acquisition-related intangible property that is made available to a qualified CSA. During fiscal year 2009 we received Notices of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with a federal income tax audit of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 tax year tax returns. We recently filed a protest with the IRS in response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustments. The Notices of Proposed Adjustments focus primarily on issues of the timing and the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years. If upon the conclusion of these audits the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these tax jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded in the applicable period or subsequently reserved for, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be adversely impacted in the period of adjustment.
     Effective March 20, 2008, the IRS's LMSB also released a CIP with respect to the cost sharing of stock based compensation. Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel concerning stock based compensation related to a CSA by providing that the parties to a CSA will share all costs related to intangible development of the covered intangibles, including but not limited to, salaries, bonuses, and other payroll costs and benefits. Taxpayers should include all forms of compensation in the cost pool, including those costs related to stock-based compensation. On May 27, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner that stock-based compensation must be included in the research and development cost base of companies that have entered into a CSA and must, therefore, be allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits. The Court's reversal of the prior U.S. Tax Court decision will impact our estimate of tax benefits that were required to be recognized under FIN 48. We are evaluating the impact of the Xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2010, but expect any final adjustment will be limited to a reduction of our unrecognized tax attributes. Our international operations currently benefit from a tax ruling concluded in the Netherlands, which expires in 2010. If we are unable to negotiate a similar tax ruling upon expiration of the current ruling, our effective tax rate could increase and our operating results could be adversely affected. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results.
     The Obama administration recently announced several proposals to reform United States tax rules, including proposals that may result in a reduction or elimination of the deferral of United States income tax on our future unrepatriated earnings. Absent a restructuring of some legal entities and their functionality, the changes as currently proposed would result in some of the future unrepatriated earnings being taxed at the United States federal income tax rate.
     
Inventory Write-Downs
 
     Our inventory balance was $61.1 million as of April 24, 2009, compared to $70.2 million as of April 25, 2008. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis). We perform an in-depth excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and on our reported results. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross margins in the period when the written-down inventory is sold. During the past few years, our inventory reserves have been sufficient to cover excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material changes in subsequent periods.
     We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products, which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture. We will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations, which may require us to incur higher costs, and adversely impact our operating results.
     
Restructuring Accruals
     In fiscal 2009 we recorded restructuring and other charges of $54.4 million. We recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred. The restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded. These estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded. The main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reduction, intangibles and fixed assets write-offs and non-cancelable lease costs related to excess facilities. Severance-related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. We record contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated. The decision to eliminate excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. Intangible asset write-offs consist of impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision to cease the development and availability of SMOS. Fixed assets write-offs primarily consist of equipment and furniture associated with excess facilities being eliminated, and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture.
     Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals, including the various assumptions noted above. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future.
     
Impairment Losses on Investments
     All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including factors such as current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security's issuer, the length of time an investment's fair value has been below our carrying value, our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. If an investment's decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or other metrics. For investments in publicly held companies, we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be other-than-temporary. The ultimate value realized on these investments in publicly held companies is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.
     We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, our short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities have been classified as "available-for-sale" and are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by us are classified as available-for-sale and our entire auction rate securities (ARS) portfolio and our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund ("Primary Fund") are classified as long-term investments.
 
     Our ARS are securities with long-term nominal maturities which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately $7.0 million during fiscal 2009, partially offset by $0.3 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2.1 million due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.
     During fiscal 2008 and 2007, recognized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments were not material. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in long-term investments, was $1.2 billion and $543.2 million as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively.
     The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ARS included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows, discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity. These assumptions, assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties, are difficult to predict and require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. There is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize. The fair value of our ARS could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio. We will continue to monitor the fair value of our ARS and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or other-than-temporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges.
     As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. As of April 24, 2009, we have an investment in the Primary Fund, an AAA-rated money market fund at the time of purchase, with a par value of $60.9 million and an estimated fair value of $51.6 million, which suspended redemptions in September 2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments. The Primary Fund suspended redemptions in September 2008, and on December 3, 2008, it announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of assets that includes the establishment of a special reserve to be set aside out of its assets for pending or threatened claims, as well as anticipated costs and expenses, including related legal and accounting fees. On February 26, 2009, the Primary Fund announced a plan to set aside $3.5 billion of the fund's remaining assets as the "special reserve" which may be increased or decreased as further information becomes available. Our pro rata share of the $3.5 billion special reserve is approximately $41.5 million. The Primary Fund announced plans to continue to make periodic distributions, up to the amount of the special reserve, on a pro-rata basis. The Primary Fund has received an SEC order providing that the SEC will supervise the distribution of assets from the Primary Fund. We could realize additional losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund
     To determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments, we use the most recent information available to us, including new financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as through traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies. This evaluation includes, but is not limited to, reviewing company cash position, financing needs and prospects, earnings or revenue outlook, operational performance, management or ownership changes and competition. This information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as United States publicly-traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value, and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value. The carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies were $4.0 million and $11.2 million as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, we recorded $6.3 million and $1.6 million of impairment charges, respectively, for our investments in privately-held companies, which were recorded in net gain (loss) on investments in our consolidated statements of operations, and adjusted the carrying amount of those investments to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the value of these assets to be other-than-temporary.
     
Fair Value Measurements
     We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 157, "" effective April 26, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when
Fair Value Measurements,
 
available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.
     The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below:
     We measure our available-for-sale securities at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-sale securities include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, corporate securities, auction rate securities money market funds and certificates of deposit. Where possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. When quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable, varying valuation techniques are used. Such assets are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy. We classify items in Level 2 if the investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We classify items in Level 3 if the investments are valued using a pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the market or require us to develop our own assumptions. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment.
     We evaluate our investments for other-than-temporary impairment in accordance with guidance provided by SFAS No. 115, and related guidance. We consider and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the significance of the loss incurred, the financial condition and credit rating of the issuer and insurance guarantor, the length of time the investments have been illiquid, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value.
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities"
     We are also exposed to market risk relating to our available-for-sale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $21.1 million in fiscal 2009 related to Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments, as well as an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $2.1 million related to the value of our ARS. The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges. We could realize additional losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund.
     
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
     We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, "," using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our employee stock options. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected life, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions may significantly impact the stock-based compensation expense for the future.
Share-Based Payment
 
     
Loss Contingencies
     We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and on behalf of the General Services Administration (the "GSA"), under which we agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005 in consideration for the release of NetApp by the DOJ and GSA with respect to the claims alleged in the investigation as set forth in the settlement agreement. The agreement reflects neither an admission nor denial by NetApp of any of the claims alleged by the DOJ and represents a compromise to avoid continued litigation and associated risks. NetApp made the settlement payment on April 27, 2009. In fiscal 2008 and 2007, we did not identify or accrue for any loss contingencies. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted.
New Accounting Standards
     See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.
Results of Operations
     The following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statements of Operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated:
 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
      Our net revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:
Net Revenues
     Net revenues increased by 3.1% to $3,406.4 million in fiscal 2009, from $3,303.2 million in fiscal 2008. The increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2009 was due to increases in software entitlements and maintenance revenues as well as service revenues, partially offset by decreases in product revenues, and the negative impact from the GSA settlement.
     Net revenues increased by 17.8% to $3,303.2 million in fiscal 2008, from $2,804.3 million in fiscal 2007. Our fiscal 2008 revenue growth was attributable to increased product revenues, software entitlements and maintenance revenues, and service.
     Sales through our indirect channels represented 69.0%, 63.0% and 59.6% of net revenues for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     During fiscal 2009, two U.S. distributors accounted for approximately 10.5% and 10.6% of our net revenues, respectively. No distributor or other customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net revenues during fiscal 2008 and 2007.
     
Product Revenues
     Product revenues decreased by $89.8 million, or 4.0% in fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008. Unit volume increased, driven by smaller, low end systems, partially offset by decreases in mid-range and high end systems. This trend is consistent with a shift in customer buying patterns towards smaller systems, due to IT spending constraints and difficult economic conditions. In addition, average selling prices declined, driven by lower list prices, unfavorable configuration mix (consisting of hardware and software components, disk capacity and disk price) and higher discounting, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2009. Partially offsetting these factors was an increase in revenues from add-on products, as customers focused more on extending the useful lives and capacity of their existing storage solutions.
     Product revenues increased by $156.6 million or 7.5% to $2,242.5 million in fiscal 2008, from $2,085.9 million in fiscal 2007. Unit volume increased, driven by low end and mid-range systems, partially offset by a slight decrease in high end systems. In addition, average selling prices increased, driven by higher list prices and favorable configuration mix, partially offset by higher discounting. Revenue from add-on products increased, as customers focused on extending the capacity of their storage solutions.
     Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve. This wide variation in customer configurations can significantly impact revenue, cost of revenue, and gross margin performance. Price changes, unit volumes, and product configuration mix can also impact revenue, cost of revenue and gross margin performance. Disks are a significant component of our storage systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall every year, and we pass along those price decreases to our customers while working to maintain relatively constant margins on our disk drives. While price per petabyte continues to decline, system performance, increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product revenue.
     
Software Entitlements and Maintenance Revenues
 
     Software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by $131.5 million, or 27.0% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. This year over year increase in software entitlements and maintenance revenues was due primarily to the recognition of service contracts that were purchased or renewed in prior years, and to a lesser extent, service contracts entered into in fiscal 2009.
     Software entitlements and maintenance revenues increased by $145.6 million, or 42.7% in fiscal 2008, compared to fiscal 2007. The year over year increase was due to a larger installed base of customers who have purchased or renewed software entitlements and maintenance.
     
Service Revenues
     Service revenues increased by $190.3 million, or 33.2% in fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008. Service revenues include service maintenance, professional services and educational and training services. The primary reason for the increase was increased service contract revenue related to an increase in the installed base. In addition, revenue from professional services increased due to increased integration consulting services provided in fiscal 2009 and improved productivity of our professional service personnel.
     Service revenues increased by $196.7 million, or 52.1% in fiscal 2008, compared to fiscal 2007. The primary reasons for the increase were increased service contract revenue, related to an increase in the installed base and the average revenue generated per installed base unit, and an increase in professional services.
     
GSA settlement
     In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice and on behalf of the General Services Administration (the "GSA"), under which we agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of its GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005. We have recorded the settlement as a reduction of revenues in fiscal 2009.
     
Total International Revenues
     Total international revenues (including U.S. exports) increased by 6.3% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Total international revenues (including U.S. exports) increased by 23.9% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007.
     
Cost of Revenues
     Our cost of revenue includes: (1) cost of product revenue, which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping our storage systems, and amortization of purchased intangible assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs; (2) cost of software maintenance and entitlements, which includes the costs of providing software entitlements and maintenance and third party royalty costs, and (3) cost of service, which reflects costs associated with providing services for support center activities and global service partnership programs.
 
     
Cost of Product Revenues
     Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased by 5.0% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in total costs was primarily due to increased unit volume. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenues was due to a larger decrease in average selling prices than corresponding costs, primarily standard material costs, across all of our systems.
     Cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased by 1.6% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in total costs was primarily due to increased unit volume. The increase in costs as a percentage of revenues was due to a lower increase in average selling prices than corresponding costs, primarily related to standard material costs on new low end systems.
     Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of product revenues was $3.3 million, $3.4 million and $3.7 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Amortization of existing technology included in cost of product revenues was $24.5 million, $22.6 million and $17.6 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a change in the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost of product revenues. These costs were included in cost of service revenues in previous periods. Our cost of product revenues and service revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 reflect a reclassification of $27.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively, to conform to current period presentation. There was no change in warranty costs as a percentage of product revenue in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.
     We expect future product gross margins to be impacted by a variety of factors including selective price reductions and discounts, increased indirect channel sales, higher software revenue mix and the margin profile of new products. If our shipment volumes, product mix, average selling prices and pricing actions that impact our product gross margin continue to be adversely affected by the economic downturn or market factors, our gross margin could decline.
     
Cost of Software Entitlements and Maintenance Revenues
     Cost of software entitlements and maintenance revenues as a percentage of software entitlements and maintenance revenue remained relatively flat at 1.5% in fiscal 2009 and 1.8% in fiscal 2008, respectively. Cost of software entitlements and maintenance revenues as a percentage of software entitlements and maintenance revenue decreased in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower third-party royalty expenses.
     
Cost of Service Revenues
 
     Cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenue decreased by 7.4% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 and by 7.0% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in service cost of revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased service infrastructure spending to support our customers, which included additional professional support engineers, increased support center activities for a larger installed base of product, and global service partnership programs. The decrease in service cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased service revenue volume and improved productivity, partially offset by higher costs.
     Stock-based compensation expense of $12.3 million was included in the cost of service revenue for fiscal 2009 compared to $10.4 million and $10.1 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a change in the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost of product revenues. These costs were included in cost of service revenues in previous periods. Our cost of product revenues and service revenues for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 reflect a reclassification of $27.0 million and $22.1 million, respectively, to conform to current period presentation.
     Service gross margin is also typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our installed base of product, as well as the timing of support service initiations and renewals, and incremental investments in our customer support infrastructure.
      Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions, allocated facilities and IT costs, advertising and promotional expenses, stock-based compensation expense, and travel and entertainment expenses. Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:
Sales and Marketing
     Sales and marketing expense increased by $110.5 million, or 10.3% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits primarily due to increased average compensation and incentive plan costs per person, and an increase in IT expenses related to new software implementations partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses and travel and entertainment expenses.
     The increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due to increased commission expenses resulting from increased revenues, higher payroll expenses due to higher profitability, higher partner program expenses, the continued worldwide investment in our sales and global service organizations associated with selling complete enterprise solutions, and higher stock-based compensation expenses.
     Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies (primarily Euro, British pound and Australian Dollar). Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2009 would have been approximately $10.5 million higher, or 0.9%, higher. The foreign currency exchange rate impact on sales and marketing expense was insignificant for fiscal 2008 and 2007.
     Stock-based compensation expense included in sales and marketing expense in fiscal 2009 was $65.1 million compared to stock compensation expense of $65.4 million and $71.7 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Amortization of trademarks/trade names and customer contracts/relationships included in sales and marketing expense was $4.4 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $4.2 million and $2.9 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively.
      Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits, allocated facilities and IT costs, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and prototype and engineering charges. Research and development expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:
Research and Development
 
     Research and development expense increased by $46.3 million, or 10.2% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related benefits resulting from increased average compensation and incentive plan costs per person, as well as higher average headcount, and an increase in facilities expenses related to new engineering labs.
     The increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due increased headcount, ongoing operating impact of acquisitions, ongoing current and future product development and enhancement efforts, higher performance-based payroll expenses due to higher profitability, and higher stock-based compensation expense.
     Stock-based compensation expense included in research and development expense for fiscal 2009 was $37.9 million, compared to $46.6 million and $51.3 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. No software development costs were capitalized during any of the periods.
     We believe that our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line, develop new products that achieve market acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness, and meet an expanding range of customer requirements. We expect to continuously support current and future product development, broaden our existing product offerings and introduce new products that expand our solutions portfolio.
      General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits, professional and corporate legal fees, stock-based compensation, recruiting expenses, and allocated facilities and IT costs. General and administrative expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:
General and Administrative
     General and administrative expense increased by $32.2 million, or 18.7% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to increased professional and legal fees, an increase in salaries and related benefits primarily resulting from increased average compensation and incentive plan costs per person, and an increase in IT expenses.
     The increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to higher payroll expenses due to higher profitability and increased headcount, higher stock-based compensation expense recognized, and higher legal and professional fees for general corporate matters.
     Stock-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense in fiscal 2009 was $22.2 million compared to $22.1 million and $26.2 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
     
Restructuring and Other Charges
     In February 2009, we announced our decision to execute a worldwide restructuring program, which included a reduction in workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease the development and availability of SMOS, which was originally acquired through our acquisition of Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this decision, we also announced the closure of our engineering facility in Haifa, Israel. These restructuring activities resulted in restructuring charges totaling $51.5 million of severance-related amounts and other charges attributable to the termination of approximately 450 regular positions, abandoned excess facilities charges relating to non-cancelable lease costs, which are net of expected sublease income; contract cancellation charges; outplacement expenses; fixed assets and intangibles write-offs; as well as $2.9 million of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives. In recording the facility lease restructuring reserve, we made certain estimates and assumptions related to the (i) time period over which the relevant buildings would remain vacant, (ii) sublease terms, and (iii) sublease rates.
Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plans 
     As of April 24, 2009, approximately $15.9 million of the costs associated with these activities were unpaid. We expect that severance-related charges and other costs will be substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the facilities-related lease payments to be substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
 
     As of April 24, 2009, we also have $1.3 million remaining in facility restructuring reserves established as part of a restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. During fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring recoveries of $0.1 million resulting from a change in the estimated operating expenses relating to this facility restructuring reserve. We expect to substantially fulfill the remaining contractual obligations related to this facility restructuring reserve by fiscal 2011.
Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan 
     Of the restructuring reserve balance at April 24, 2009, $14.7 million was included in other accrued liabilities, and the remaining $2.5 million was classified as other long-term obligations.
     See Note 13, "Restructuring and Other Charges," of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring activities.
     
Other Income and Expense
      Interest income for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:
Interest Income
     The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower market yields on our cash and investment portfolio, in part due to a shift of our portfolio to shorter term investments with lower risk. This yield decline was partially offset by an increase in our cash and investment balances due to the issuance of the Convertible Notes (the "Notes"), see Note 4, "Convertible Notes and Credit Facilities" of the consolidated financial statements. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower cash and investment balances.
     We expect that period-to-period changes in interest income will continue to be impacted by the volatility of market interest rates, cash and investment balances, cash generated by operations, timing of our stock repurchases, cash used in acquisitions, capital expenditures, and payments of our contractual obligations.
      Interest expense for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:
Interest Expense
     The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to interest expense on our Notes, including $41.0 million of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, partially offset by lower interest expense related to the reduced outstanding balance on our secured credit agreement we entered into with JPMorgan in October 2007. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was due to full repayment of the loan agreement entered with JPMorgan, partially offset by increased interest expense on the $250.0 million outstanding under the revolving secured credit agreement with JPMorgan Securities during fiscal 2008.
     We expect period-to-period changes in interest expense to fluctuate based on market interest rate volatility and amounts that may be due from time to time under various outstanding debt agreements.
 
Gain (Loss) on Investments, Net 
     During fiscal 2009, net loss on investments of $29.6 million included a net impairment loss related to our investments in privately held companies of $6.3 million, an other-than-temporary impairment charge on our available-for-sale investments related to direct and indirect investments in Lehman Brothers securities of $21.1 million, and a decline in the value of our auction rate securities of $2.1 million.
     Net gain on sale of investments was $12.6 million for fiscal 2008. Net gain for fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of a gain of $13.6 million related to the sale of shares of Blue Coat common stock offset by a net write-down of $1.0 million for our investments in privately-held companies. For fiscal 2007, net loss on sale of investments was $1.5 million, including a net write-down of $2.1 million related to the impairment of our investment in privately-held companies.
Other Income (Expense), Net 
     Other income (expense), net, consists of primarily net exchange losses and gains from foreign currency transactions and related hedging activities. We believe that period-to-period changes in foreign exchange gains or losses will continue to be impacted by hedging costs associated with our forward and option activities and forecast variance.
     
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
     For fiscal 2009, we applied to pretax income an effective tax rate benefit of 597.5% before discrete reporting items. After taking into account the tax effect of federal research tax credit and other immaterial items, the effective tax rate benefit for fiscal 2009 was 681.5%, and the effective tax rate expense for fiscal 2008 and 2007 was 19.1% and 17.2%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009, which was negative and thus a benefit, decreased relative to the effective tax rate for fiscal, 2008 primarily due to the decrease in the U.S. portion of our income and to the benefits generated from the retroactive extension of the research and development tax credit which was part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The geographic composition of our consolidated income was impacted by losses generated in the U.S. for restructuring charges, coupon and non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt and the GSA settlement. These charges resulted in a taxable loss in the U.S. which primarily drove the tax benefit.
     For fiscal 2008 and 2007, we applied to pretax income an annual effective tax rate before discrete reporting items of 13.3% and 19.0%, respectively. The decrease in the annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to a relative increase in the benefits attributable to our foreign operations, as well as to a relative decrease in the tax impact of nondeductible stock-based compensation, brought about in part by our decision to cease granting incentive stock options. Since we have replaced the granting of incentive stock options with the granting of nonqualified stock options, this gives rise to the recognition of more income tax benefits as stock-based compensation is recognized.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
     The following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flow on our liquidity and capital resources. The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 24, 2009.
 
     
Liquidity Sources, Cash Requirements
     Our principal sources of liquidity as of April 24, 2009, consisted of: (1) approximately $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, (2) cash we expect to generate from operations, and (3) an unsecured revolving credit facility totaling $250.0 million, of which $0.6 million has been allocated as of April 24, 2009 to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit. Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, including a one-time payment of $128.7 million related to our GSA settlement, support ongoing business activities, implement restructuring plans, research and development, capital expenditure needs, the proposed Data Domain acquisition and other business acquisitions, investment in critical or complementary technologies, and to service our debt and synthetic leases.
     Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability as well as our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable and inventories and whether or not we ultimately complete the merger with Data Domain discussed below. Based on our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions. In light of the current economic and market conditions, we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all.
     Our investment portfolio, including the Primary Fund and auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge to earnings of $21.1 million related to Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. In addition, we also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $2.1 million relating to certain auction rate securities. We could realize additional losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund. However, we are not dependent on liquidating these investments in the next twelve months in order to meet our liquidity needs. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio. Based on our ability to access our cash and short-term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and our other potential sources of cash, we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other cash requirements. We intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers. If current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in future quarters.
     
Capital Expenditure Requirements
     We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities and equipment operating leases over the next few years through cash generated from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents and investments. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products, product mix, changes in the network storage industry, economic conditions and market competition. We expect that our existing facilities in Sunnyvale, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years, and that additional space will be available as needed. However, if current economic conditions deteriorate further, we may be required to implement additional restructuring plans to eliminate or consolidate excess facilities, incur cancellation penalties and impair fixed assets.
     
Acquisition Related Requirements
     On May 20, 2009, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement with Data Domain, Inc. to acquire such company in a merger for an aggregate merger consideration of approximately $1.5 billion in cash and common stock (net of Data Domain's cash balances). On June 3, 2009, we revised the terms of the definitive agreement to increase the aggregate merger consideration to $1.9 billion (net of Data Domain's cash balance). If the acquisition is completed under the current terms, we expect that we will have to use at least $1 billion of our cash, cash equivalent and investments for cash consideration to Data Domain shareholders and transaction costs. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The transaction is valued at approximately $2 billion and is expected to be completed in 60 to 120 days.
 
     
Cash Flows
     As of April 24, 2009, compared to April 25, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $1,439.8 million to $2,604.2 million. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily a result of net proceeds from issuance of the Notes and warrants, cash provided by operating activities, issuance of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, partially offset by stock repurchases, execution of the Note Hedge, capital expenditures, and repayment of the secured revolving credit facility. We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital. Working capital increased by $1,106.1 million to $1,759.5 million as of April 24, 2009, compared to $653.3 million as of April 25, 2008.
     
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
     During fiscal 2009, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $889.2 million, compared with $1,008.9 million and $864.5 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We recorded net income of $64.6 million for fiscal 2009, compared to $309.7 million and $297.7 million for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. A summary of the significant changes in noncash adjustments affecting net income and changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows is as follows:
 
     Other changes in prepaid expenses, other accrued liabilities, income taxes payable, and other liabilities balances were due to timing of payments versus recognition of assets or liabilities. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), accounts receivable collections, inventory and supply chain management, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments.
     
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
     Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $289.7 million as compared to $188.3 million and $165.8 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. We used $116.8 million in fiscal 2009 and received $376.4 million and $187.9 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, for net purchases and redemptions of short-term investments, and restricted investments. During fiscal 2009, we reclassified $598.0 million of cash equivalents relating to the Primary Fund to short-term investments. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we received $1.1 million, $19.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, from the sale of nonmarketable and marketable securities. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we also used $0.3 million, $4.2 million and $1.6 million for purchases of nonmarketable and marketable securities. In fiscal 2008, we acquired Onaro, Inc. and remitted total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling $99.6 million and received $0.2 million escrow related to our Topio acquisition. In fiscal 2007, we acquired Topio, Inc. and remitted total cash payments including related transaction costs totaling $131.2 million. In fiscal 2007, we received $23.9 million in cash in connection with the sale of certain assets to Blue Coat.
     
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
     We received $696.6 million in fiscal 2009 and used $662.4 million and $747.3 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively from financing activities. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we made repayments of $172.6 million, $231.5 million and $214.9 million, respectively, in connection with our Secured Credit Agreement and the Term Loan. We repurchased 17.0 million, 32.8 million and 22.6 million shares of common stock for a total of $400.0 million, $903.7 million and $805.7 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases were $91.0 million, $114.7 million and $215.5 million in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Tax benefits, related to tax deductions in excess of stock-based compensation expense recognized, of $36.7 million, $45.4 million and $63.2 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we withheld shares with an aggregate value of $5.1 million, $6.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, in connection with the vesting of certain employees' restricted stock units for purposes of satisfying those employees' federal, state, and local withholding tax obligations. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we issued $1.265 billion of convertible notes and paid financing costs of $26.6 million. We also received proceeds of $163.1 million for sale of common stock warrants, and paid $254.9 million for purchase of Note Hedges. During fiscal 2008, we borrowed $318.8 million through a Secured Credit Agreement.
     Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock. As a result, our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee participation in employee stock programs and related tax benefits will vary.
     
Stock Repurchase Program
     At April 24, 2009, $1,096.3 million remained available for future repurchases under plans approved as of that date. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
 
     
Convertible Notes
     In June 2008, we issued $1.265 billion of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 and concurrently entered into Note Hedges and separate warrant transactions. See Note 4, "Convertible Notes and Credit Facilities" of the consolidated financial statements. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013, unless earlier repurchased or converted. As of April 24, 2009, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants.
     
Credit Facilities
     As of April 24, 2009, we have an unsecured revolving credit facility totaling $250.0 million, of which $0.6 million has been allocated as of April 24, 2009 to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit (See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements.)
     This credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial covenants, with which we were in compliance as of April 24, 2009. Such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments. Our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the credit facilities, which would give the counterparties thereto the ability to exercise certain rights, including the right to accelerate the amounts outstanding thereunder and to terminate the facility. We were in compliance with all of our financial covenants at April 24, 2009.
     
Contractual Obligations
     The following summarizes our contractual obligations at April 24, 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:
     For purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable, are legally binding on us, and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement. Some of the figures we include in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and third parties, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table.
 
 
     We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with BNPPLC for approximately 564,274 square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. As of April 24, 2009, we have a leasing arrangements ("Leasing Arrangements 1") which requires us to lease a portion of our land in Sunnyvale to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 190,000 square feet of space costing up to $48.5 million. As of April 24, 2009, we also have commitments relating to financing and operating leasing arrangements with BNPPLC ("Leasing Arrangements 2, 3, 4") for land and approximately 374,274 square feet of buildings located in Sunnyvale, California, costing up to $101.1 million. Under these leasing arrangements, we began paying BNPPLC minimum lease payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates. We will make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease terms, we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 24, 2009, and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements:
 
     All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 24, 2009. Such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments. Our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which, subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase option, would give BNPPLC the right to, among other things, (i) terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements, or (ii) exercise certain foreclosure remedies. If we were to exercise our purchase option, or be required to pay lease termination damages, these payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity, which could constrain our operating flexibility.
     We may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our operating or other objectives. For example, on April 1, 2009, we terminated two leasing arrangement in connection with two buildings located in Sunnyvale, California and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and repaid $119.3 million of the outstanding balance under the leasing arrangements. On December 1, 2008, we terminated a leasing arrangement in connection with a separate building located in Sunnyvale, California and repaid $8.1 million of the outstanding balance drawn under the construction allowance. As a result of these terminations, we are no longer contractually obligated to pay the lease payments for the lease periods and the residual guarantees.
     
Legal Contingencies
     On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in January 2008. The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase and no trial date has been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of April 24, 2009.
     In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and on behalf of the General Services Administration (the "GSA"), under which we agreed to pay the United States $128.0 million, plus interest of $0.7 million, related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005.
     In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, operating results, or financial condition.
     
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
     During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries. As of April 24, 2009, our financial guarantees of $5.9 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers' compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds, which were primarily related to self-insurance.
 
     We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below:
     As of April 24, 2009, our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled $314.0 million. We do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks, because the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid.
     We have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45, of FIN No. 45,
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others."
     We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with BNPPLC for approximately 564,274 square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California (as further described above under "Contractual Obligations").
     We have evaluated our accounting for these leases under the provisions of FIN No. 46R and have determined the following:
     Accordingly, under the provisions of FIN No. 46R, we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the BNPPLC lease. Our future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estate leases will amount to a total of $141.1 million as reported under our Note 15, "Commitments and Contingencies."
     We also have operating leases for various facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was $28.8 million for fiscal 2009, $29.6 million for fiscal 2008, and $24.0 million for fiscal 2007.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
     We are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates, market prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All financial instruments are used in accordance with management-approved policies.
 
Market Risk and Market Interest Risk
      As of April 24, 2009, we had available-for-sale investments of $1,228.2 million. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of greater than three months, which are classified as available-for-sale. These investments, consisting primarily of corporate bonds, corporate securities, U.S. government agency bonds, U.S. Treasuries, certificates of deposit, and money market funds, are subject to interest rate and interest income risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates from levels at April 24, 2009 would cause the fair value of these available-for-sale investments to decline by approximately $1.6 million. Because we have the ability to hold these investments until maturity, we would not expect any significant decline in value of our investments caused by market interest rate changes. Declines in interest rates over time will, however, reduce our interest income. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.
Investment and Interest Income
     Our investment policy is to limit credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer. We actively review, along with our investment advisors, current investment ratings, company specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our investments and in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, we recorded in fiscal 2009 an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the Reserve Primary Fund, which also held Lehman Brothers investments. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges. We could realize additional losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund.
     We are also exposed to market risk relating to our auction rate securities due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. As of April 24, 2009, we determined there was a total decline in the fair value of our auction rate securities investments of approximately $8.8 million, of which we recorded temporary impairment charges of $7.0 million, offset by unrealized gains of $0.3 million, and $2.1 million was recognized as an other-than-temporary impairment charge. The fair value of our auction rate securities may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities. Changes in the various assumptions used to value these securities and any increase in the markets' perceived risk associated with such investments may also result in a decline in estimated fair value.
     If current market conditions deteriorate further, or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur, we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in other comprehensive income (loss) or other-than-temporary impairment charges to earnings in future quarters. We intend and have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers. We do not believe that the lack of liquidity relating to our portfolio investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures or other operating requirements. See Note 8, "Fair Value Measurement," to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Liquidity and Capital Resources," in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value and liquidity of the investments in our portfolio that we held at April 24, 2009.
      As of April 24, 2009, one of our four lease arrangements with BNPPLC is based on a floating interest rate. The minimum lease payments will vary based on LIBOR plus a spread. All of our leases have a term of five years, and we have the option to renew these leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. A hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rate from the level at April 24, 2009 would increase our lease payments on this one floating lease arrangement under the initial five-year term by an immaterial amount. We do not currently hedge against market interest rate increases. As additional cash flow generated from operations is invested at current market rates, it will offer a natural hedge against interest rate risk from our lease commitments in the event of a significant change in market interest rate.
Lease Commitments
      In June 2008, we issued $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Notes due 2013, of which $1.017 billion was allocated to debt and $0.248 billion was allocated to equity, (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock, up to the principal amount of the Note. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or in stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into
Convertible Notes
 
convertible note hedge transactions and separately, warrant transactions, to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes and to mitigate any negative effect such conversion may have on the price of our common stock.
     The fair value of our Notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the convertible feature. Generally, the fair value of Notes will increase as interest rates fall and/or our common stock price increases, and decrease as interest rates rise and/or our common stock price decreases. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of our Notes, but do not impact our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligations. We do not carry the Notes at fair value, but present the fair value of the principal amount of our Notes for disclosure purposes. As of April 24, 2009, the principal amount of our Notes, which consists of the combined debt and equity components, was $1.265 billion, and the total estimated fair value of such was $1.143 billion based on the closing trading price of $90.38 per $100 of our Notes as of that date.
      We have from time to time made cash investments in companies with distinctive technologies that are potentially strategically important to us. Our investments in nonmarketable securities would be negatively affected by an adverse change in equity market prices, although the impact cannot be directly quantified. Such a change, or any negative change in the financial performance or prospects of the companies whose nonmarketable securities we own, would harm the ability of these companies to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize any gains or return of our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings, acquisitions, and private sales. These types of investments involve a high degree of risk, and there can be no assurance that any company we invest in will grow or be successful. We do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce or eliminate equity price risk with respect to such nonmarketable investments. Accordingly, we could lose all or part of these investments if there is an adverse change in the market price of a company we invest in. Our investments in nonmarketable securities had a carrying amount of $4.0 million as of April 24, 2009 and $11.2 million as of April 25, 2008. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value exists for a nonmarketable equity security, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the related write-down as an investment loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal 2009, we recorded net losses of $6.3 million for our investments in privately held companies.
Nonmarketable Securities
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts
     We hedge risks associated with foreign currency transactions to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings. We utilize forward and option contracts to hedge against the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. All balance sheet hedges are marked to market through earnings every period. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to forecasted sales transactions. These derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. For cash flow hedges outstanding at April 24, 2009, the time-value component is recorded in earnings while all other gains or losses were included in other comprehensive income.
     We do not enter into foreign exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes. In entering into forward and option foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with creditworthy multinational commercial banks. All contracts have a maturity of less than one year.
 
Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of NetApp, Inc. Sunnyvale, California
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended April 24, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NetApp, Inc. and subsidiaries as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 24, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
     As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in the year ended April 25, 2008, the Company changed its method of measuring and recognizing tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, . In addition, as discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 25, 2009, the Company changed its method of accounting for convertible debt instruments in accordance with FASB Staff Position APB 14-1: ("FSP APB 14-1") and accordingly retrospectively adjusted the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of April 24, 2009 and for the year then ended for the changes required by this statement.

1. The Company
     Based in Sunnyvale, California, NetApp, Inc. ("we" or "the Company") was incorporated in California in April 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2001; in March 2008, the Company changed its name from Network Appliance, Inc. to NetApp, Inc. The Company is a supplier of enterprise storage and data management software and hardware products and services. Our solutions help global enterprises meet major information technology challenges such as managing storage growth, assuring secure and timely information access, protecting data and controlling costs by providing innovative solutions that simplify the complexity associated with managing corporate data.
2. Significant Accounting Policies
      We operate on a 52-week or 53-week year ending on the last Friday in April. Fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were all 52-week fiscal years.
Fiscal Year
      The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Basis of Presentation
     In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position Accounting Principles Board No. 14-1, ")" ("FSP APB No. 14-1"), which requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer's non-convertible debt borrowing rate. FSP APB 14-1 applies to the $1,265,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes".) (See Note 4 "Convertible Notes and Credit Facilities".) FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008 and is applied retrospectively. The Company adopted FSP APB 14-1 on April 25, 2009, which is reflected on a retrospective basis as of April 24, 2009 and for the fiscal year then ended. The information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto reflect only the adjustments described below and do not reflect events occurring after June 17, 2009, the original filing date of our Fiscal 2009 Form 10-K, or modify or update those disclosures that may have been effected by subsequent events.
Retrospective Application of Accounting Standard to Previously Issued Financial Statements
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement
     The adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1 impacted the accounting for our Notes by requiring the initial proceeds to be allocated between a liability and an equity component, if appropriate, based on the fair value of the debt component as of the issuance date. The initial debt component of the Notes is based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance, with the equity component representing the residual amount of the proceeds. The debt discount and the issuance costs allocated to the debt component are amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method.
     Upon the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1, we also recorded adjustments to income taxes to reflect the impact of the foregoing adjustments.
     The following financial statement line items as of April 24, 2009 and for the year then ended were impacted by the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1:
 
     In addition, the adoption of FSP APB No. 14-1 resulted in changes to our consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the year ended April 24, 2009 and to Notes 2, 4, 6, 7 and 16.
      In the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we implemented a change in the reporting of warranty costs and reported these costs in cost of product revenues. These costs, which were included in cost of service revenues in previous periods, amounted to $26,997 and $22,082 for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively, and have been reclassified on the accompanying financial statements to conform to current year classification. This change had no effect on the reported amounts of total costs of revenues, total gross margin, net income or cash flow from operations for any period presented.
Reclassification
      The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition and allowances; allowance for doubtful accounts; valuation of goodwill and intangibles; fair value of derivative instruments and related hedged items; accounting for income taxes; inventory valuation and contractual commitments; restructuring accruals; warranty reserve; impairment losses on investments; fair value of options granted under our stock-based compensation plans; and loss contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Use of Estimates
      Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments, foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and money market funds, all of which are considered high investment grade. Our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly rated securities. We further mitigate concentrations of credit risk in our investments by limiting our investments in the debt securities of a single issuer and by diversifying risk across geographies and type of issuer.
Concentration of Credit Risk
     Our long term investments, including the Primary Fund and auction rate securities have been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge to earnings of $23,251 related to auction rate securities, Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments.
     In entering into forward foreign exchange contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The counterparties to these contracts are major multinational commercial banks, and we do not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults.
     We sell our products primarily to large organizations in different industries and geographies. We do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. In addition, we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. To reduce credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers' financial condition. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers, historical trends and other information and, to date, such losses have been within management's expectations. No customer represented more than 10% of accounts receivables in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the wide variety of customers who are dispersed across many geographic regions.
 
      There are no concentrations of business transacted with a particular market that would severely impact our business in the near term. However, we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components and a few key contract manufacturers to manufacture most of our products; any disruption or termination of these arrangements could materially adversely affect our operating results.
Risk and Uncertainties
      Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period from nonowner sources. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gain, and losses on derivatives and unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities, which includes a temporary impairment charge of $7,037 and $3,500 in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, associated with our auction rate securities. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion regarding this unrealized loss.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
     Other comprehensive income (loss) for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been disclosed within the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income.
     The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the end of each fiscal year, were as follows (net of related tax effects):
      We consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
      As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, our short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities have been classified as "available-for-sale" and are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term investments as these investments generally consist of highly marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by us are classified as available-for-sale and our entire auction rate securities (ARS) portfolio and our investment in the Reserve Primary Fund ("Primary Fund") are classified as long-term investments.
Marketable Securities
     Our ARS are securities with long-term nominal maturities which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately $7,037 during fiscal 2009, partially offset by $296 in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2,122 due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.
     As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $11,831 on our corporate bonds related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately $9,298 on our investments in the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. As of April 24, 2009, we have an investment in the Primary Fund, an AAA-rated money market fund at the time of purchase, with a par value of $60,928 and an estimated fair value of $51,630, which suspended redemptions in September 2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments. On December 3, 2008, it announced a plan for liquidation and distribution of assets that includes the establishment of a special reserve to be set aside out of its assets for pending or threatened claims, as well as anticipated costs and expenses, including related legal and accounting fees. On February 26, 2009, the Primary Fund announced a plan to set aside $3,500,000 of the fund's remaining assets as the "special reserve" which may be increased or decreased as further information becomes available. Our pro rata share of the $3,500,000 special reserve is approximately $41,455. The Primary Fund announced plans to continue to make periodic distributions, up to the amount of the special reserve, on a pro-rata basis. The Primary Fund has received an United States Security Exchange Commission order providing that the SEC will supervise the distribution of assets from the Primary Fund. We could realize additional
 
losses in our holdings of the Primary Fund and may not receive all or a portion of our remaining balance in the Primary Fund as a result of market conditions and ongoing litigation against the fund.
     During fiscal 2008 and 2007, recognized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments were not material. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in long-term investments, was $1,228,220 and $543,226 as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively.
      We have certain investments in nonpublicly- traded companies in which we have less than 20% of the voting rights and in which we do not exercise significant influence and accordingly, we account for these investments under the cost method. As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, $3,969 and $11,169 of these investments are included in long-term investments on the accompanying balance sheet. We perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a loss of $6,320 related to our investments in privately held companies.
Investments in Nonpublic Companies
      All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including factors such as current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security's issuer, the length of time an investment's fair value has been below our carrying value, the extent to which fair value was below cost, and our ability and intent to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in value. If an investment's decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market prices or liquidation values. Declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are recorded in operations as incurred. For long-term investments, such as auction rate securities, impairment is determined based on fair value and marketability of these investments. The valuation models we used to estimate fair value included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows, discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity. For nonmarketable equity securities, the impairment analysis requires the identification of events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment, including revenue and earnings trends, overall business prospects, dilution of valuation due to new financing, limited capital resources, limited prospects of receiving additional financing, limited prospects for liquidity of the related securities and general market conditions in the investees' industry.
Other-than-temporary Impairment
      Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first out basis. We write down inventory and record purchase commitment liabilities for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Inventories
      Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. The land at our Sunnyvale, California headquarters site and at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, is not depreciated. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease. Buildings and building improvements are amortized over the estimated lives of the assets, which range from 10 to 40 years. Construction in progress will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets when they are ready for their intended use.
Property and Equipment
     We review the carrying values of long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the asset.
     Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Acquisition-related intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic lives of five years for patents, four to five years for existing technology, 18 months to eight years for customer relationships and two to seven years for trademarks and tradenames as we believe this method would most closely reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets will be consumed.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets 
     In accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", ("SFAS No. 142") goodwill is measured and tested on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first
 
step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. We have one reporting unit, the fair value of which is determined to equal our market capitalization as determined through quoted market prices. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists, and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill an impairment exists and is recorded. We have not been required to perform this second step of the process since its adoption of SFAS No. 142 because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the net book value at every measurement date.
     We account for long-lived assets, including other purchased intangible assets acquired in business combinations, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "", ("SFAS No. 144"), which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment, such as reductions in demand, lower projections of profitability, significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets, or significant negative industry or economic trends are present. Reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired, based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows. If this comparison indicates that there is impairment, the impaired asset is written down to fair value, which is typically calculated using: (i) quoted market prices and/or (ii) discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in FASB Concepts Statement No. 7, "". Impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. We estimate regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows, the remaining economic life of the products and technologies, or both, may differ from those used to assess the recoverability of assets. In that event, impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long-lived assets may be required, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are made. Due to the recent negative economic trends, we tested our long-lived assets for impairment as of April 24, 2009 and determined they were not impaired, except for an impairment charge of intangibles of $14,917 in fiscal 2009 related to our decision to cease development and availability of a certain product.
Long-Lived Assets 
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements
      We apply the provisions of Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, and related interpretations to our product sales, both hardware and software, because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware. We recognize revenue when:
Revenue Recognition
"Software Revenue Recognition,"
     Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered software-related elements: software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance, and storage review services. Our software entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell technical consulting services separately from any of our other revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation services is recognized at the time of delivery and any remaining costs are accrued, as the remaining undelivered services are considered to be inconsequential and perfunctory. For arrangements with
 
multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements ("the residual method").
     For our undelivered software-related elements, we apply the provisions of SOP No. 97-2 and determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE"), which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately either alone, in the case of software entitlements and maintenance, or as a bundled element which always includes software entitlements and maintenance and premium hardware maintenance, and may also include storage review services. To determine the fair value of these elements, we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements, paragraph 12 of SOP No. 97-2 would require that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered.
     For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations, once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value with the remainder allocated to other service revenues.
     We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required.
     We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of our accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, was $3,068, and $2,439, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.
      Deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts related to software entitlements and maintenance, service contracts and other service described in revenue recognition above.
Deferred Revenues
      The costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Because we believe our current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, which occurs upon the completion of a working model, no costs have been capitalized for any of the periods presented. In accordance with SOP No. 98-1, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design, and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed and management authorizes and commits to funding the project. Projects where expected future economic benefits are less than probable are not capitalized. Internally developed software costs include the cost of software tools and licenses used in the development of our systems, as well as consulting costs. Completed projects are transferred to property and equipment at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, generally three years. We did not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007.
Software Development Costs

"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use,"
      Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are provided for temporary differences that will result in future tax deductions or income in future periods, as well as the future benefit of tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance reduces tax assets to their estimated realizable value.
Income Taxes
 
     Determining the liability for uncertain tax positions requires us to make significant estimates and judgments as to whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due based on potential tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Our estimates are based on the outcomes of previous audits, as well as the precedents set in cases in which others have taken similar tax positions to those taken by us. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such a determination.
     Effective April 28, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, FIN No. 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to file or not to file a return in a particular jurisdiction). FIN No. 48 is applicable to all uncertain tax positions for taxes accounted for under SFAS No. 109, and substantially changes the applicable accounting model. There was no cumulative effect from the adoption of FIN No. 48. As a result of the implementation of FIN No. 48, we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. See "Note 6, Income Taxes," for further discussion.

      For subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, gains and losses resulting from translation of these foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are recorded within stockholders' equity and comprehensive income as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, gains and losses resulting from the process of remeasuring foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in other income (expenses), net.
Foreign Currency Translation
      We follow SFAS No. 133, as amended. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings. If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or recognized within stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately. For all periods presented, realized gains and losses on the ineffective portion of our hedges were not material.
Derivative Instruments
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
     As a result of our significant international operations, we are subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates. We use derivative financial instruments, principally currency forward contracts and currency options, to attempt to minimize the impact of exchange rate movements on our balance sheet and operating results. Factors that could have an impact on the effectiveness of our hedging program include the accuracy of forecasts and the volatility of foreign currency markets. These programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange movements. The maturities of these instruments are generally less than one year.
     Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments.
      Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, excluding common shares subject to repurchase for that period. Diluted net income per share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential shares that were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of incremental common shares subject to repurchase and common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"), warrants, and restricted stock awards.
Net Income per Share
     Certain awards outstanding, representing 61,050, 39,302, and 22,827 shares of common stock, have been excluded from the diluted net income per share calculations for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive as these options' exercise prices were above the average market prices in such periods. Diluted shares outstanding do not include any effect resulting from the conversion of our Notes issued in June 2008, warrants and ESPP shares as their impact would be anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
 
     As of April 24, 2009, we have repurchased 104,325 shares of our common stock under various stock repurchase programs since inception of the repurchase programs in May 2003. Such repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and our outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share have been reduced by the weighted number of repurchased shares.
     The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:
      We account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, -("SFAS No. 123R"), which requires us to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payments awards, including employee stock options, restricted stock units and rights to purchase shares under our ESPP, based on their estimated fair value, and to recognize the costs in our financial statements over the employees' requisite service period. Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $140,754, $147,964 and $163,033, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
"Share
Based Payment"
     The fair value of employee restricted stock units is equal to the market value of our common stock on the date the award is granted. Calculating the fair value of employee stock options and the rights to purchase shares under the ESPP requires estimates and significant judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these awards, consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and is not remeasured as a result of subsequent stock price fluctuations. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of options, the expected price volatility of the stock underlying such options and forfeiture rate. Our expected term assumption is based primarily on historical exercise and post-vesting forfeiture experience. Our stock price volatility assumption is based on an implied volatility of call options and dealer quotes on call options, generally having a term of greater than twelve months. Changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of our stock-based awards, the related stock-based compensation expense and, consequently, our results of operations. Likewise, the shortening of the contractual life of our options could change the estimated exercise behavior in a manner other than currently expected.
     In addition, SFAS 123R requires that we estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on historical experience. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after April 28, 2006 is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in our financial statements. The expense we recognize in future periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the current period and/or our forecasts.
 
      Supplemental cash flows and noncash investing and financing activities are as follows:
Statements of Cash Flows
      In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB No. 28-1, ("FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB No. 28-1"). FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB No. 28-1 require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for annual and interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies. FSP FAS No. 107-1 and APB No. 28-1 are effective in reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and are required to be adopted by us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect the adoption of this FSP to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
"Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments"
     In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 115-2 and FAS No. 124-2, "" ("FSP FAS No. 115-2 and No. 124-2"). FSP FAS No. 115-2 and No. 124-2 amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities. Under FSP FAS No. 115-2 and No. 124-2, the pre-existing "intent and ability" trigger was modified such that an other-than-temporary impairment is now triggered when there is intent to sell the security, it is more likely than not that the security will be required to be sold before recovery in value, or the security is not expected to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Credit related losses on debt securities will be considered an other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings, and any other losses due to a decline in fair value relative to the amortized cost deemed not to be other-than-temporary will be recorded in other comprehensive income. FSP FAS No. 115-2 and No. 124-2 are effective in reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and are required to be adopted by our beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FSP FAS No. 115-2 and No. 124-2 will have on our consolidated financial statements.
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than Temporary Investments
     In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-4, ("FSP FAS No. 157-4"), which provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities under SFAS 157 , in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains the determination of an exit price. If we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities, quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FAS No. 157-4 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
"Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly"

     In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF No. 99-20-1, " ("FSP EITF No. 99-20-1"). FSP EITF No. 99-20-1 amends the impairment guidance under EITF 99-20 to be consistent with guidance under FASB No. 115. FSP EITF No. 99-20-1 removes the reference to market participants when a company determines impairment of a security under the expected future cash flows. FSP EITF No. 99-20-1 requires the company to recognize other-than temporary impairment as a realized loss through earnings when it is probable that there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected. The company must also consider all available information when developing the estimate of future cash flows. This FSP was effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2008. The adoption of FSP EITF No. 99-20-1 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
"Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20
     In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-3, ("FSP No. 157-3"). FSP No. 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which we adopted as of July 26, 2008, in situations where the market is not active. We have considered the guidance provided by FSP No. 157-3 in our determination of estimated fair values as of April 24, 2009, and the impact was not material.

     In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 07-5, ("EITF No. 07-5"). EITF No. 07-5 provides guidance on determining whether an equity-linked financial instrument, or embedded feature, is indexed to an entity's own stock. EITF No. 07-5 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not believe that the adoption EITF No. 07-5 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations.
"Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity's Own Stock"
     In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, ("SFAS No. 162"). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This standard was effective beginning November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 162 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
"The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles"
     In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3, ("FSP No. 142-3"). FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, "". The intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption FSP No. 142-3 may impact any intangibles the Company acquires in future transactions.
"Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets"
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
     In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, ("SFAS No. 161"). SFAS No. 161 requires additional disclosures about the objectives of using derivative instruments, the method by which the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No. 133 and its related interpretations, and the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items on financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 also requires disclosure of the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. This statement was effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Since SFAS No. 161 only requires additional disclosure, the adoption of SFAS No. 161 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
"Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
     In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-1, ("FSP No. 157-1"), and FSP No. 157-2, ("FSP No. 157-2"). FSP No. 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP No. 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact that the application of SFAS 157 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities may have on our consolidated financial statements. Our significant nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that may be impacted by the adoption of FAS 157 include goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets and restructuring liabilities.

"Effective Date of FASB Statement 157"
     In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), ("SFAS No. 141(R)"). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value. SFAS No. 141(R) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R) at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning April 25, 2009. The impact that SFAS 141R has on our consolidated financial

position, results of operations and cash flows will be dependent on the number and size of business combinations that we consummate subsequent to the adoption of the standard, as well as the valuation and allocation of the net assets acquired.
     In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, ("SFAS No. 160"). SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. This new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 160 at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2010, which begins on April 25, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material impact on our financial position or result of operations.

Short-Term and Long-Term Investments
     The following is a summary of investments at April 24, 2009:
 
     The following is a summary of investments at April 25, 2008:
 
     On August 13, 2007, we sold 360 shares of common stock of Blue Coat Systems, Inc. ("Blue Coat") and received net proceeds of $18,256 and recorded a $13,619 realized gain. These shares of common stock in Blue Coat were received in connection with the sale of certain assets of NetCache to Blue Coat on September 11, 2006, as described in Note 11.
     We record net unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities which are determined to be temporary in other comprehensive income (loss). The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair values of our investments, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at April 24, 2009:
     The following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair values of our investments, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at April 25, 2008:
     The unrealized losses on our investments in corporate bonds, U.S. government agency bonds and corporate securities were caused by market value declines as a result of the recent economic environment, as well as fluctuations in market interest rates. We believe that we will be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due to us at maturity given the high credit quality of these investments. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in market conditions and not credit quality, and because we have the ability and intent to hold those investments until a recovery of par value, we do not consider these investments to be other-than temporarily impaired at April 24, 2009.
 
     Our investments include direct and indirect investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. ("Lehman Brothers") securities. As of April 24, 2009, our short-term investments include corporate bonds issued by Lehman Brothers, while our long-term investments include the Reserve Primary Fund ("Primary Fund"), which held Lehman Brothers investments. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $21,129 in fiscal 2009 related to Lehman Brothers corporate bonds and the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments.
     Our long-term investments also include auction rate securities ("ARS") with a fair value of $66,537 and $72,702 at April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, respectively. Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. These ARS are securities with long-term nominal maturities which, in accordance with our investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our investments in auction rate securities from short-term investments to long-term investments as our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months is uncertain. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately $7,037 as of April 24, 2009, partially offset by $296 in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). During fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2,122 due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades.

4. Convertible Notes and Credit Facilities
     
1.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2013
      On June 10, 2008, we issued $1,265,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (the "Notes") to initial purchasers who resold the Notes to qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers' issue costs and offering expenses of $26,581, were $1,238,419.
Principal Amount
     In accordance with FSP APB No. 14-1 (see Note 2), we allocated the initial proceeds of the Notes between a liability (debt) and an equity component based on the fair value of the debt component as of the issuance date. The initial debt component of the Notes was valued at $1,016,962, based on the contractual cash flows discounted at an appropriate comparable market non-convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance of 6.31%, with the equity component representing the residual amount of the proceeds of $248,038, which was recorded as a debt discount. Issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the relative initial carrying amounts of the debt and equity components. As a result, $5,212 of the issuance costs were allocated to the equity component of the Notes, and $21,369 of the issuance costs remained classified as long-term other assets. The debt discount and the issuance costs allocated to the debt component are amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method.
 
     The following table reflects the carrying value of our convertible debt as of April 24, 2009:
     The following table presents the amount of interest cost recognized relating to both the contractual interest coupon and the amortization of the discount and issuance costs:
     The remaining debt discount and issuance cost of $210,283 and $18,135, respectively, as of April 24, 2009 will be amortized over the expected remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately 4.1 years.
     The Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of NetApp. Coupon interest is payable in cash at a rate of 1.75% per annum.
Ranking and Interest 
     The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013 unless repurchased or converted earlier in accordance with their terms prior to such date.
Maturity 
     The Notes are not redeemable by us prior to the maturity date, but the holders may require us to repurchase the Notes following a "fundamental change" (as defined in the Indenture). A fundamental change will be deemed to have occurred upon a change of control, liquidation or a termination of trading. Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a fundamental change will, under certain circumstances, be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date.
Redemption
     Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes on or after March 1, 2013 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion, we will satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering cash and shares of our common stock, if any, based on a daily settlement amount. Prior to March 1, 2013, holders of the Notes may convert their Notes, under any of the following conditions:
Conversion 
     The Notes are convertible into the right to receive cash in an amount up to the principal amount and shares of our common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, if any, at an initial conversion rate of 31.4006 shares of common stock per one thousand principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment as described in the indenture governing the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of $31.85 per share. As of period end, the if-converted value does not exceed the principal amount.
 
     
Note Hedges and Warrants
     Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions (the "Note Hedges"), which are designed to mitigate potential dilution from the conversion of the Notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock at the time of exercise is greater than $31.85 per share, subject to adjustments. The Note Hedges generally cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the net shares of our common stock that would be deliverable to converting Noteholders in the event of a conversion of the Notes. The Note Hedges expire at the earlier of (i) the last day on which any Notes remain outstanding and (ii) the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes. We also entered into separate warrant transactions whereby we sold to the same financial institutions warrants (the "Warrants") to acquire, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, 39,700 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $41.28 per share, subject to adjustment, on a series of days commencing on September 3, 2013. Upon exercise of the Warrants, we have the option to deliver cash or shares of our common stock equal to the difference between the then market price and the strike price of the Warrants. As of April 24, 2009, we had not received any shares related to the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares related to the Warrants.
     If the market value per share of our common stock at the time of conversion of the Notes is above the strike price of the Note Hedges, the Note Hedges will generally entitle us to receive net shares of our common stock (and cash for any fractional share amount) based on the excess of the then current market price of our common stock over the strike price of the Note Hedges, which is designed to offset any shares that we may have to deliver to the Noteholders. Additionally, at the time of exercise of the Warrants, if the market price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants, we will owe the option counterparties net shares of our common stock (and cash for any fractional share amount) or cash in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of our common stock over the strike price of the Warrants.
     The cost of the Note Hedges was $254,898 and has been accounted for as an equity transaction in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 00-19, (EITF No. 00- 19). We received proceeds of $163,059 related to the sale of the Warrants, which has also been classified as equity because the instruments meet all of the equity classification criteria within EITF No. 00-19.
"Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock"
     Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives, Inc. ("Lehman OTC") is the counterparty to 20% of our Note Hedges. The bankruptcy filing by Lehman OTC on October 3, 2008 constituted an "event of default" under the hedge transaction that could, at our option, lead to termination under the hedge transaction to the extent we provide notice to the counterparty under such transaction. We have not terminated the Note Hedge transaction with Lehman OTC, and will continue to carefully monitor the developments impacting Lehman OTC. The "event of default" is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we could incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction originally held with Lehman OTC if we elect to do so. If we do not elect to replace this hedge transaction, then we would be subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes, if on the date of conversion the per-share market price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of $31.85.
     The terms of the Notes, the rights of the holders of the Notes and other counterparties to Note Hedges and Warrants were not affected by the bankruptcy filings of Lehman OTC.
     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 128, the Notes will have no impact on diluted earnings per share unless the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price (initially $31.85 per share) because the principal amount of the Notes will be settled in cash upon conversion. The Note Hedges are not included for purposes of calculating earnings per share for fiscal 2009, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion of the Notes, the Note Hedges are designed to neutralize the dilutive effect of the Notes when the stock price is above $31.85 per share. Also, in accordance with SFAS No. 128, the Warrants will have no impact on earnings per share until our common stock share price exceeds $41.28. Prior to conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Note Hedges, we will include the effect of additional shares that may be issued if our common stock price exceeds the conversion price, using the treasury stock method.

Unsecured Credit Agreement
     On November 2, 2007, we entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement (the "Unsecured Credit Agreement") with certain lenders and BNP Paribas ("BNP"), as syndication agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association ("JPMorgan"), as administrative agent. The Unsecured Credit Agreement provides for a revolving unsecured credit facility that is comprised of commitments from various lenders who agree to make revolving loans and swingline loans and issue letters of credit of up to an aggregate amount of $250,000 with a term of five years. Revolving loans may be, at our option, Alternative Base Rate borrowings or
 
Eurodollar borrowings. Interest on Eurodollar borrowings accrues at a floating rate based on LIBOR for the interest period specified by us plus a spread based on our leverage ratio. Interest on Alternative Base Rate borrowings, swingline loans, and letters of credit accrues at a rate based on the Prime Rate in effect on such day. The proceeds of the loans may be used for our general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases and working capital needs. As of April 24, 2009, no amount was outstanding under this facility. The amounts allocated under the Unsecured Credit Agreement to support certain of our outstanding letters of credit amounted to $638 as of April 24, 2009. As of April 24, 2009, we were in compliance with all covenants as required by the Unsecured Credit Agreement.
     
Secured Credit Agreement
     On October 5, 2007, we entered into a secured credit agreement (the "Secured Credit Agreement"). The Secured Credit Agreement provided for a revolving secured credit facility of up to $250,000 with a term of five years. As of April 25, 2008, the outstanding balance on the Secured Credit Agreement was $172,600, which was recorded as Revolving Credit Facilities in the consolidated balance sheets, and was secured with $242,613 of long-term restricted investments pledged in connection with this agreement. During fiscal 2009, we terminated the Secured Credit Agreement. No borrowings were outstanding at the time of termination and no penalties resulted from the early termination.
     
Loan Agreement
     On March 31, 2006, NetApp Global LTD. ("Global"), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement"). The Loan Agreement provided for an aggregate borrowings of $300,000. The Loan Agreement was fully repaid as of April 25, 2008.
     
Foreign Exchange Facilities
     We also have foreign exchange facilities used for hedging arrangements with several banks that allow us to enter into foreign exchange contracts of up to $600,000, of which $317,210 was available at April 24, 2009.
5. Stock-Based Compensation, Equity Incentive Programs and Stockholders' Equity
     Stock-based compensation expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:
     The following table summarizes stock-based compensation associated with each type of award:
 
     
Valuation Assumptions
     We estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes model on the date of the grant. Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes valuation model were as follows:
 
     We estimate our forfeiture rates based on historical termination behavior and recognize compensation expense only for those equity awards expected to vest.
     
Equity Incentive Programs
     
Stock Incentive Plans
      The 1995 Stock Incentive Plan ("the 1995 Plan") expired on August 31, 2008, and no further grants may be made from the plan.
The 1995 Plan
     Options granted under the 1995 Plan generally vested at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following 36 months. Options expired as determined by the Board of Directors, but not more than 10 years after the date of grant. The 1999 Plan supplements the 1995 Plan.
      In April 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Special Nonofficer Stock Option Plan ("the Nonofficer Plan") which provides for the grant of options and the issuance of common stock under terms substantially the same as those provided under the 1995 Plan, except that the Nonofficer Plan allows only for the issuance of nonqualified options to nonofficer employees. The Nonofficer Plan expired on December 31, 2007, and no further grants may be made from the plan.
The Nonofficer Plan
      As amended through April 24, 2009, the 1999 Stock Option Plan ("the 1999 Plan") comprises five separate equity incentive programs: (i) the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which options may be granted to eligible individuals during the service period at a fixed price per share; (ii) the Stock Appreciation Rights Program under which eligible persons may be granted stock appreciation rights that allow individuals to receive the appreciation in Fair Market Value of the shares; (iii) the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible individuals may be issued shares of Common Stock directly; (iv) the Performance Share and Performance Unit Program (also known as restricted stock units or RSUs) under which eligible persons may be granted performance shares and performance units which result in payment to the participant only if performance goals or other vesting criteria are achieved; and (v) the Automatic Option Grant Program under which nonemployee board members automatically receive option grants at designated intervals over their period of board service.
The 1999 Plan
     Under the 1999 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant to employees, nonemployee directors, and consultants and other independent advisors options to purchase shares of our common stock during their period of service with us. The exercise price for an incentive stock option and a nonstatutory option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. Options granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest over a four-year period. Options granted prior to April 29, 2006, have a term of no more than 10 years after the date of grant and those granted after April 29, 2006 have a term of no more than seven years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events. The 1999 Plan prohibits the repricing of any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right after it has been granted or to cancel any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right and immediately replace it with a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price unless approved by
 
stockholders. Restricted stock units granted under the 1999 Plan generally vest over a four-year period with 25% of the units vesting on each annual anniversary of the grant date. The 1999 Plan limits the percentage of Stock Issuance and Performance Shares or Performance Units that may be granted under the Plan to 30% of the shares reserved; limits the value of performance units a participant may receive during any calendar year to $2,000. The 1999 Plan expires on August 2019.
      In fiscal 2008, we assumed a stock incentive plan in connection with our acquisition of Onaro (see Note 11). Under the terms of the merger agreement, options and restricted stock units to purchase 1,000 shares were exchanged at certain exchange ratios. The options granted under this plan generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following 36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date.
Acquisition Plans
     In fiscal 2007, we assumed two stock incentive plans in connection with our acquisition of Topio (see Note 11.) Under the terms of the merger agreement, options and restricted stock units to purchase 858 shares were exchanged at certain exchange ratios. The options granted under these plans generally vest at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and then ratably over the following 36 months. The restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 50% on the first and second annual anniversaries of the vesting commencement date.
     In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, 1999 Plan was amended to increase the share reserved by an additional 6,600, 7,200, and 10,900 shares for issuance under the plan, respectively. As of April 24, 2009, 17,822 shares were available for grant under our equity incentive plans.
 
     A summary of the combined activity under our stock option plans and agreements is as follows:
     The intrinsic value of stock options represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options and the market price of our stock on that day for all in-the-money options. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $7.28, $10.13 and $12.83, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $30,325, $83,129 and $267,165, respectively. We received $41,083, $66,614, and $178,241 from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total fair value of options vested during fiscal 2009 was $179,805.
     The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding under all option plans as of April 24, 2009:
 
     The following table summarizes activity related to our restricted stock units:
     There was $256,745 of total unrecognized compensation expense as of April 24, 2009 related to options and restricted stock units. The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining period of 2.5 years. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, total income tax benefit associated with employee stock transactions and recognized in the statement of stockholders equity was $45,445, $48,195 and $175,036, respectively.
      On April 21, 2009, our stockholders approved a stock option exchange program pursuant to which eligible employees would be able to exchange some or all of their outstanding options with an exercise price greater or equal to $22.00 per share that were granted before June 20, 2008, whether vested or unvested, for new RSUs. The number of RSUs that will be granted in exchange for the options will depend on the exercise price of the options exchanged. The vesting schedule of the RSUs will be determined on a grant-by-grant basis and will depend on the extent to which the options surrendered in exchange for such RSUs have vested at the time of such exchange and, for surrendered options that are fully vested, the exercise price. Vesting of the RSUs will be conditioned upon continued service with us through each applicable vesting date. On May 22, 2009, we commenced the option exchange program, which unless extended by us, will expire on June 19, 2009. For more information, please see our tender offer statement on Schedule TO, as filed with the SEC on May 22, 2009, as may be amended from time to time.
Stock Option Exchange Program
      Under the 1999 Stock Issuance Program, certain eligible persons may be issued shares of common stock directly. No restricted stock award was issued to employees during fiscal 2009 and 2008. During fiscal 2007, 125 shares of restricted stock awards were issued to certain employees. At April 24, 2009, 5,446 shares were available for future issuances under this program.
Stock Issuance Program
     The following table summarizes activity related to our restricted stock awards:
 
     Although nonvested shares are legally issued, they are considered contingently returnable shares subject to repurchase by the Company when employees terminate their employment. The total fair value of shares vested during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $1,987, $1,632, and $3,135, respectively. There was $2,530 of total unrecognized compensation expense as of April 24, 2009 related to restricted stock awards. The unrecognized compensation expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average remaining period of 1.3 years.
      Under the ESPP, employees are entitled to purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the fair market value at certain specified dates over a two-year period. In fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the plan was amended to increase the share reserved by an additional 2,900, 1,600 and 1,600 shares of common stock, respectively. The weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted under the ESPP during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $6.17, $7.44, and $7.94, respectively. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, 3,333, 2,057, and 1,632 shares, respectively, were issued under the ESPP at a weighted average price of $14.96, $23.38, and $22.78 respectively. Of the 23,500 shares authorized to be issued under this plan, 3,376 shares were available for issuance at April 24, 2009.

      Since the inception of the stock repurchase program on May 13, 2003 through April 24, 2009, we have purchased a total of 104,325 shares of our common stock at an average price of $28.06 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $2,927,376. As of April 24, 2009, our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $4,023,639 of common stock under the various stock repurchase programs, and $1,096,262 remains available under these authorizations. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
Stock Repurchase Program
     During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 16,960 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $399,981, or a weighted average price of $23.58 per share. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 32,772 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $903,704, or a weighted average price of $27.58 per share. The repurchases were recorded as treasury stock and resulted in a reduction of stockholders' equity.
6. Income Taxes
     Income before income taxes is as follows:
     The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following:
 
     The provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
     The income tax benefits associated with dispositions from employee stock transactions of $45,445, $48,195, and $175,036, respectively, for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, were recognized as additional paid-in capital.
     The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
     Current net deferred tax assets are $207,050 and $127,197 as of fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Noncurrent net deferred tax assets for fiscal 2009 and 2008 are $177,941 and $132,828, respectively, and are included in Long Term Deferred Taxes and Other Assets within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The valuation allowance decreased by $528 in fiscal 2009 primarily due to a change in the blended state tax rates.
     As discussed in Note 2, effective April 28, 2007, we adopted FIN No. 48, , which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, . This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,"
"Accounting for Income Taxes"
 
     A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
     Out of the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits at April 24, 2009, $93,136 , if recognized, would affect our provision for income taxes.
     We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. During the fiscal years ended 2005 through 2009, we recognized total accrued interest and penalties of approximately $170 and have included this accrual in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
     We are subject to taxation in the United States, various states, and several foreign jurisdictions.
     The tax years that remain subject to examination for our major tax jurisdictions are shown below:
Tax Years Subject to Examination for Major Tax Jurisdictions at April 24, 2009
     In addition, we are effectively subject to federal tax examination adjustments for tax years ended on or after fiscal year 2000, in that we have net operating loss carryforwards from these years that could be subject to adjustment, if and when utilized.
     We are currently undergoing federal income tax audits in the United States for the fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and in several foreign tax jurisdictions. The rights to some of our intellectual property ("IP") are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP in a qualified cost sharing arrangement. Recently, several other U.S. companies have had their foreign IP arrangements challenged as part of IRS examinations, which have resulted in material proposed assessments and/or pending litigation. During fiscal 2009, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustments from the IRS in connection with the tax audit of our fiscal year 2003 and 2004 tax returns. We recently filed a protest with the IRS in response to the Notices of Proposed Adjustment. The Notices of Proposed Adjustment focus primarily on issues of the timing and the amount of income recognized and deductions taken during the audit years and on the level of cost allocations made to foreign operations during the audit years. At this time we cannot make a determination as to the amount our unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced as a result of the audit. We do not expect resolution of our IRS audit or other audits within significant foreign or state jurisdictions over the next 12 months.
     As mentioned above, the rights to some of our IP are owned by certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and payments are made between foreign and U.S. tax jurisdictions relating to the use of this IP and a qualified cost sharing arrangement. Effective September 27, 2007, the IRS's Large and Mid-Sized Business Division ("LMSB") released a Coordinated Issues Paper ("CIP") with respect to qualified cost sharing arrangements ("CSAs"). Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel concerning methods that may be applied to evaluate the arm's length charge (buy-in payment) for internally developed (pre-existing) as well as acquisition-related intangible property that is made available to a qualified CSA. On March 20, 2008, the IRS's LMSB also released a CIP with respect to the cost sharing of stock based compensation. Specifically, this CIP provides guidance to IRS personnel concerning stock based compensation related to a CSA by providing that the parties to a CSA will share all costs related to intangible development of the
 
covered intangibles, including but not limited to, salaries, bonuses, and other payroll costs and benefits. Taxpayers should include all forms of compensation in the cost pool, including those costs related to stock-based compensation.
     Additionally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on May 27, 2009 held in Xilinx Inc. v. Commissioner that stock-based compensation must be included in the research and development cost base of companies that have entered into a cost sharing arrangement and must, therefore, be allocated among the participants based on anticipated benefits. The Court's reversal of the prior U.S. Tax Court decision will change our estimate of tax benefits that were required to be recognized in connection with our adoption of FIN 48 at the beginning of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the Xilinx case on our provision for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 but expect any final adjustment will be limited to a reduction of our unrecognized tax attributes.
     Pursuant to the requirements of Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R, we do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. Footnote 82 is applied on a prospective basis. The tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards, and their corresponding valuation allowance excluded under Footnote 82 for the years ended April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008 are $278,890 and $245,130, respectively, which will result in additional paid in capital if and when realized as a reduction in taxes otherwise paid.
     As of our fiscal years ended April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, the amount of accumulated unremitted earnings from our foreign subsidiaries under APB No. 23 is approximately $873,100 and $677,200, respectively.
     During fiscal 2006, our Netherlands subsidiary received a favorable tax ruling from the Netherlands tax authorities effective May 1, 2005. This ruling replaced a previous Netherlands tax ruling that was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. This ruling results in both a lower level of earnings subject to tax in the Netherlands and an extension of the expiration date to April 30, 2010.
     Network Appliance Systems India Pvt. Ltd. received a tax holiday from the Indian tax authorities attributed to its call center and research and development activities effective June 6, 2003. These activities qualify under the Software Technology Park of India ("STPI") incentive for the development and manufacture of computer software and information technology enabled services. Under this tax holiday, net income derived from call center and research and development activities is exempt from Indian taxation. This tax holiday is set to expire on March 31, 2010. Notwithstanding qualification for this tax holiday, new general minimum tax rules in India effective for us as of fiscal 2009 override the full tax exemption. For fiscal 2009, we were subject to a minimum tax on this income in India at a rate of 11.33%.
     As of April 24, 2009, our Netherlands subsidiary had a conditional royalty expense carryforward of $62,624 that may become available for offset against future Netherlands income. The carryforward may not, however, be used to offset income under the new Netherlands tax ruling expiring April 30, 2010. The carryforward does not have an expiration date. We have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the carryforward based upon our belief that we will not be able to utilize this attribute. In the event we are able to utilize this attribute, the tax benefit of the carryforward will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders' equity of $9,219 and as a reduction to the income tax provision of $6,750.
     As of April 24, 2009, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $538,372 and $142,414, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2020. State net operating losses of $6,074 will expire in fiscal years 2010 through 2012; $10,640 will expire in fiscal year 2013 while the remaining $125,700 will expire in fiscal years 2014 through 2029.
     As of April 24, 2009, we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $81,635 and $81,220, respectively, available to offset future income tax liabilities. Federal tax credit carryforwards of $40,077 will begin to expire in fiscal years 2010 through 2021, while the remaining $41,558 will expire in fiscal years beginning 2022. State tax credits of $41 will expire in fiscal years 2010 through 2013, while the remaining $81,179 is available indefinitely to reduce cash taxes otherwise payable. As discussed above, most of the net operating loss and tax credit carryovers, if realized, will be recognized as additional paid in capital in that they are employee stock option tax attributes.
     During fiscal 2004, as part of our acquisition of Spinnaker, we acquired approximately $52,000 and $12,000 of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, and $2,700 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred tax assets upon acquisition. We also established a valuation allowance of $2,400 against a portion of the state net operating loss carryforwards of Spinnaker, which if utilized, will be treated as a reduction of income tax expense.
 
     During fiscal 2006, as part of our acquisition of Decru, we acquired approximately $32,100 of federal net operating losses and $1,100 of federal tax credits that were realized as deferred tax assets upon acquisition. We also established valuation reserves of $1,200 and $1,200 against all of Decru's state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards, respectively, that existed as of the acquisition date. If utilized, these attributes will be treated as a reduction of income tax expense.
7. Segment, Geographic, and Significant Customer Information
     Under SFAS No. 131, we operate in one reportable industry segment: the design, manufacturing, marketing, and technical support of high-performance networked storage solutions. We market our products in the U.S. and in foreign countries through our sales personnel and our subsidiaries. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer are considered our Chief Operating Decision Makers ("CODMs"), as defined by SFAS No. 131. The CODMs evaluates resource allocation decisions and operational performance based upon revenue by geographic regions. Under SFAS No. 131, we have one reportable segment, as our three geographic operating segments can be aggregated into one reportable segment as they have similar operating characteristics. For fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded revenue from customers throughout the U.S. and Canada, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Asia Pacific.
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,"
     The following table presents net revenues for the years ended April 24, 2009, April 25, 2008, and April 27, 2007, by geographic area and long-lived assets as of April 24, 2009, and April 25, 2008, by geographic area.
     Net revenues above are attributed to geographic area based on customers' shipment locations.
     International sales include export sales primarily to the United Kingdom, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia. Germany accounted for 10.5% or more of net revenues in fiscal 2009. No single foreign country accounted for 10% or more of net revenues in fiscal 2008 and 2007.
     During fiscal 2009, two U.S. distributors accounted for approximately 10.6% and 10.5% of our net revenues, respectively. No customer accounted for ten percent of our net revenues during fiscal 2008 and 2007.
8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
     Effective April 26, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, SFAS No. 157, except as it applies to the non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities subject to Financial Staff Position SFAS No. 157-2.
"Fair Value Measurements" (
)
     SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which these assets and liabilities would be transacted.
 
     In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 157-3 ("FSP No. 157-3"). FSP No. 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, which we adopted as of July 26, 2008, in situations where the market is not active. The adoption of FSP No. 157-3 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
"Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active"
     In January 2009, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") No. 99-20-1, FSP EITF No. 99-20-1 requires us to recognize other-than temporary impairments as a realized loss through earnings when it is probable that there has been an adverse change in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously projected. We adopted FSP No. EITF 99-20-1 as of January 24, 2009. Adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
"Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue 99-20."
     
Fair Value Hierarchy:
     SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value from market based assumptions to entity specific assumptions is as follows:
     observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and readily accessible by us at the reporting date;
Level 1:
     inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets; and
Level 2:
     unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions.
Level 3:
     We consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis, and view an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers. Where appropriate our own or the counterparty's non-performance risk is considered in determining the fair values of liabilities and assets, respectively.
     The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with SFAS No. 157 as of April 24, 2009:
 
     Reported as:
 
     Our marketable securities include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, corporate securities, auction rate securities, and money market funds, including the Primary Fund and certificates of deposit. Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The remaining balance of cash equivalents consists primarily of certain money market funds, for which the carrying amounts is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
     We classify investments within Level 1 if quoted prices are available in active markets. Level 1 investments generally include U.S. Treasury notes, trading securities with quoted prices on active markets, and money market funds, with the exception of the Primary Fund, which is classified in Level 3.
     We classify items in Level 2 if the investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. These investments include: corporate bonds, corporate securities, U.S. government agency bonds, certificates of deposit, and foreign currency contracts. Investments are held by a custodian who obtains investment prices from a third party pricing provider that uses standard inputs to models which vary by asset class. We corroborate the prices obtained from the pricing service against other independent sources and, as of April 24, 2009, have not found it necessary to make any adjustments to the prices obtained. Included in Level 2 are corporate bonds issued by Lehman Brothers.
     Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are also classified within Level 2. We determine the fair value of these instruments by considering the estimated amount we would pay or receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date. We use observable inputs, including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities. Foreign currency contracts consist of forward foreign exchange contracts for primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Our foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments in active markets. In fiscal 2009, net losses generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $25,905, which were offset by gains on the related derivative instruments of $20,872. In fiscal 2008, net gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $12,752, which were offset by losses on the related derivative instruments of $13,487. In fiscal 2007, net gains generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $5,180, which were offset by losses on the related derivative instruments of $2,829.
 
     We classify items in Level 3 if the investments are valued using a pricing model or based on unobservable inputs in the market. These investments include auction rate securities, the Primary Fund and cost method investments.
     The table below provides a reconciliation of our Level 3 financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for fiscal 2009.
     As of April 24, 2009, we have an investment in the Primary Fund, an AAA-rated money market fund at the time of purchase, with a par value of $60,928 and an estimated fair value of $51,630, which suspended redemptions in September 2008 and is in the process of liquidating its portfolio of investments. During fiscal 2009, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $9,298, which was our pro rata share of the Primary Fund's overall investment in Lehman Brothers' securities. All amounts invested in the Primary Fund are included in long-term investments given the lack of liquidity of the fund and the uncertainty as to the timing and the amount of the final distributions of the fund.
     The Primary Fund investments were classified as Level 3 due to lack of market data to determine fair value. We received total distributions of $546,344 in fiscal 2009 from the Primary Fund. Those proceeds have been invested in unrelated money market funds. Our remaining investment in the Primary Fund as of April 24, 2009 is $51,630.
     As of April 24, 2009, we had auction rate securities with a par value of $75,400 and an estimated fair value of $66,537. Substantially all of our ARS are backed by pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2,122, due to a decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately $7,037 as of April 24, 2009, partially offset by unrealized gains of $296, within other comprehensive income (loss). We estimated the fair value for each individual ARS using an income (discounted cash flow) approach which incorporates both observable and unobservable inputs to discount the expected future cash flows. Based on our ability to access our cash and other short-term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery of par value. We will continue to monitor our ARS investments in light of the current debt market environment and evaluate our accounting for these investments quarterly.
     At April 24, 2009, we held $3,969 of other investments consisting of a private equity fund and direct investments in technology companies. These investments are accounted for using the cost method under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 18, "" During fiscal 2009, we recorded $6,320 of impairment charges on certain of these investments and adjusted their carrying amount to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the value of those assets to be other-than-temporary. These cost method investments fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value, as the investments are in privately held technology entities without quoted market prices.
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.
     
Other Fair Value Disclosures
     In accordance with SFAS No. 107, "," we are required to disclose the fair value of our long-term debt at least annually or more frequently if the fair value has changed significantly. Our convertible notes and debt are carried at cost. The fair value of our debt also approximates its carrying value as of April 25, 2008 based upon inputs that are observable directly in active markets (Level 2). The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $1,143,244 at April 24, 2009, based upon quoted market information (Level 2).
Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
     In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides companies the option (the "Fair Value Option") to measure certain financial instruments and
"The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
 
other items at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the Fair Value Option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, although earlier adoption is permitted. Currently, we have elected not to adopt the Fair Value Option under this pronouncement.
     The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options contracts outstanding on April 24, 2009:
     The following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts and currency options contracts outstanding on April 25, 2008:
9. Derivatives and Hedging Activities
     We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. We also have in place a master netting arrangement to mitigate the credit risk of our counterparty and potentially to reduce our losses due to counterparty nonperformance. All contracts have a maturity of less than six months.
     In accordance with SFAS No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "", we recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value (i.e. gains or losses) of the derivatives are recorded as revenues or other income (expense), or as accumulated other comprehensive income ("OCI"). If the derivative is designated as a hedge, depending on the nature of the exposure being hedged, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged items through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized in earnings immediately.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
     Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below:
     We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related to certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged and the net amount is included in earnings. In fiscal 2009, net loss generated by hedged assets and liabilities totaled $25,905, which were offset by gains on the related derivative instruments of $20,872, which includes time value expense of $719 on cash flow revenue hedge contracts.
Balance Sheet.
 
     We use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in duration. The contracts are carried on the balance sheet at fair value, and the effective portion of the contracts' gains and losses is recorded as other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. If the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes probable that they will not occur, the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings. We measure the effectiveness of hedges of forecasted transactions on a monthly basis by comparing the fair values of the designated currency forward contracts with the fair values of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of the derivative hedging gain or loss as well as changes in the fair value of the derivative's time value (which are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness) is recognized in current period earnings. During fiscal 2009, no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings and the time value component in our cash flow hedges of $719 was recognized as a reduction to other income, (expenses), net.
Forecasted Transactions.
     Over the next twelve months, it is expected that $524 of derivative net losses recorded in other comprehensive income ("OCI") as of April 24, 2009 will be reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to sales revenue. The maximum length of time over which forecasted foreign denominated sales revenues are hedged is six months.
     As of April 24, 2009, we had the following outstanding currency forward contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted foreign denominated sales and our balance sheet monetary asset and liability exposures:
Cash Flow Hedges:
Balance Sheet contracts:
     We net derivative assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that master netting arrangements meet the requirements of FASB Interpretation No. 39, "
Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts ("Interpretation No. 39"), as amended by FASB Interpretation No. 41, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements."
     The fair value of derivative instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as of April 24, 2009 was as follows (in thousands):
 
     The effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended April 24, 2009 was as follows (in thousands):
 
     The effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedges on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended April 24, 2009 was as follows (in thousands):
 
10. Employee Benefit, Incentive Compensation Plans and Deferred Compensation
     We have established a 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan ("Savings Plan"). Employees meeting the eligibility requirements, as defined, may contribute specified percentages of their salaries. We contributed $13,568, $12,241, and $10,920 for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively to the Savings Plan.
     All employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the Incentive Compensation Plan ("Incentive Plan") provided that they meet certain requirements pursuant to the Incentive Plan. Incentive Plan contributions totaled $66,178, $56,632, and $56,722 in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.
     At April 24, 2009, we have marketable securities of $7,934 related to investments in debt and equity securities that are held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The total related deferred compensation liability was $7,934 at April 24, 2009, of which $953 was classified as other accrued liabilities and $6,981 was classified as other long-term obligations in our consolidated balance sheets.
11. Business Combinations and Divestitures
     We have acquired two companies over the last three fiscal years. The total purchase price paid for each of these companies is summarized below:
 
     In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the purchase price to the estimated tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price allocations are as follows:
     The historical operations of each of those entities were not significant and accordingly no pro forma information has been provided.
     
Acquisition of Onaro
     On January 28, 2008, we acquired Onaro, Inc. ("Onaro"), a privately-held company based in Boston, Massachusetts, that provided software solutions for enterprises to increase service quality, return on storage, and compliance by managing storage as a service. Goodwill of $79,211 was recorded in connection with our acquisition of Onaro. The acquisition gave our customers access to new storage service management and change management capabilities. It allowed us to help enterprise organizations increase data center and storage network efficiencies by proactively managing and optimizing storage service levels for availability and performance in dynamic data center environments, using our cost-effective and highly scalable modular storage systems.
     We plan to further develop and extend Onaro's service management software technologies and build upon the foundation that the Onaro's software provides. In addition, Onaro has an experienced and knowledgeable workforce and an existing infrastructure. These opportunities, along with the ability to leverage the Onaro workforce, were primary contributing factors to the establishment of the purchase price, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based on management estimates and assumptions, and other information compiled by management that utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
     The net deferred income tax liability of $11,709 recorded in connection with this acquisition is comprised of deferred tax assets of $2,893, primarily related to net operating losses incurred from inception through the acquisition date and a deferred tax liability of $14,602 related to acquired intangible assets.
     As of the acquisition date, no amounts were allocated to in-process research and development. In-process research and development is dependent on the status of new projects on the date the acquisition is consummated. Prior to the acquisition date, Onaro had released new versions of its software products. Accordingly, there were no substantive research and development projects in process on the date the acquisition was consummated.
     
Acquisition of Topio
     On December 7, 2006, we acquired Topio, Inc. ("Topio"), a privately-held company based in Santa Clara, California that developed and sold enterprise-class software for data replication and rapid recovery across the spectrum of locations, platforms and storage that support an enterprise. The acquisition will continue to expand our data protection portfolio and simplify the replication of data from other storage arrays to our storage systems.
     Goodwill of $114,700 was recorded in connection with our acquisition of Topio. The current and future potential of the Topio technology will enable us to expand our data protection portfolio and simplify the replication of data from other storage arrays to our storage systems. In addition, Topio has an experienced and knowledgeable workforce and an existing infrastructure. These opportunities, along with the ability to leverage the Topio workforce, were significant contributing factors to the establishment of the
 
purchase price, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management estimates and assumptions, and other information compiled by management that utilized established valuation techniques appropriate for the high-technology industry. Goodwill recorded as a result of this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
     The net deferred income tax liability of $5,150 recorded in connection with this acquisition is comprised of deferred tax assets of $7,644 primarily related to net operating losses incurred from inception through the acquisition date and a deferred tax liability of $12,794 related to acquired intangible assets.
     Because Topio had recently introduced its products as of the date of acquisition, no amount was allocated to in-process research and development.
     
Divestiture of NetCache
     On September 11, 2006, we completed the sale of certain assets of our NetCache product line to Blue Coat and agreed not to compete in the market served by NetCache for a period of no less than three years from and after September 11, 2006. We received $23,914 in cash and 360 shares of Blue Coat's common stock with a fair value of $4,637 as of September 11, 2006. In addition, we accrued $2,032 for costs expected to be incurred to fulfill our engineering and service contractual obligations. Because of these continuing obligations, the NetCache sale did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation. As a result of this divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $25,339 in our income from operations and a reduction of goodwill of $1,179. We recorded revenues of $57,421 from NetCache products for fiscal 2007. The contribution to operating income from these products was not significant.
12. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
     Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units is required to be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments, as defined by SFAS No. 131, "."
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"
Segment Reporting
     We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. During fiscal 2009, we experienced a decline in our stock price, resulting in a loss of market capitalization. However, we determined that no events or circumstances had occurred to indicate that an assessment was necessary, other than our required annual assessment. As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, there was no impairment of goodwill. We will continue to monitor conditions and changes in the global economy that could impact future operating results of our reporting units. If the businesses acquired fail to meet our expectations as set out at the time of acquisition or if the market capitalization of our stock trades at a depressed level for an extended period of time, we could incur significant impairment charges which could negatively impact our financial results. Goodwill activity is summarized as follows:
     In fiscal 2008, we acquired Onaro and recorded goodwill of $79,211 resulting from the allocation of the purchase price and decreased goodwill by $213 relating to escrow funds received from Topio purchase transaction. In fiscal 2009, we increased goodwill by $932 relating to the tax benefits associated with the subsequent exercise of previously vested assumed Spinnaker and Onaro options.
 
     The change in the net carrying amount of intangibles for the periods ended April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008 is as follows:
     Intangible assets balances are summarized as follows:
     Amortization expense for identified intangibles is summarized below:
     Our acquired patents are intended to enhance our technology base to build next-generation network-attached storage, storage area network, and fabric-attached storage systems for the benefit of our enterprise customers. The costs of such patents for use in research and development activities that have alternative future uses have been capitalized and amortized over an estimated useful life of five years as research and development expenses.
     Existing technology is amortized as cost of product revenue. Trademarks, tradenames, customer contracts and relationships are amortized as sales and marketing expenses. Covenants not to compete are amortized as general and administrative expenses.
     In December 2008, we decided to cease development and availability of our SnapMirror for Open Systems product. In connection with this decision, we recorded charges of $14,917 attributable to the impairment of existing technology and customer contracts/relationships related to our Topio acquisition.
     Based on the identified intangible assets recorded at April 24, 2009, the future amortization expense of identified intangibles for the next five fiscal years is as follows:
 
13. Restructuring and Other Charges
     
Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plans
     In February 2009, we announced our decision to execute a worldwide restructuring program, which included a reduction in workforce, the closing or downsizing of certain facilities, and the establishment of a plan to outsource certain internal activities. In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease the development and availability of our SnapMirror for Open Systems ("SMOS") product, which was originally acquired through our acquisition of Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this decision, we also announced the closure of our engineering facility in Haifa, Israel.
     These restructuring activities resulted in restructuring charges totaling $51,447 related to severance-related amounts and other charges attributable to the termination of approximately 450 regular positions, abandoned excess facilities charges relating to non-cancelable lease costs, which are net of expected sublease income; contract cancellation charges; and outplacement expenses, to support restructuring and fixed assets intangibles write-offs; as well as $2,959 of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives. In recording the facility lease restructuring reserve, we made certain estimates and assumptions related to the (i) time period over which the relevant buildings would remain vacant, (ii) sublease terms, and (iii) sublease rates.
     As of April 24, 2009, approximately $15,896 of the costs associated with these activities were unpaid. We expect that severance-related charges and other costs will be substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and the facilities-related lease payments to be substantially paid by the third quarter of fiscal 2013.
     
Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan
     As of April 24, 2009, we also have $1,265 remaining in facility restructuring reserves established as part of a restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. During fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring recoveries of $61 resulting from a change in the estimated operating expenses relating to this facility restructuring reserve. We expect to substantially fulfill the remaining contractual obligations related to this facility restructuring reserve by fiscal 2011.
     The following table summarizes the provisions, respective payments, and remaining accrued balance as of April 24, 2009 for charges incurred in fiscal year 2009, 2008 and 2007:
     Of the reserve balance at April 24, 2009, $14,665 was included in other accrued liabilities, and the remaining $2,496 was classified as other long-term obligations.
 
14. Commitments and Contingencies
     The following summarizes our commitments and contingencies at April 24, 2009, and the effect such obligations may have on our future periods:
 
 
     
Real Estate Leases
     We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with BNPPLC for approximately 564,274 square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. As of April 24, 2009, we have a leasing arrangement ("Leasing Arrangements 1") which requires us to lease land in Sunnyvale to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 190,000 square feet of space costing up to $48,500. As of April 24, 2009, we also have commitments relating to financing and operating leasing arrangements with BNPPLC ("Leasing Arrangements 2, 3, 4") for land and approximately 374,274 square feet of buildings located in Sunnyvale, California, costing up to $101,050. Under these leasing arrangements, we began paying BNPPLC minimum lease payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates. We will make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease terms, we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 24, 2009, and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements:
     All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 24, 2009. Such specified financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments.
     On April 1, 2009, we terminated two leasing arrangement in connection with two buildings located in Sunnyvale, California and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and repaid $119,297 of the outstanding balance under the leasing arrangements, a portion of which is included in construction-in-progress at April 24, 2009.
     On December 1, 2008, we terminated a leasing arrangement in connection with a separate building located in Sunnyvale, California and repaid $8,080 of the outstanding balance drawn under the construction allowance. As a result of these terminations, we are no longer contractually obligated to pay lease payments for the lease periods and the residual guarantees.
     
Guarantees
     As of April 24, 2009, our financial guarantees consisted of standby letters of credit outstanding, bank guarantees, foreign rent guarantees, service performance guarantees, customs and duties guarantees, VAT requirements, workers' compensation plans and surety bonds, which were primarily related to self insurance. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these arrangements was $12,104 as of April 24, 2009, of which $1,001 and $5,182 were collateralized as short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, respectively, on our balance sheet. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these arrangements was $253,350 as of April 25, 2008, of which $2,953 and $247,234 were collateralized by short-term and long-term restricted cash, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
     
Warranty Reserve
     We provide customers a warranty on software of ninety days and a warranty on hardware with terms ranging from one to three years. Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered necessary. During fiscal year 2009, 2008, and 2007, we accrued warranty charges of $25,909, $26,997 and $22,082, respectively. As of April 24, 2009 and April 25, 2008, our warranty reserve accrual balances were $42, 325 and $42,815, respectively.
 
     
Recourse and Nonrecourse Leases
     We have both recourse and nonrecourse lease financing arrangements with third-party leasing companies through preexisting relationships with customers. Under the terms of recourse leases, which are generally three years or less, we remain liable for the aggregate unpaid remaining lease payments to the third-party leasing company in the event that any customers default. These arrangements are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. For these recourse arrangements, revenues on the sale of our product to the leasing company are deferred and recognized into income as payments to the leasing company are received. As of April 24, 2009, and April 25, 2008, the maximum recourse exposure under such leases totaled approximately $25,682 and $24,842, respectively. Under the terms of the nonrecourse leases, we do not have any continuing obligations or liabilities. To date, we have not experienced material losses under our lease financing programs.
     
Purchase Commitments
     In the normal course of business we make commitments to our third party contract manufacturers, to manage manufacturer lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties, to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change.
     
Indemnification agreements
     We enter into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to defend and indemnify the other party  primarily our customers or business partners or subcontractors  for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any suit or claim brought against them alleging that our products sold to them infringe any U.S. patent, copyright, trade secret, or similar right. If a product becomes the subject of an infringement claim, we may, at our option: (i) replace the product with another noninfringing product that provides substantially similar performance; (ii) modify the infringing product so that it no longer infringes but remains functionally equivalent; (iii) obtain the right for the customer to continue using the product at our expense and for the reseller to continue selling the product; (iv) take back the infringing product and refund to customer the purchase price paid less depreciation amortized on a straight-line basis. We have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions historically. We have not recorded any liability at April 24, 2009, and April 25, 2008, respectively, related to these guarantees since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not determinable, other than as described above.
     
Legal Contingencies
     We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which may arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, operating results, or financial condition.
     In April 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with the United States of America, acting through the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and on behalf of the General Services Administration (the "GSA"), under which we agreed to pay the United States $128,000, plus interest of $715, related to a dispute regarding our discount practices and compliance with the price reduction clause provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005.
     On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in January 2008. The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery phase and no trial date has been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations. Since we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of April 24, 2009.
 
15. Subsequent Event
     On May 20, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the merger agreement) by and among us, Kentucky Merger Sub One Corporation, our wholly owned subsidiary, referred to as Merger Sub One, Derby Merger Sub Two LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, referred to as Merger Sub Two, and Data Domain. The merger agreement was subsequently amended on June 3, 2009 to reflect the terms described below. The merger agreement provides for the acquisition of Data Domain by NetApp by means of a merger of Merger Sub One with and into Data Domain, referred to as the first-step merger, with Data Domain as the interim surviving entity, immediately followed by a merger of Data Domain, as the interim surviving entity, with and into Merger Sub Two, referred to as the second-step merger, with Merger Sub Two as the final surviving entity.
     Upon the completion of the first-step merger, Data Domain will become our wholly owned subsidiary, and each share of Data Domain common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the first-step merger, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, subject to adjustment as described below, a combination of $16.45 in cash, or the cash consideration, without interest and less any required withholding, and a certain number of shares of our common stock, or the stock consideration, and together with the cash consideration, the merger consideration. The number of shares of our common stock issuable in exchange for Data Domain common stock will be determined by dividing $13.55 by the closing average, defined as the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the 10 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the first-step merger; provided, that if the closing average is less than $17.41, each share of Data Domain common stock will be exchangeable for 0.7783 shares of our common stock and if the closing average is greater than $21.27, each share of Data Domain common stock will be exchangeable for 0.637 shares of our common stock. In the event that the exchange ratio is greater than or equal to 0.7006 and less than 0.7783, we may (a) reduce the stock consideration by such amount as we may determine and (b) increase the cash consideration by an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount of such reduction in the stock consideration multiplied by (ii) the closing average. However, we may not reduce the amount of the stock consideration and increase the cash consideration as described in the immediately preceding sentence to the extent that it would reasonably be expected to cause the merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, if the aggregate amount of the stock consideration issuable in the merger (including the stock consideration issuable to holders of Data Domain options and restricted stock units) would exceed 19.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the first-step merger, the stock consideration will be decreased to the minimum extent necessary so that no more than 19.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be issued in the merger (with such percentage measured immediately prior to the effective time of the first-step merger). In such event, the cash consideration will be increased by an amount equal to the product of (a) the amount of the reduction in the stock consideration multiplied by (b) the closing average. In the event that the stock consideration is decreased in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, the merger may fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code.
     Upon the completion of the first-step merger, each outstanding Data Domain stock option, whether or not then vested and exercisable, will be assumed and converted by us. In accordance with its terms and the requirements of applicable law, each option shall (i) be converted into an option to acquire that number of shares of our common stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Data Domain common stock subject to such option, by (y) the option exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (ii) have an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the per share exercise price of Data Domain common stock subject to such option, by (y) the option exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent. The option exchange ratio is calculated as the sum of (x) the stock consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement for a share of Data Domain common stock plus (y) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the cash consideration to be received pursuant to the merger agreement for a share of Data Domain common stock, by (2) the average closing sales prices of our common stock, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent, for the ten most recent consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. Each assumed and converted option shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including as to vesting and exercisability) as were applicable to the option immediately prior to the completion of the first-step merger.
     Each of Data Domain's unvested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock outstanding at the effective time of the first-step merger shall be assumed and converted into restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock, as applicable, representing the right to receive merger consideration payable for shares of Data Domain underlying each assumed and converted restricted stock unit or restricted share, as applicable. Each assumed and converted restricted stock unit and share of restricted stock shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions, including vesting restrictions, as were applicable to such award immediately prior to the completion of the first-step merger.
 
     The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The transaction is valued at approximately $2 billion and is expected to be completed in 60 to 120 days.

Quarterly Highlights
 
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, NetApp unveiled its cloud strategy and introduced several new products and solutions to help customers transform their data center architectures to achieve greater storage efficiency through innovative data management techniques. NetApp also received numerous industry accolades for its work environment, products, innovative use of technology, and executive leadership.
 
The makeup of the data center is changing drastically as companies seek to take advantage of virtualization and highly efficient infrastructures. NetApp is primed to take advantage of this major shift in the market by offering enterprises industry-leading storage efficiency and data management solutions that are well suited for both internal and external cloud deployments.
 
This quarter NetApp introduced Data ONTAP 8, the culmination of years of engineering effort to integrate the Data ONTAP 7G operating system with a next-generation scale-out architecture. Data ONTAP 8 will provide seamless data mobility and secure multi-tenancy, both of which are key requirements for the most sophisticated cloud infrastructures. In addition, Data ONTAP 8 provides a more robust platform for the next 10 years of innovation from NetApp.
 
 
 
NetApp also introduced the following new products and enhancements that uniquely complement VMware vSphere 4 and VMware View to help customers optimize their desktop and cloud computing environments: Virtual Storage Console, SnapManager for Virtual Infrastructure, and Rapid Cloning Utility.
 
Showing its commitment to midsize enterprise and distributed enterprise customers, NetApp announced the new FAS2040 storage system, providing customers with increased performance and capacity to handle demanding Microsoft Windows consolidation and virtualization workloads all on the same system. NetApp also announced significant price reductions for its FAS2020 systems and associated software, which are now preconfigured with high-capacity drives and include all protocols.
 
During the quarter, NetApp extended its leadership in Ethernet storage with standards-based products that support converged Ethernet (FCoE, iSCSI, NFS, CIFS) data access and help customers streamline their data centers and maximize ROI. With partners such as Cisco and QLogic, NetApp is expanding Ethernet as a storage infrastructure.
 
In an effort to help customers maximize the value of their existing storage investments, NetApp unveiled a program to help customers achieve greater storage efficiency in their data centers. Under the terms of the Zero Investment Promise(3) Program ("ZIP Program"), customers with EMC and HP SANs that deploy NetApp V-Series can reduce storage capacity and the associated costs of their existing third-party storage investments. If after 90 days the customer files an approved claim that the storage savings are not achieved, the customer will keep the equipment at no charge.
 
Finally, in addition to NetApp's various solution and program announcements during the quarter, the company received the following awards and industry recognition:

"Safe Harbor" Statement Under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results, share count and metrics for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and the benefits that we expect our customers to realize from using our products. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include risks associated with the anticipated growth in network storage and content delivery markets; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; competition risks, including our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products; and other important factors as described in NetApp reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections captioned "Risk Factors" in our most recently submitted 10-K. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
 
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. Non-GAAP results of operations exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, merger termination proceeds (net of related expenses), restructuring and other charges, noncash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net loss or gain on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, but includes a proforma tax provision based upon our projected annual proforma effective tax rate. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
 
NetApp Use of Corporate Web Site
 
In accordance with SEC guidance published on August 22, 2008 (Release No. 34-58288), NetApp will begin to disseminate material information about the company through its corporate Web site within the next several fiscal quarters. NetApp intends to designate a separate portion of its corporate Web site for purposes of these disclosures and will include a prominent link on its Web site to allow visitors to locate this material information, which will be routinely updated. The Web site will supplement, rather than replace, NetApp's current existing channels of information distribution.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 17, 2009, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of NetApp, Inc. (the "Company") approved a revised form of indemnification agreement and authorized the Company to enter into such agreement with each of its current and future directors, all of its officers (as defined in Rule 16a-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and any other individual designated as a covered officer by the Board. The Company has entered into revised indemnification agreements with each of the directors and officers listed below:
 
A description of the revised form of indemnification agreement is provided below and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the agreement itself, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending January 29, 2010.
The Company has adopted the revised form of indemnification agreement to provide the officers and directors listed above (each such individual, an "indemnified party") with indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable law. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the revised agreement provides, among other things, that, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Company is obligated to indemnify each indemnified party against all expenses and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnified party or on his or her behalf in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other proceeding in which such indemnified party is, was or at any time becomes involved by reason of (i) the fact that such indemnified party is or was an officer or a director of the Company, (ii) any act or omission by such indemnified party while serving as an officer or a director of the Company, or (iii) the fact that such indemnified party is or was serving at the request of the Company as an officer, director or employee of any other enterprise. In addition, the Company is obligated to advance all expenses incurred by an indemnified party in connection with an action, suit or other proceeding, provided that such indemnified party must repay the advanced expenses to the extent that it is ultimately determined that the indemnified party is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses under the terms of the revised form of indemnification agreement.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 17, 2009, the Company terminated its Unsecured Credit Agreement, dated as of November 2, 2007 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, certain lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The termination
 
became effective on December 22, 2009 under the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provided for a revolving unsecured credit facility of up to $250.0 million with a term of five years from the effective date of November 2, 2007. No borrowings were outstanding at the time of termination, and no penalties resulted from the early termination. The Company terminated the Credit Agreement primarily because the credit facility is not currently necessary to support the company's current and anticipated capital requirements. JPMorgan Chase Bank remains a counterparty to the convertible note hedge transactions that the Company entered into in June 2008 in connection with its offering of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On December 17, 2009, the Board appointed T. Michael Nevens and Gerald Held as members of the Board to fill the newly created vacancies disclosed under Item 5.03 below. In addition, the Board has appointed Mr. Nevens as a member of Audit Committee and Investment & Acquisition Committee and Mr. Held as a member of the Compensation Committee and Investment & Acquisition Committee.
There are no arrangements or understandings between either Mr. Nevens or Mr. Held, on the one hand, and the Company or any other persons, on the other, pursuant to which either Mr. Nevens or Mr. Held was selected as a director. There are no related party transactions between the Company and either Mr. Nevens or Mr. Held (or any immediate family member thereof) requiring disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
As directors, each of Messrs. Nevens and Held is eligible to receive either stock options or a combination of stock options and restricted stock units under the Automatic Option Grant Program (the "Program") in effect under the 1999 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated through August 17, 2009 (the "1999 Stock Option Plan"). Under the terms of the Program, each newly elected non-employee director is automatically granted either an option to purchase 55,000 shares of the Company's common stock (an "option award") or, in the alternative, a mixed award consisting of an option to purchase 27,500 shares of common stock and 9,166 restricted stock units (a "mixed award"). Mr. Nevens elected to receive an option award as his initial grant, and Mr. Held elected to receive a mixed award. In addition to the foregoing, each of Messrs. Nevens and Held is also eligible to receive an annual cash retainer. A description of the 1999 Stock Option Plan and the Company's policy for compensating its nonemployee directors with annual cash retainers is described in to the Company's most recent proxy statement, filed with the SEC on August 20, 2009.
As described under Item 1.01 above, each of Messrs. Nevens and Held has entered into the Company's newly adopted form of indemnification agreement.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On December 17, 2009, the Board approved an amendment to the Company's bylaws to increase the number of authorized directors on the Board from nine (9) to eleven (11). A copy of the Certificate of Amendment to the Bylaws of NetApp, Inc. is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.1.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 17, 2010, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and prepared remarks reporting financial results for the third quarter ended January 29, 2010.  The press release and prepared remarks are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP) , the press release and prepared remarks furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For its internal budgeting and resource allocation purposes, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures that exclude: (a) the GSA settlement, (b) amortization of intangible assets, (c) stock-based compensation expenses, (d) merger termination proceeds (net of related expenses), (e) restructuring and other charges, (f) asset impairment, (g) noncash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (h) net loss or gain on investments and (i) related income tax effects.  NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to its competitors historical results and operating guidance.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A.   NetApp excludes from its revenue the impact of its GSA settlement because management believes that the settlement amount does not reflect NetApps underlying business or future revenue generating potential and, therefore, management excludes the settlement amount in assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
GSA Settlement.
B. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets primarily in connection with its acquisition of certain businesses and technologies. The amortization of intangible assets represents non-cash charges and management finds it useful to exclude them variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
C.   NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds excluding them useful in order to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
 D.   NetApp excludes merger termination proceeds (net of related expenses) from its non-GAAP measures primarily because these proceeds were not generated by our on-going business and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.

In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. Non-GAAP results of operations exclude the GSA settlement, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, merger termination proceeds (net of related expenses), restructuring and other charges, asset impairment, noncash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net loss or gain on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors' understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures in our earnings announcement because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making, such as employee compensation planning. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

regarding
our financial performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.  
 
 
All numbers stated herein are GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between non-GAAP and GAAP, refer to the table at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
 
Q3 Fiscal 2010 Overview
 
NetApp achieved several records in the third quarter, including record revenue, record number of systems shipped, record performance from nearly every geography, record income from operations and record net income per share. Our storage efficiency solutions are driving significant demand as customers begin to refresh and re-architect their data centers. Our record performance was achieved despite supply constraints which extended lead times throughout the quarter.
 
 
Revenue
 
 
Revenue for the third quarter was $1.01 billion, up 11% sequentially and up 16% over non-GAAP revenue of $874 million in Q3 of last year. Foreign currency effects improved sequential results by 0.5 percentage points, and increased our year over year growth rate by about two percentage points.
 
Product revenue grew 18% sequentially and was up 17% year over year to $619 million. Products increased in the mix to 61% of total revenue. As we discussed on last quarters call, we will no longer break out the mix of add-on software due to the increase in our bundled product offerings which mask the distinction between software and systems. It is no longer a useful indicator, given that the metric had been trending at the lowest levels in several years, yet product margins have been at or near all-time highs. The best proxy for the impact of software on our business going forward is our product gross margins.
 
 
GAAP revenue in Q3FY09 was $746 million. Non-GAAP revenue in Q3FY09 excludes the impact of the $128 million GSA settlement.
1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (E&M), which is a deferred revenue element, was $171 million, or 17% of total revenue. Software E&M was up 1% sequentially and up 9% year over year. The growth in software E&M revenue will tend to track product revenue growth, albeit on a lagged basis.
 
Service revenue was $222 million and 22% of total revenue, up 3% sequentially and up 17% over Q3 of last year. Service revenues are comprised mainly of hardware maintenance support contracts and professional services.
 
 
 
 
Gross Margin
 
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was a 64.2% of revenue this quarter, in line with the forecast we provided at the end of the second quarter. This was about three percentage points lower than Q2which we stated was unsustainably high. The decline to a more sustainable level this quarter was due to the return to more typical product margins and a modestly lower contribution from deferred elements coming off of the balance sheet. These deferred revenue elements carry a very high margin.
 
As expected, non-GAAP product gross margin was also down just over three percentage points sequentially to 59.8%. We did not expect last quarters unusually favorable configuration mix to continue into Q3, and we passed along  cost savings to customers during the quarter in order to stimulate share gains.
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP service margin pulled back to 50.4% due to higher than expected commissions for professional services.
 
Non-GAAP Software E&M gross margins were up just slightly to 98.3%.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% sequentially and were up 13% year-over-year, totaling $479 million or 47% of revenue. These expense levels were approximately 6% above the midpoint of our forecast for the third quarter, primarily due to higher than planned accruals for commissions and incentive compensation related to outperformance on both the revenue and operating income lines. We also began selectively hiring in sales and engineering.  Headcount at the end of the quarter was 8,174  a net increase of 69 people.
 
On a GAAP basis, Q3 operating expenses include $32 million of stock compensation expense compared to $30 million in Q2, as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions and the current period impact of prior restructuring actions.
 
Income from Operations & Other Income
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP income from operations was up 10% sequentially and 60% year over year to $171 million, or 16.9% of revenue.
 
Non-GAAP other income and expense was $0.33 million due to continued low interest rate levels.  GAAP other income / (expense) also includes $12.5 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt.
 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $171 million, or 16.9% of revenue. Our non-GAAP provision for income tax was $27 million and our effective tax rate remains at 16%. With the increase in stock price weighing heavily on the treasury method of accounting for shares outstanding again this quarter, NetApps diluted share count increased sequentially by 10.6 million shares to 360 million shares outstanding.
 
Non-GAAP net income totaled $144 million, or $0.40 cents per share, a new record for NetApp.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Select Balance Sheet Items
 
Q3 cash and short term investments totaled $3.2 billion. At the end of Q3, our cash and short term investments domiciled in the U.S. were 53% of this balance.
 
The total deferred revenue balance of $1.8 billion reflects a sequential increase of approximately $73 million this quarter and a 10% increase in the balance year over year.
 
With respect to DSO, accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 41 days this quarter, compared to an unusually low 32 days last quarter and 36 days in Q3 last year. Our current DSO of 41 days represents a more sustainable level.
 
Inventory turns were approximately 20 turns, up slightly from Q2, and up from 17 turns in Q3 of last year.
 
 
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by number of days in the quarter. (Calculation based on non-GAAP revenue in Q3FY09)
2
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP COGS divided by net inventory
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $195 million, down 27% sequentially, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable this quarter. Capital expenditures were about $50 million, up from $23 million last quarter, due to the purchase of land in India.
 
Free cash flow totaled $145 million, down 22% from Q3 last year. Expressed as a percent of revenue, Q3 free cash flow was 14% of revenue, below our targeted range of 17% - 22% as a result of a large increase in accounts receivable from the record low DSO level in Q2.  Accounts receivables should remain relatively stable going forward, so free cash flow as a percent of revenue should return to our targeted range in Q4.
 
Q4 FY10 Outlook
 
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and current market conditions, and reflects our non-GAAP presentation.
 
Other Business Metrics
 
 
 
Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment

Geographic Mix
 
The Americas contributed 57% of total revenue, Americas revenue was up 16% sequentially and up 26% year over year. Included in the Americas, the US Public Sector Team delivered 14% of total revenue, despite fiscal Q3 usually being a seasonally slower period for government purchases.
 
EMEA was up 5% sequentially and up 7% year over year to 33% of total revenue. AsiaPacific contributed 10% of revenue this quarter, up 9% sequentially and down 3% year over year.
 
Channel Mix
 
Direct revenue was 30% of total revenue, up 4% sequentially and up 15% year over year. Indirect channel contribution was 70%, up 15% sequentially and up 16% over Q3 last year. Within the indirect channel, Arrow grew to a record 16% of total revenue and Avnet contributed a record 12% of revenue. Revenue from the IBM OEM partnership was a record high, accounting for nearly 6% of total revenue and up 9% over Q3 last year.
 
Large Customer Mix
 
The top 100 accounts were somewhat more balanced in the mix this quarter, accounting for about 42% of total revenue. Within that number was a seasonal decline in government business and an increase in contribution from commercial accounts.

Protocol Trends
 
Of configured system product revenue, this was our first quarter in which unified systemssystems sold with both a SAN and a NAS protocolexceeded that of NAS-only systems. 15% of our configured system product revenue included a SAN protocol this quarter, just over 42% was unified, and about 42% was NAS only. We shipped a record number of NFS and CIFS licenses in Q3, and we are now shipping FCoE targets in production quantities.
 
According to our system-reported data, in virtualized server environments we are now consistently seeing about 42% of NetApp machines are running NAS and 58% are running SAN. We are also now beginning to see HyperV environments in the customer base.
 
Platform Trends
 
Total systems shipped grew dramatically this quarter, up 54% sequentially and up 34% year over year. While unit sales of all platform levels grew both sequentially and year over year, the step-function growth came from new mid-sized enterprise (MSE) business driving huge demand for our low end systems through the channel. Sales of high-end units were also up again this quarter, growing 29% sequentially and 16% year over year, and mid-range units shipped also grew by double digits both sequentially and year over year. Low end units were up 83% sequentially and up 48% year over year.
 
Our V-Series platform, which is our controller and data management software without any disks, delivered yet another record revenue quarter, and accounted for almost 20% of the net new Storage5000 accounts added during the period. This product is designed to provide NetApp data management and storage efficiency in front of large footprints of legacy SAN products offered by our competitors. It allows customers to experience NetApp functionality without a big initial investment, and it can pay for itself almost immediately with the space reclaimed when our space efficiency technologies are enabled. In fact, we guarantee a 35% capacity savings when deployed in front of other vendors arrays. Units of V-Series shipped were up 68% year over year, and the fastest growing segments of this business are selling into EMC and HP midrange environments.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Capacity Trends
 
Total petabytes shipped grew 25% sequentially and 42% year over year to 326 petabytes. The mix of drive capacity also changed, with Fibre Channel dropping to 27% of total capacity shipped, ATA declining modestly to 64% of capacity shipped, and SAS tripling to 9% of capacity shipped this quarter.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 26, 2010, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended April 30, 2010.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of operating results and net income that exclude: (a) the GSA settlement, (b) amortization of intangible assets, (c) stock-based compensation expenses, (d) acquisition related income and expenses, (e) restructuring and other charges, (f) asset impairments, (g) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (h) net losses or gains on investments, and (i) our GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate  for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year . NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A.   NetApp excludes from its revenue as well from its budgeting, planning and forecasting of future periods the impact of the settlement with the GSA because management believes that the settlement related to certain past business practices, and is not representative of NetApps on-going business and future revenue generating potential.
GSA Settlement.
B. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
C.   NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, it does not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
 
 
 
 D.   NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including merger termination proceeds,  from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related (income) expenses, net.
 E. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
F. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairment.
G. .  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
H. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
(Gain) loss on investments, net.
 
I. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of  net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate  for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP results of operations exclude the GSA settlement, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.  We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. In addition, we have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Fiscal 2010 Highlights
 
In fiscal 2010, NetApp achieved company records in several categories, including revenue, income from operations, and net income per share.
 
Year over Year Overview
 
 
 
Fiscal year 2010 revenue was $3.93 billion, an 11% increase over FY2009 net revenue. Non-GAAP gross margins were 65%, up from 61.1% in FY 2009, due to a favorable revenue mix as well as favorable trends in materials cost for low-end and mid-range systems.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10% year over year.  We returned to our targeted non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 16%, up from our FY2009 operating margin of 11.6%. These improvements in profitability are reflected in our non-GAAP net income per share, which rose 39% from $1.09 in FY 2009 to $1.51 in FY2010.
 
 
GAAP revenue in FY2009 was $3,406 million, Non-GAAP revenue in FY2009 excludes the impact of the $129 million GSA settlement

Q4 Fiscal 2010 Overview
 
In the fourth quarter, NetApp achieved record performance in revenue, income from operations, net income per share, deferred revenue, cash flow from operations, and units shipped.  As customers increasingly turn to server virtualization and the benefits of cloud computing to reduce IT costs, they are choosing NetApp for the storage efficiency and flexibility we provide as they begin to re-architect their data centers for a virtual future.
 
 
 Revenue
 
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.17 billion, increasing 16% sequentially and 33% year over year. Foreign currency effects decreased our sequential results by approximately one percentage point and increased our year over year growth rate by approximately two percentage points.

Sequential growth calculation based upon Q3FY10 results, which can be found at www.investor.netapp.com

Foreign currency effects represent the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
3
 
 
 
Product revenue grew 23% sequentially and increased 50% year over year to $759 million. The product component of our revenue mix increased to 65% of total revenue, up strongly from 61% last quarter.
 
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized ratably over the related contract period, was $174 million, or 15% of total revenue. SEM was up 2% sequentially and up 6% year over year, reflecting the slower business growth rates of prior periods.  Product revenue growth can be viewed as a leading indicator for future SEM revenue growth.  The average contract life on the balance sheet for SEM is approximately 32 months.
 
Service revenue was $239 million, up 8% sequentially and up 14% over 2009 Q4 revenue. Service revenue represented 20% of total revenue and is comprised mainly of hardware maintenance support contracts and professional services.
 
 
 
 Gross Margin
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was 64.6% of revenue this quarter, a slight increase from Q3 results. There were no significant changes in non-GAAP product or SEM gross margins from the prior quarter. Non-GAAP service margin increased five percentage points sequentially to 55.8%, due primarily to a seasonal increase in professional services work completed.
 
 Operating Expenses
 
Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 13% sequentially and were up 27% year over year, totaling $541 million or 46% of revenue in Q4. Headcount increased by a net of 159 people to 8,333 at the end of the quarter, consistent with our plan to increase our sales and engineering staff worldwide.
 
On a GAAP basis, Q4 operating expenses include $33 million of stock compensation compared to $32 million in Q3, as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, current period impact of prior restructuring actions and acquisition related expenses.
 
 Income from Operations & Other Income
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP income from operations was up 27% sequentially and 84% year over year to $217 million, or 18.5% of revenue, significantly outpacing our target operating margin of approximately 16%.
 
Non-GAAP other income and expense increased to $3 million, primarily due to realized gains on investments as well as a shift toward longer-term investment vehicles.  GAAP other income (expense) also includes $13 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt.
 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $220 million or 18.7% of revenue, up from 16.9% in Q3. Our non-GAAP provision for income tax was $36 million, up from $27 million in Q3, and our effective tax rate increased to 16.6% from our average of 16% in prior quarters due to a year-end true-up.  As a result, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY2010 was 16.2%. Our diluted share count increased sequentially by 4.2 million shares to 365 million shares outstanding.
 
Non-GAAP net income totaled $183 million, or $0.50 per share, another record for NetApp.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Select Balance Sheet Items
 
During Q4, our cash and short term investments grew by $491 million, ending the quarter at $3.7 billion, up 15% sequentially and up 43% year over year.  Of this Q4 FY10 balance, 56% was in the United States.
 
The total deferred revenue balance of $1.9 billion reflects a sequential increase of approximately $120 million this quarter and a 12% increase in the balance year over year.
 
With respect to DSO, accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 37 days this quarter, compared to 41 days last quarter and 46 days in Q4 last year.  The strong DSO performance is attributable to record collection efforts on the part of our accounts receivables team. At the end of Q4, 93% of our receivables balance was current. Inventory turns were down from 20.2 turns in Q3 to 14.7 turns, a side effect of the rapid growth we are experiencing and the  unpredictable spot shortages of some parts.
 
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP COGS divided by net inventory
5
 
 
 
 
 
 Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $475 million, more than doubling both sequentially and year over year, primarily due to strong growth in net income, increased deferred revenue, and well managed receivables.  Capital expenditures were about $38 million, down from $50 million last quarter.
 
Free cash flow totaled $436 million, over three times higher than Q3 levels. Expressed as a percent of revenue, Q4 free cash flow was 37% of net revenue, well above our average range.
 
 Q1 FY11 Outlook
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and current market conditions.
 
Other Business Metrics
 
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash purchases of property and equipment
6
 
 
 
 Geographic Mix
 
The Americas generated revenue of $639 million, up 11% sequentially and up 34% year over year, contributing 54% of total revenue. Included in the Americas numbers, the US Public Sector Team delivered 11% of total revenue, which was seasonally down by approximately 7% sequentially, though up 30% year over year.
 
EMEA revenue increased 24% sequentially and 32% year over year to $419 million, comprising 36% of total revenue. AsiaPacific revenue was $113 million, an increase of 14% sequentially and 31% year over year, for a total of 10% of revenue this quarter.
 
Channel Mix
 
Both our direct and indirect channels posted increases in revenue during the fourth quarter. Consistent with our strategy, our indirect channel continues to grow faster than our direct channel.  Direct revenue was 29% of total revenue, increasing 10% sequentially and 19% year over year.  Indirect revenues, generated by channel and OEM partners, contributed 71% of total revenues in the quarter.  Indirect revenues increased 19% sequentially and 40% over Q4 last year.  Within the indirect channel, Arrow continued last quarters record pace of 16% of total revenue, while Avnet was down slightly to 11% of revenue from last quarters record of 12% of revenue. Revenue from the IBM OEM partnership was 3% of total revenue, up 2% over their absolute dollar contribution in Q4 last year.
 
Customer Dynamics
 
 
 
 
This quarters top 100 accounts contributed approximately 42% of total Q4 revenue, about the same level as in Q3FY10.  In FY10 we added 121 net new Storage5000 accounts, down modestly from the record high number added in FY09.

 Protocol Trends
 
For over eight years, NetApp has been shipping storage systems which support multiple protocols concurrently on every systema capability called Unified Storage. We have shipped over 150,000 Unified Storage systems since we pioneered this innovation in 2002. This quarter the unified storage percentage of our configured system product revenue continued at record levels.
 
We continue to actively bundle and sell more of our systems in a Unified configuration. In addition, since all of our systems enable the use of multiple protocols for applications, we have found that our installed base usage profilesespecially for protocols frequently changes after installation, while the system configuration sold does not.  As a result, we have come to the conclusion that trying to partition our revenues across the traditional NAS and SAN categories at time of shipment it is no longer meaningful, therefore this will be the last quarter in which we provide the data in the chart above.
 
Platform Trends
 
Total system units shipped grew 10% sequentially again this quarter and also increased 52% over Q4 last year. The standout growth segment this quarter was our mid-range, which grew 36% sequentially and 40% year over year.  Sales of high-end units were also up strongly this quarter, growing 27% sequentially and 48% year over year.  While low end units were down modestly from last quarters record levels, they were up 61% over Q4 of last year.
 
 
The Storage 5000 is a proprietary NetApp list of companies we believe to be the 5,000 largest buyers of storage worldwide
7
 
 
 
Our V-Series platform, which is our controller and data management software without any disks, reached a milestone 5,000 units shipped since inception this quarter. Units of V-Series shipped were up 80% sequentially and over 230% higher year over year.
 
 Capacity Trends
 
 
Total petabytes shipped grew 37% sequentially and 82% year over year to 445 petabytes. The mix of drive capacity continued to trend toward SAS and ATA, with ATA remaining by far the largest segment as customers utilize our efficiency features to get more out of our storage on less expensive drives.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
 
 
 
 
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance. Non-GAAP operating results and net income exclude the GSA settlement, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rates for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP provision for the fourth quarter. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
 
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On August 18, 2010, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the first quarter ended July 30, 2010.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.   NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, it does not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
 C.   NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including merger termination proceeds, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
 
 
 
 D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F. .  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net
losses or gains.
 
H. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision from its non-GAAP measure of  net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate  for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between our non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the table at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
 
Q1 Fiscal 2011 Overview
 
Fiscal year 2011 is off to a good start for NetApp. With a 51% year over year increase in product revenue and higher than expected profitability, this is the strongest first quarter in our history. The strength of our business is evident in many aspects, with year over year increases in revenue across all geographies, greater contributions from channel partners and strong cash generation.
 
 
Revenue
 
 
Net revenue for the first quarter was $1.14 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially and an increase of 36% year over year. Foreign currency effects decreased our sequential results by approximately one percentage point and had an immaterial effect on our year over year revenue growth rate.
2
 
Product revenue declined 5% sequentially to $721 million and increased 51% year over year. This is the second consecutive quarter of at least 50% year over year product revenue growth. The product component of revenue decreased slightly as part of the overall revenue mix to 63% of total revenue, from 65% last quarter.
 
 
Sequential growth calculation based upon Q4FY10 results, which can be found at www.investor.netapp.com
1
 
Foreign currency effects represent the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
2
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized over the related contract period, was $175 million or 15% of total revenue.SEM revenue was flat sequentially and increased 6% year over year
 
.
 
Service revenue was $242 million, an increase of 1% sequentially and 25% year over year.Service revenue was up slightly from last quarter to 21% of total revenue and is comprised mainly of hardware maintenance support contracts and professional services.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross Margin
 
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was 64.5% of revenue for the first quarter, a slight decrease from the prior quarter with lower product gross margins partially offset by higher service gross margins
.
 
Operating Expenses
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $519 million, a decrease of 4% sequentially and an increase of 17% year over year. Q1 operating expenses remained at 46% of revenue, similar to Q4.
 
In keeping with our plan to grow our sales and engineering staff worldwide, our headcount increased by 640 people from Q4, ending Q1 with 8,973 employees. Approximately 200 of the increase came from a combination of employees from the Bycast acquisition and new college hires.
 
On a GAAP basis, Q1 operating expenses include stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. Stock compensation was $40 million in Q1 compared to $33 million in Q4, due in large part to higher valuation of employee equity awards.  
Income from Operations & Other Income
 
Non-GAAP income from operations decreased 1% sequentially and increased 141% year over year to $214 million, or 18.9% of revenue.
 
 
 
Non-GAAP other income and expense, net was $4 million. GAAP other income and expense, net includes approximately $13 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt.
 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $218 million or 19.2% of revenue, up from 18.7% in Q4. Our non-GAAP provision for income taxes was $36 million, similar to Q4 levels, and our effective tax rate was 16.3%. Diluted share count was 374 million shares, approximately 4 million shares higher than we had projected, due primarily to significantly more option exercises in the quarter than expected.
 
Non-GAAP net income totaled $183 million, or $0.49 per share. GAAP net income totaled $142 million, or $0.38 per share.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Select Balance Sheet Items
 
During Q1, our cash and short term investments grew by $197 million, ending the quarter at $3.9 billion, up 5% sequentially and 47% year over year. Of this cash balance, 55% was held in the United States. The total deferred revenue balance of $1.9 billion increased 2% sequentially and 14% year over year.
 
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) declined in the first quarter to 30 days compared to 37 days in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Inventory turns improved from 14.7 turns in Q4 to 17.9 turns in Q1 as component supplies became more in balance with demand.
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $177 million, a decrease of 63% from Q4 and an increase of 364% year over year. The decrease in cash provided by operations is mainly attributable to payouts to our employees related to last years variable and incentive compensation plans. Capital expenditures were $40 million, an increase of $2 million from Q4. Free cash flow totaled $137 million, down 69% from Q4 but up 916% year over year. Q1 free cash flow represented 12% of total revenue.
 
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by number of days in the quarter.
3
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP COGS divided by net inventory.
4
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash purchases of property and equipment.  
5
 
Q2 FY11 Outlook
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and current market conditions.
 
 
 
Other Business Metrics
 
Geographic Mix
 
The Americas generated $634 million in revenue, down 1% sequentially and up 31% year over year, contributing 56% of total revenue. The US Public Sector, which is included in the Americas number, accounted for 14% of total revenue, an increase of 21% from Q4 and 45% year over year.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 17, 2010, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the second quarter and first six months ended October 29, 2010.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our co nvertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, it does not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
 C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including merger termination proceeds, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
 
 
 
 
 
 D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
H. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision from its non-GAAP measure of  net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate  for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accoun ting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

Safe Harbor Statement Under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results, share count, and metrics for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, expectations regarding current and new partnerships and strategic alliances, and the benefits that we expect our customers to realize from using our products and from our strategic alliances and partnerships. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, customer demand for our products and services including our recently announc ed new product introductions; our ability to increase revenue and manage our operating costs; increased competition risks associated with the anticipated growth in networked storage market; general economic and market conditions; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products; and other important factors as described in NetApp reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections captioned Risk Factors in our most recently submitted 10-K and 10-Q.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

regarding
our forecasted financial performance and share count for the third quarter of fiscal 2011.
 
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between our non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the tables at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
 
 
Q2 Fiscal 2011 Overview
 
For the second quarter of our fiscal year, we are pleased to post another quarter of strong financial performance with notable achievements in the areas of product revenue growth, profitability and cash generation. This quarter marks the third consecutive quarter of approximately 50% product revenue growth and above 30% company net revenue growth on a year over year basis. Along with the substantial revenue growth, our profitability was the highest in over a decade with non-GAAP income from operations of 19.8% of revenue. After another strong cash generation quarter, NetApp crossed the $4 billion mark in cash, cash equivalents and investments on the balance sheet.
 
Revenue
 
Net revenue for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, an increase of 6% sequentially and an increase of 33% year over year.
 
Foreign currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact on sequential growth and a negative impact of approximately 1% on year over year growth.
2
 
Aided by a strong showing in the US public sector, product revenue grew 8% sequentially to $780 million, an increase of 49% year over year. The revenue mix between product, software entitlements and maintenance (SEM) and service remained approximately the same in the second quarter as the first quarter.
 
Revenue from SEM, which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized over the related contract period, was $178 million or 15% of total revenue.SEM revenue grew 2% sequentially and increased 5% year over year
 
.
 
Service revenue was $249 million, an increase of 3% sequentially and 16% year over year. The majority of service revenue is derived from hardware maintenance support contracts and professional services.
 
 
Sequential growth calculation based upon Q1FY11 results, which can be found at www.investor.netapp.com

Foreign currency effects represent the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross Margin
 
On a non-GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was 66.9% of revenue this quarter, due in large part to higher product gross margins. Product gross margins increased 4.5 percentage points from Q1 levels to 62.6% of revenue in Q2. SEM gross margins were flat sequentially and service gross margins declined to 58.5% of revenue in Q2.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $569 million, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter and an increase of 24% year over year. Q2 operating expenses were 47% of revenue and comparable to Q1 levels.
 
Our global headcount increased to 9,343 people at the end of Q2, a net increase of 370 people over Q1. Similar to the prior quarter, the majority of these new hires were in engineering and sales.
 
On a GAAP basis, Q2 operating expenses included stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. Stock compensation expense was $34 million, down from $40 million in Q1.
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
 
In Q2 non-GAAP income from operations increased 12% sequentially and increased 55% year over year to $240 million, or 19.8% of revenue.
 
Non-GAAP other income, net was $3 million for Q2. GAAP other expense, net includes approximately $13 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, the same as last quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $242 million or 20.1% of revenue, up from 19.2% of revenue in the prior quarter. Our non-GAAP provision for income taxes was $39 million, up from $36 million in Q1 and our non-GAAP effective tax rate remained at 16.3%.
 
Net Income
 
Non-GAAP net income totaled $203 million, or $0.52 per share. GAAP net income totaled $165 million, or $0.42 per share.
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
 
Our Q2 dilutive share count was approximately 392 million, significantly higher than projected due to the impact of the convertible notes and warrants, which were issued in June, 2008. The notes will have a dilutive impact on our share count whenever our average quarterly stock price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, though that hedge will not be reflected until the notes are converted or mature as it is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP.  In Q2 the offset from the hedge would have reduced dilutive share count by approximately 10 million shares if the notes had been converted during the quarter.
 
The warrants become dilutive whenever the quarterly average stock price is above $41.28. The dilutive effect of the warrants is not hedged.  Since our average stock price was $46.28 in Q2, both the notes and the warrants were dilutive to share count. Until the notes are converted, or until they mature in June, 2013, whenever the average quarterly price of our stock is above $31.85, the impact of the notes will be reflected in our dilutive share count without the benefit of the offsetting hedge, and whenever the average quarterly price of our stock is above $41.28, the impact of the warrants will be reflected in our dilutive share count.
 
80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.

Select Balance Sheet Items
 
During Q2, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments grew by $461 million, ending the quarter at $4.4 billion, up 12% sequentially and 47% year over year. 57% of this cash balance was held in the United States.
 
The total deferred revenue balance of $2 billion increased 3% sequentially and 16% year over year.
 
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) increased in the second quarter to 34 days, up from 30 days in the first quarter. Inventory turns continue to improve from 18.8 turns in Q2, up from 17.9 turns in Q1.
 
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $365 million, more than double Q1 and up 37% year over year. Capital expenditures were $43 million, an increase of $3 million from Q1. Free cash flow totaled $321 million, increasing 134% sequentially and up 31% year over year. Q2 free cash flow represented 27% of total revenue.
 
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP COGS divided by net inventory.
5
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash purchases of property and equipment.

Q3 FY11 Outlook
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and current market conditions. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible note and warrants, based upon our average stock price of $54.97 for the first 10 days of our third We share count for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 will increase to approximately 408 million shares, including an estimated 16.9 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes and 9.9 million shares from outstanding warrants. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedges that are expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would equate to an offset of approximate ly 13.5 million shares if the conversion or maturity occurs in the third quarter.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors& #8217; understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 16, 2011, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended January 28, 2011.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
 C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including merger termination proceeds, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
  
 D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
H. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision from its non-GAAP measure of  net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate  for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects.
 
 
 
 
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

regarding
our forecasted financial performance and share count for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011.
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between our non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the tables at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q3 Fiscal Year 2011 Overview
 
Driven by the successful launch for our new products, our year over year product revenue growth was over 30% in Q3 despite tougher compares. Revenue growth was evident across all regions, with a notable 35% increase in EMEA over Q3 last year. Our profitability continues to expand with $211 million in non-GAAP net income this quarter, a 46% year over year gain. Cash generation remains robust as this quarter marks the second consecutive quarter of approximately $300 million in free cash flow.
 
 
Revenue
 
Net revenue for the third quarter grew 5% sequentially to $1,268 million, an increase of 25% year over year.
 
Foreign currency fluctuations increased our sequential results by approximately one percentage point while decreasing our year over year results by approximately one percentage point.
2
 
In the third quarter, product revenue was $818 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and 32% year over year. The product component of revenue remained constant at 65% of total revenue.
 
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized over the related contract period, was $184 million or 14% of total revenue. SEM revenue grew 3% sequentially and increased 8% year over year.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sequential growth calculation based upon Q2 FY11 results, which can be found at investors.netapp.com

Foreign currency effects represent the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
Service revenue was $266 million, an increase of 6% sequentially and 20% year over year. Service revenue was 21% of total revenue.
 
 
 
Gross Margin
 
On a non-GAAP basis, total gross margin was 65.5% of revenue for Q3, down from 66.9% in Q2 due mainly to lower product gross margins, partially offset by higher service margins.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $584 million, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter and an increase of 22% year over year. Q3 operating expenses were 46% of revenue, compared to 47% in Q2.
 
In Q3 we added net new 415 employees for a total global headcount of 9,758.
 
On a GAAP basis, Q3 operating expenses included stock compensation expense of $40 million, up from $34 million in Q2, and amortization of intangible assets.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
 
Non-GAAP income from operations was $247 million or 19.4% of revenue in Q3.  This represents an increase of 3% sequentially and 44% year over year.
 
In Q3, non-GAAP other income, net was $5 million. GAAP other expense, net includes approximately $13 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $252 million or 19.8% of revenue in Q3, compared to 20.1% of revenue in the prior quarter. Similar to the prior quarters of this fiscal year, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.3%.
 
Net Income
 
Non-GAAP net income totaled $211 million, or $0.52 per share. GAAP net income was $172 million, or $0.42 per share. Diluted share count increased 14 million shares from the prior quarter to approximately 406 million shares.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
 
For Q3, our dilutive share count was approximately 406 million, slightly lower than our guidance of approximately 408 million. With our average stock price for the quarter of $54.77, both the convertible notes and the warrants had a dilutive impact on our share count.
 
Our convertible notes have a dilutive impact on our share count whenever our average quarterly stock price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although that hedge will not be reflected until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013 as it is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q3, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 14 million shares.
 
Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.
Select Balance Sheet Items
 
For the third quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments grew by $374 million, ending the quarter at $4.8 billion, up 9% sequentially and 47% year over year. Similar to the prior quarter, 57% of the cash balance was held in the United States.
 
Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.1 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially and 19% year over year.
 
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) increased from 34 days in Q2 to 39 days in Q3. Q3 inventory turns of 18 were similar to last quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
3
 
80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP COGS divided by net inventory.
5
 
 
 
 
 
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $364 million, similar to last quarter and an increase of 86% over Q3 last year. Capital expenditures were $66 million, an increase of $23 million from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $297 million or 23% of revenue and decreased 7% sequentially but more than doubled year over year.
 
Q4 FY11 Outlook
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and current market conditions. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible note and warrants, based upon our average stock price of $58.22 for the first 10 days of our fourth quarter. We estimate share count for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 will increase to approximately 414 million shares, including an estimated 18 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes and 12 million shares from outstanding warrants. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedges that are expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would equate to an offset of approximately 14 million shares if the conversion or maturity occurs in the fourth quarter.
 
 
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash purchases of property and equipment.

Other Business Metrics
 
Geographic Mix
 
The Americas contributed $690 million, 54% of total revenue in Q3, a decrease of 7% sequentially and an increase of 19% year over year. The Americas numbers include the commercial and public sector. The U.S. commercial contributed $531 million or 42% of revenue, an increase of 6% sequentially and 23% year over year. The U.S. public sector generated $159 million or 12% of total revenue, a decrease of 34% from Q2 but an increase of 8% year over year.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Exhibit 99.1
NetApp to Purchase Engenio External Storage Systems Business of LSI Corporation
NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the Engenio external storage systems business of LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI), a publicly held company headquartered in Milpitas, California, in an all-cash transaction for $480 million. The close is anticipated to occur in approximately 60 days subject to customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to be accretive to NetApp's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share by the end of the second quarter of its 2012 fiscal year.
SUNNYVALE, Calif .March 9, 2011
Two of the trends that are driving rapid growth in the storage industry include virtualization and high performance, big bandwidth applications. Today, NetApp is the innovation leader for shared, virtualized IT infrastructures, delivering exceptional efficiency and flexibility for customers' next-generation data centers. Engenio will enable NetApp to address emerging and fast-growing market segments such as video, including full-motion video capture and digital video surveillance, as well as high performance computing applications, such as genomics sequencing and scientific research. NetApp has the channel reach and customer relationships today that require high performance and big bandwidth capabilities that will be well served by Engenio's storage platform. These segments are expected to collectively represent a $5 billion incremental market opportunity by 2014. The Engenio acquisition will also enable NetApp to expand its market reach with a mature OEM business that will further diversify its channels to market, especially in markets it currently doesn't address, such as server-attached and embedded storage.
Executive Quotes
Tom Georgens, president and CEO, NetApp
"We're excited about the acquisition of the Engenio business and the opportunity to significantly expand our addressable market and generate greater revenue growth. Our customers and partners have helped us emerge as an innovation leader and one of the fastest growing storage vendors in shared, virtualized IT infrastructures. With Engenio we will have a strategic storage platform to capitalize on new, high-growth opportunities that we don't currently reach with our FAS platform. NetApp also gains a proven OEM-based revenue stream that is run by a talented Engenio team. We believe that the synergies between NetApp and Engenio will create a compelling combination that will help us continue to scale our business and fuel our continued growth."
Abhi Talwalkar, president and CEO, LSI Corporation
"With its singular focus on storage, NetApp is well positioned to enhance the value of the Engenio business and enable new growth opportunities. NetApp's channel-friendly approach is highly synergistic with the Engenio model of enabling partner and customer success, and the combination should further advance the Engenio storage platform, as well as augment the OEM channels that have been the foundation of its longstanding success."

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 25, 2011, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended April 29, 2011.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
 C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, and (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
  
 D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired, or assets from acquisitions that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
 
 
 
 
H. . NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of  net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, NetApp adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, and ASU No. 2009-14 related to revenue recognition for transactions originating or materially modified in fiscal year 2011. These accounting standards generally result in earlier revenue recognition than under previous standards for certain deliverables in multiple-element arrangements. We implemented these standards retrospectively to the beginning of fiscal year 2011; therefore, the full year and previously reported quarterly results for fiscal year 2011 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of these new standards.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, NetApp adopted  Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, and ASU No. 2009-14 related to revenue recognition for transactions originating or materially modified in fiscal year 2011. We implemented these standards retrospectively to the beginning of fiscal year 2011; therefore the full year and previously reported fiscal 2011 quarterly results have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of these new standards.

our forecasted financial performance and share count for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012.
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards Related to Revenue Recognition
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, NetApp adopted mandatory new accounting standards related to revenue recognition for transactions originating or materially modified in fiscal year 2011. This accounting convention affects the way certain deliverables in multiple-element arrangements are recognized from a revenue perspective. We implemented these standards retrospectively to the beginning of fiscal year 2011; therefore the full year and previously reported quarterly results for fiscal 2011 have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of these new standards.
 
 
 
 
All fiscal year 2011 disclosures (both full year and quarterly) reflect the adoption of the new accounting standards. Fiscal year 2010 numbers have not been adjusted. Year over year comparisons reflect the new accounting standards for fiscal year 2011 results and the prior standards for fiscal year 2010 results.
Year over Year Overview
*
Reflects new accounting standards related to revenue recognition
Fiscal year 2011 net revenue was $5.12 billion, an increase of 30% over fiscal year 2010.  Non-GAAP gross margins were 65.6% and reflect incremental improvement over last years results.
Revenue growth of 30% year over year outpaced growth in operating expenses and non-GAAP operating margin was 20% for fiscal year 2011. Profitability gains are reflected in the 46% year over year increase in non-GAAP net income per share.
 
The table below provides a summary of the impact from adopting the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition for Q1  Q3 of fiscal year 2011.

Reflects new accounting standards related to revenue recognition
 
Our net revenues for the three months and twelve months ended April 29, 2011 include a favorable impact of $48.2 million and $129.2 million, respectively, from the adoption of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition. In Q2, application of the new standards included an incremental impact of approximately $28 million to both revenues and cost of revenues for a single transaction, the only such transaction of its kind, entered into in fiscal year 2011. While operating under the old methodology, the average impact of the first three quarters was just under $20 million per quarter. The gap was wider in Q4 as the previous methodology no longer governed our practices. For the adjusted Statements of Operations for Q1  Q3, please see page 14 of this commentary or on our website

Product revenue grew 14% sequentially and increased 27% year over year to $960 million. The product component of our revenue mix increased to 67% of net revenue, up from 65% last quarter.
Revenue from software entitlement and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized over the related contract period, was $187 million or 13% of net revenue. SEM revenue increased 2% sequentially and 8% year over year.
Service revenue was $281 million, an increase of 7% sequentially and 17% year over year. Service revenue represented 20% of net revenue.

Reflects new accounting standards related to revenue recognition
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $663 million, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter and an increase of 23% year over year. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of net revenue, compared to 45% last quarter.
In Q4 we crossed the 10,000 headcount mark by adding net new 454 employees for a total global headcount of 10,212 as of April 29, 2011.
On a GAAP basis, Q4 operating expenses included stock compensation expense of $44 million, up from $40 million in Q3, as well as amortization of intangibles, acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges.
 
 
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate

Reflects new accounting standards related to revenue recognition
Non-GAAP income from operations was $273 million or 19.1% of revenue in Q4. Non-GAAP income from operations rose 1% sequentially and 26% year over year.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $8 million in Q4. GAAP other expense, net includes $14 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $281 million or 19.7% of revenue in Q4, compared to 21.2% of revenue in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 15.8%.
Net Income
*
Reflects new accounting standards related to revenue recognition
Non-GAAP net income totaled $237 million or $0.59 per share. GAAP net income was $161 million or $0.40 per share. Diluted share count decreased by approximately 3 million shares in Q4 from the prior quarter.
 
 
 
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q4, our dilutive share count was approximately 404 million, slightly lower than our guidance of approximately 414 million. With an average stock price of $51.23 during Q4, both the convertible notes and warrants had a dilutive impact on our share count.
Our convertible notes have a dilutive impact on our share count whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price.  We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013 as it is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q4, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 12 million shares.
 
Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.

For Q4, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments grew by $419 million, ending the quarter at $5.2 billion, up 9% sequentially and 39% year over year. Of the Q4 cash balance, 59% was held in the US. Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.3 billion, an increase of 12% sequentially and 21% year over year.
Accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) increased from 39 days in Q3 to 47 days in Q4 partially due to material constraints at the beginning of the quarter. Q4 inventory turns were 18.1, similar to Q3 levels.
 
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items

Net cash provided by operating activities was $459 million, an increase of 29% sequentially and a decrease of 3% from Q4 last year.  Capital expenditures were $73 million, an increase of $7 million from last quarter.  Free cash flow totaled $386 million or 27% of revenue and increased 34% sequentially but decreased 12% year over year.
 
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by number of days in the quarter.

Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventory.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Q1 FY12 Outlook
This forecast reflects the Engenio acquisition which closed on May 9, new accounting standards related to revenue recognition and is based on current business expectations and current market conditions. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible note and warrants, based upon our average stock price of $52.98 for the first 10 days of our first quarter. We estimate share count for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 will increase to approximately 410 million shares, including an estimated 16 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes and 9 million shares from outstanding warrants. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedges that are expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would equate to an offset of approximately 13 million shares if the conversion or maturity occurs in the first quarter.

After market close on July 8, 2011, NetApp, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Contract") with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), under which the Company will repurchase approximately $200,000,000 of its shares of common stock, the final number of shares subject to adjustment described below. The Company will acquire these common shares under the existing share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the ASR Contract, the Company paid $200,000,000 to Bank of America on July 11, 2011. Shares will be delivered to the Company over the term of the ASR Contract, which is expected to end no later than November 25, 2011. The exact number of shares to be repurchased generally will be determined by the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of shares traded during the term of the agreement, subject to collar provisions that will establish minimum and maximum numbers of shares to be repurchased.
The ASR Contract contains the principal terms and provisions governing the accelerated share repurchase, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the number of shares that will be delivered, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the circumstances under which Bank of America is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Company and Bank of America to one another.
The foregoing description of the ASR Contract is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the ASR Contract, a copy of which will be filed with the Company's next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
 
The disclosure provided under Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On August 17, 2011, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the first quarter ended July 29, 2011.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
 
 
 
H. . NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Safe Harbor Statement
 
These prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, including the statements under the Q2 FY12 outlook section Actual results may differ materially from our statements or projections. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, customer demand for our products and services; our ability to effectively integrate the recently acquired Engenio external storage systems business and achieve our anticipated results for such business; our ability to increase revenue and manage our operating costs; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and services; increased competition risks; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers; general economic and market conditions, particularly U.S. budget and debt considerations and the continuing fiscal challenges in the Euro zone; our ability to deliver new product architectures and enterprise service offerings; and our ability to design products and services that compete effectively from a price and performance perspective. Other equally important factors are detailed in our accompanying press release as well as in our Annual and Quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively, on file with the SEC and also available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference into todays commentary.
regarding
our forecasted financial performance and share count for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between our non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the tables at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
 
 
Q1 Fiscal Year 2012
 
Revenue
 
 
Net revenue for the first quarter was $1.458 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially and 26% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations had a positive effect on revenue this quarter, increasing sequential results by approximately one percentage point and year over year results by approximately three percentage points.
2
 
Product revenue was $966 million, an increase of 1% sequentially and 31% year over year. Product revenue accounted for 66% of net revenue, down from 67% of net revenue in the prior quarter.
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized over the related contract period, was $198 million or 14% of revenue. SEM revenue grew 6% sequentially and 14% year over year.
Service revenue was $294 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and 22% year over year. Service revenue represented 20% of net revenue.
 
Sequential growth calculations are based upon Q4 FY11 results which can be found at investors.netapp.com

2
 
Foreign currency effects represent the changes in the average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
 
 
 
 
 
Gross Margin
 
Operating Expenses
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $652 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior quarter and an increase of 26% year over year. Q1 operating expenses were 45% of net revenue, compared to 46% of net revenue in the fourth quarter.
Our global headcount grew to 11,488 employees in the first quarter, adding 1,276 net new employees, including those related to the Engenio acquisition.
On a GAAP basis, Q1 operating expenses included stock compensation expense of   $53 million, an increase from $44 million in Q4, as well as $10 million in amortization of intangible assets and $5 million in acquisition related expenses.
 
 
 
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $269 million or 18.4% of revenue in Q1. This represents a 1% decline sequentially and an 18% increase year over year.
 
In Q1, non-GAAP other income, net was $5 million. GAAP other expense, net includes approximately $14 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $273 million or 18.7% of revenue in Q1, compared to 19.7% of revenue in Q4 and 20.1% of revenue in Q1 last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 18.7%.
Net Income
 
Non-GAAP net income totaled $222 million, or $0.55 per share. GAAP net income was $140 million, or $0.34 per share. Diluted share count increased by approximately 2 million shares from the prior quarter to approximately 406 million shares in Q1.
 
 
 
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q1, our dilutive share count was approximately 406 million, lower than our guidance of approximately 410 million. With an average stock price of $51.61 during Q1, both the convertible notes and the warrants continue to have a dilutive impact on our share count.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our share count.  We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013 as it is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q1, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 12 million shares.
 
Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.

80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.
 
 
 
 
Select Balance Sheet Items
During Q1, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by $461 million, ending the quarter at $4.7 billion, a decrease of 9% sequentially and an increase of 20% year over year. The decrease in cash balance was mainly due to the $480 million cash purchase of Engenio assets from LSI, our stock repurchases and the payout of last years variable and incentive compensation to our employees. Of this cash balance, 51% was held in the US. Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.4 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and 23% year over year.
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $241 million, a sequential decline of 48% and an increase of 36% from Q1 last year. Capital expenditures were $98 million, an increase of $25 million from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $142 million or 10% of revenue and represents a decrease of 63% sequentially and an increase of 4% year over year.
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventory.
5
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.
6
 
 
 
 
Q2 FY12 Outlook
This forecast is based on current business expectations and market conditions. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $43.04 for the first 10 days of our second quarter. We estimate share count for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 will decrease to approximately 392 million shares, including an estimated 10 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes and 2 million shares from outstanding warrants. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedge that is expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would offset approximately 8 million shares if the conversion or maturity were to occur in the second quarter.
 
 
 
 
Other Business Metrics
 
Please note that the addition of the E-Series revenue to our business impacts the results of many of our business metrics in Q1 and going forward, including the mix in geographies, channels, and disk drive capacity trends.
 
Geographic Mix
 
Americas contributed $813 million or 56% of revenue, an increase of 1% sequentially and 27% year over year. Included in the Americas number are the commercial sector and the public sector. The U.S. commercial sector contributed $645 million or 44% of revenue, an increase of 12% sequentially and 36% year over year. The U.S. public sector generated $168 million or 12% of revenue, a decrease of 27% sequentially and an increase of 3% year over year. EMEA contributed $457 million or 31% of total revenue, down 6% sequentially and up 16% year over year. Asia Pacific generated $188 million or 13% of revenue and grew 37% from the prior quarter while growing 55% year over year.
 
 
 
 
 
Channel Mix
 
Direct revenue was 24% of Q1 revenue, flat sequentially and a 1% decrease year over year. Our indirect channel accounted for 76% of total revenue, an increase of 3% sequentially and 39% year over year.
 
Within the indirect channel, Arrow accounted for 15% of total revenue and Avnet contributed 11% of total revenue. Revenue from OEM customers, including IBM, Fujitsu and other OEM customers related to the Engenio acquisition was 15% of total revenue in Q1.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 16, 2011, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the second quarter ended October 28, 2011.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
H. . NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
 
 
 
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

Exhibit 99.1 PRESS RELEASE
 
 
 
NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, which ended October 28, 2011. Revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 totaled $1.507 billion compared to revenues of $1.251 billion for the same period one year ago.
Sunnyvale, Calif.November 16, 2011
For the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, GAAP net income was $165.6 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $175.4 million, or $0.45 per share, for the same period a year ago. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 was $235.5 million, or $0.63 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $212.2 million, or $0.54 per share, for the same period a year ago.

Revenues for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $2.965 billion compared to revenues of $2.405 billion for the first six months of the prior fiscal year, an increase of 23% year over year. GAAP net income for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $305.1 million, or $0.78 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $326.1 million, or $0.85 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 totaled $457.8 million, or $1.17 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $403.1 million, or $1.05 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year.
 "NetApp produced record non-GAAP earnings per share in the second quarter. In aggregate, we saw strong revenue growth across most areas of our business, offset by some unexpected weakness in a handful of our largest accounts," said Tom Georgens, president and CEO. "NetApp achieved the highest number of net new customer wins in more than two and a half years this quarter, and in our 'Smart Decisions are Built on NetApp' campaign we just launched the new FAS2000 series platform built on our Data ONTAP 8.1 operating system-all of which will drive market share gains going forward."

Safe Harbor Statement Under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasted operating results, share count, and metrics for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012, as well as our expectations regarding our future market share and regarding our partnerships and strategic alliances and the benefits that we expect our customers to realize from using our products and from our strategic alliances and partnerships. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, general macroeconomic and market conditions, ; the effects of the flooding in Thailand; customer demand for our products and services, including our recently announced new product introductions and other important factors described in NetApp reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections titled Risk Factors in our most recently submitted Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Safe Harbor Statement
These prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, including the statements under the Q3 FY12 outlook section Actual results may differ materially from our statements or projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, general macroeconomic and market conditions, ; the effects of the flooding in Thailand; customer demand for our products and services, including our recently announced new product introductions and other important factors described in NetApp reports and documents filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections titled Risk Factors in our most recently submitted Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively.

regarding
our forecasted financial performance and share count for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. 
particularly the
continuing fiscal challenges in the U.S. and Europe
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between our non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the tables at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
 
 
Q2 Fiscal Year 2012
 
Revenue
 
Net revenue for the second quarter was $1.507 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and 20% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on revenue on a sequential basis while having a positive impact of just under two percentage points on a year over year basis.
2
 
Product revenue was $1.016 billion, growing 5% sequentially and 23% year over year.  Product revenue accounted for 67% of net revenue, up from 66% of net revenue in the prior quarter.
 
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and is recognized over the related contract period, was $198 million or 13% of net revenue. SEM revenue was flat on a quarter over quarter basis while increasing 12% year over year.
 
Service revenue of $293 million decreased 1% on a sequential basis and increased 17% year over year.
 
 
 
Sequential growth calculations are based upon Q1 FY12 results which can be found at investors.netapp.com

Foreign currency effects represent the changes in the average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
 
 
 
Gross Margin
 
Operating Expenses
 
 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $654 million were essentially flat compared to Q1 spending levels, but grew 15% year over year. Q2 operating expenses were 43% of net revenue, compared to 45% of net revenue in the first quarter.
 
In Q2 we added 346 net new employees for a total global headcount of 11,834.
 
Q2 GAAP operating expenses included $57 million in stock-based compensation, up from $53 million in Q1, $8 million in amortization of intangible assets and $2 million in acquisition related expenses for Engenio integration activities.
 
 
 
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $279 million or 18.5% of net revenue in Q2 and represents an increase of 4% sequentially and 9% year over year.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $3 million. GAAP other expenses, net includes approximately $12 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $282 million, or 18.7%, of net revenue in Q2, compared to 18.7% of net revenue in Q1 and 20.6% of net revenue in Q2 last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.4%.
Net Income
 
Non-GAAP net income was $236 million, or $0.63 per share. GAAP net income was $166 million, or $0.44 per share. Our diluted share count decreased by approximately 30 million shares from prior quarter to approximately 376 million shares in Q2, primarily due to share repurchases and lower than expected dilutive impact from our convertible notes and related warrants.
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
 
3
 
80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.
 
 
 
 
 
For Q2, our diluted share count was approximately 376 million, lower than our guidance of approximately 392 million. With an average stock price of $38.25 during Q2, the convertible notes had a less dilutive of an impact on our share count than expected. Since the average stock price was below the $41.28 conversion price of the warrants, there was no impact from warrants this quarter.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q2, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 6 million shares.
Select Balance Sheet Items
 
Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments were $4.642 billion at the end of Q2 and represent a decrease of approximately $72 million, a decline of 2% sequentially and an increase of 6% year over year. These cash figures include the impact of the $400 million spent on share repurchases this quarter and $93 million for capital purchases. 48% of the Q2 cash balance was held in the US. Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.439 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially and 25% year over year.
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $370 million, an increase of 54% quarter over quarter and 4% year over year. Capital expenditures were $93 million, a decrease of $5 million from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $277 million or 18% of revenue and grew 95% from Q1 levels while declining 11% from Q2 last year.
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventory.
5
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.
6
 
 
 
 
Q3 FY12 Outlook
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and market conditions. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $41.84 for the first 10 days of our third quarter. We estimate share count for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 will increase slightly to approximately 380 million shares, including an estimated 9 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes and 0.5 million shares from outstanding warrants. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedge that is expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would offset approximately 7 million shares if the conversion or maturity were to occur in the third quarter.
 
 
 
 
 
Other Business Metrics
 
Geographic Mix
 
Americas contributed $897 million or 60% of revenue, an increase of 10% sequentially and 19% year over year. The Americas number includes the U.S. commercial sector and the U.S. public sector. The U.S. commercial sector contributed $635 million or 42% of revenue, a decrease of 2% sequentially and an increase of 24% year over year. The U.S. public sector generated $262 million or 18% of revenue, an increase of 56% sequentially and an increase of 9% year over year.

Asia Pacific generated $181 million or 12% of revenue, decreasing 4% from the prior quarter while growing 55% year over year.
 
 
 
 
 
Pathways Mix

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 15, 2012, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the third quarter ended January 27, 2012.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expense.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
 
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
H. . NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
 
 
 
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our Company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure Company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure Company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Exhibit 99.2 SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY
 
 
 
This supplemental commentary is provided concurrently with our earnings press release to allow for additional time to review and analyze supplemental data prior to the companys earnings call. This information will not be read during the live call.
 
Safe Harbor Statement
These prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, including the statements under the Q4 FY12 outlook section Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including general economic and market conditions such as the flooding in Thailand, and matters specific to our business such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services. These and other equally important factors are described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections titled Risk Factors in our most recently submitted Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
regarding
our forecasts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. 
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between our non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the tables at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.
 
 
 
Q3 Fiscal Year 2012
 
Revenue
Net revenue for the third quarter was $1.566 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and 21% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations had a less than half percent unfavorable impact on our sequential results while increasing year over year results by approximately one percentage point.
2
Product revenue grew to $1.063 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially and 26% year over year. Product revenue was 68% of net revenue in Q3, up from 67% of net revenue in Q2.
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and recognized over the related contract period, was $204 million or 13% of net revenue. SEM revenue grew 3% sequentially and 11% year over year.
In Q3 service revenue was $299 million, an increase of 2% sequentially and 14% year over year.  Service revenue was 19% of total revenue, remaining flat from the prior quarter.
 
 
 
Sequential growth calculations are based upon Q2 FY12 results which can be found at investors.netapp.com

2
 
Foreign currency effects represent the changes in the average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the comparative prior periods (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period actual net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.
 
 
 
Gross Margin
Operating Expenses
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $671 million, an increase of 3% sequentially and 15% year over year. Q3 operating expenses were 43% of net revenue, essentially flat to the prior quarter.
In the third quarter, our headcount increased by 268 net new employees for a total global headcount of 12,102.
GAAP operating expenses included $69 million in non-cash stock-based compensation of which $11 million was related to the reset of the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) offerings triggered by the decline in our stock price below the grant date price. Additional GAAP operating items were $8 million in amortization of intangible assets and $4 million in acquisition-related expenses for Engenio integration activities.
 
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $258 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially and 4% year over year. Operating margin was 16.5% of Q3 net revenue.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $3 million. GAAP other expenses, net includes approximately $14 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $262 million, or 16.7% of net revenue in Q3, compared to 18.7% of net revenue in the prior quarter and 21.2% of net revenue in Q3 last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.4%.
Net Income
Non-GAAP net income totaled $216 million, or $0.58 per share. GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.32 per share and was negatively impacted by the reset of the ESPP grants. Q3 diluted share count was 374 million, a decrease of approximately 2 million shares from the prior quarter.
 
 
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q3, our diluted share count was approximately 374 million, lower than our guidance of approximately 380 million. Our average stock price was $37.31 during the third quarter. Since the average stock price was below the $41.28 conversion price of the warrants, there was no impact from warrants this quarter.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q3, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares.
 
Select Balance Sheet Items
Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments ended the quarter with a balance of $4.866 billion, an increase of $225 million from Q2. This growth represents an increase of 5% sequentially and 2% year over year.
 
Similar to last quarter, 49% of our Q3 cash balance was held in the US. Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.546 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and 23% year over year.

80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventory.
5
 
 
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
 
 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $269 million, a decrease of 27% sequentially and 24% year over year. Capital expenditures were $91 million, a decrease of $2 million from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $178 million or 11% of revenue. Free cash flow declined 36% from Q2 levels and 38% year over year.
 
Q4 FY12 Outlook
 
This forecast is based on current business expectations and market conditions. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $39.43 for the first 10 days of our fourth quarter. We estimate share count for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 will increase slightly to approximately 378 million shares, including an estimated 8 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedge that is expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would offset approximately 6 million shares if the conversion or maturity were to occur in the fourth quarter.
 
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 26, 2012, NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp") terminated one of its existing synthetic leasing arrangements with BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation ("BNPPLC") for the Moffett Business Center in Sunnyvale, California (the "Property") by exercising its option under the Purchase Agreement (as defined below) to purchase the Property from BNPPLC. Prior to the termination of the arrangement, NetApp leased the Property from BNPPLC for a term expiring in December 2012. In connection with the termination, NetApp repaid the outstanding lease balance of approximately $80 million and purchased the Property. As a result of the termination, NetApp incurred a total loss of approximately $36 million, which is the difference between the lease obligation of approximately $80 million and the Property's fair value of approximately $44 million, determined at the date of termination. A $32 million loss had been accrued prior to the date of the lease termination and, as a result, NetApp will record an additional lease termination loss of approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. BNPPLC's rights, title and interest in and to the Synthetic Lease Agreements (as defined below) were terminated and reverted back to NetApp. NetApp's future real estate lease payments will be reduced by a total of approximately $80 million for the lease periods through fiscal 2013. No early termination penalties were incurred by NetApp as a result of this termination.
The term "Synthetic Lease Agreements" used herein includes the following agreements between NetApp and BNPPLC that reflect the synthetic leasing arrangement for the Property, all of which have been previously filed:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Item 2.04 Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 23, 2012, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended April 27, 2012.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expenses.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
 
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
H.. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
 
 
 
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

Year over Year Overview
 
Fiscal year 2012 net revenue was $6.23 billion, an increase of 22% over fiscal year 2011, driven primarily by increased product revenues. Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.9%, reflecting the addition of the lower margin E-Series OEM revenues.
 
Revenue growth of 22% year over year outpaced non-GAAP operating expense growth of 15%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.8% for fiscal year 2012. Profitability gains are reflected in the 10% year over year increase in non-GAAP net income per share.
 
 
 
 
 
Q4 Fiscal Year 2012
 
Revenue
Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,703 million, an increase of 9% sequentially and 19% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact on revenue, on both a sequential and a year over year basis.

Product revenue grew to $1,165 million, an increase of 10% sequentially and 21% year over year. Product revenue was 68% of net revenue in Q4, similar to the prior quarter.
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and recognized over the related contract period, was $213 million or 13% of net revenue. SEM revenue grew 4% sequentially and 14% year over year.
Service revenue was $325 million, an increase of 9% sequentially and 16% year over year. Service revenue was 19% of total revenue, similar to the prior quarter.

Gross Margin
 
Operating Expenses
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $709 million, an increase of 6% sequentially and 7% year over year. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 were 42% of net revenue, compared to 43% reported in the prior quarter.
In the fourth quarter, our headcount increased by 47 net new employees for a total global headcount of 12,149.
GAAP operating expenses included $55 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, down from $69 million in the prior quarter. Additional GAAP operating items were $7 million in amortization of intangible assets and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses for Engenio integration activities.
 
 
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $305 million, an increase of 18% sequentially and 12% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.9% of Q4 net revenue.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $7 million. GAAP other expenses, net includes approximately $14 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $312 million, or 18.3% of net revenue in Q4, compared to 16.7% of net revenue in the prior quarter and 19.7% of net revenue in Q4 last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 19.0%.
Net Income
Non-GAAP net income totaled $252 million, or $0.66 per share. GAAP net income was $181 million or $0.47 per share. The Q4 diluted share count was 382 million shares, an increase of approximately 8 million shares from the prior quarter.
 
 
 
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q4, our diluted share count was approximately 382 million, slightly higher than our guidance of approximately 378 million. With an average stock price of $41.97 during the fourth quarter, both the convertible notes and warrants had a dilutive impact on our share count.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q4, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 8 million shares.
Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.

Select Balance Sheet Items
Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments ended the quarter with a balance of $5.4 billion, an increase of $532 million from Q3. This growth represents an increase of 11% sequentially and 4% year over year.
Similar to last quarter, 50% of our Q4 cash and investments balance was held in the U.S. Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.8 billion, an increase of 11% sequentially and 22% year over year.
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $583 million, up $314 million from last quarter, and up 27% from Q4 last year. Capital expenditures were $124 million, an increase of $33 million from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $458 million or 27% of revenue. Free cash flow increased $280 million from Q3 and was up 19% from Q4 last year.
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.

Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventories.
5
 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Q1 FY13 Outlook
NetApps outlook reflects the normal slower seasonality of the first quarter and the increasing uncertainty in the broader macro environment. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $38.11 for the first 10 days of our first quarter of fiscal year 2013. We estimate share count for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 will decrease slightly to approximately 380 million shares including  an estimated 7 million shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedge that is expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would offset approximately 5 million shares if the conversion or maturity were to occur in the first quarter.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On August 15, 2012, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the first quarter ended July 27, 2012.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expenses.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
 
 
2
 
 
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
 
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
H.. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

Our global headcount increased to approximately 12,450 at the end of Q1.
GAAP operating expenses included $72 million in stock-based compensation, up from $55 million in Q4, and $7 million in amortization of intangible assets.

Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $181 million, a decrease of 41% sequentially and 33% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 12.5% of Q1 net revenue.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $8 million.  GAAP other expenses, net includes approximately $14 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $189 million, or 13.1% of net revenue in Q1, compared to 18.3% of net revenue in the prior quarter and 18.7% of net revenue in Q1 last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.3%.
Net Income
Non-GAAP net income was $156 million, or $0.42 per share. GAAP net income was $64 million, or $0.17 per share. Our diluted share count was 371 million shares, a decrease of 11 million shares from the prior quarter.

Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q1, diluted share count was approximately 371 million, lower than our previous guidance of approximately 380 million. With an average share price of $31.97 during our first quarter, the convertible notes had a less dilutive impact on our share count than expected. Since the average stock price was below the $41.28 conversion price of the warrants, there was no share count impact from warrants this quarter.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q1, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 160 thousand shares.  Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.
Select Balance Sheet Items
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was $5.44 billion at the end of Q1, an increase of $43 million from Q4. This growth represents an increase of 1% sequentially and 15% year over year. Of our cash, cash equivalents and investment balance, 47% was held in the U.S. Our balance sheet reflects a total deferred revenue balance of $2.77 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially and an increase of 16% year over year.

Select Cash Flow Statement Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $229 million, down 61% sequentially and 5% year over year. Capital expenditures were $62 million, a decline of 50% from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $167 million or 12% of revenue.
Q2 FY13 Outlook
This forecast is based on current business expectations and market conditions and continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Dilutive share count includes the impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $32.44 for the first 10 days of our second quarter. We estimate share count for the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 will decrease to approximately 370 million shares, including an estimated 700 thousand shares from the Companys outstanding convertible notes. Share count does not include the Companys outstanding note hedge that is expected to offset 80% of the dilution from the convertible notes at maturity or conversion, which would offset approximately 560 thousand shares if the conversion or maturity were to occur in the second quarter.
 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

A written waiver of notice, signed by the person entitled thereto, whether before or after the time of the meeting stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
 
Section 3.9.

Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
Section 3.15. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of shares entitled to vote at an election of directors.
Section 4.1. Whenever, under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any director or stockholder, it shall not be construed to mean personal notice (except as provided in Section 7 of Article III of these Bylaws), but such notice may be given in writing, by mail, addressed to such director or stockholder, at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Notice to directors may also be given by telephone, telegram or facsimile.
Section 4.2. Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.

Any of or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he/she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

Section 6.4. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 6.5. The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
Section 7.1. Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law.

Section 7.2. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the directors from time to time, in their absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purposes as the directors shall think conducive to the interest of the corporation, and the directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
 
Section 7.3. All checks or demands for money and notes of the corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.

Section 7.5. The Board of Directors may adopt a corporate seal having inscribed thereon the name of the corporation, the year of its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware."

Section 7.6. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent authorized under the laws of the State of Delaware, as those laws may be amended and supplemented from time to time, indemnify any director made, or threatened to be made, a party to an action or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, by reason of being a director of the corporation or a predecessor corporation or, at the corporation's request, a director or officer of another corporation, provided, however, that the corporation shall indemnify any such agent in connection with a proceeding initiated by such agent only if such proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The indemnification provided for in this Section 6 shall: (i) not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those indemnified may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement or vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in their official capacities and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, (ii) continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, and (iii) inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The corporation's obligation to provide indemnification under this Section 6 shall be offset to the extent of any other source of indemnification or any otherwise applicable insurance coverage under a policy maintained by the corporation or any other person.
Expenses incurred by a director of the corporation in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he is or was a director of the corporation (or was serving at the corporation's request as a director or officer of another corporation) shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized by relevant sections of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation shall not be required to advance such expenses to an agent who is a party to an action, suit or proceeding brought by the corporation and approved by a majority of
 
the Board of Directors of the corporation which alleges willful misappropriation of corporate assets by such agent, disclosure of confidential information in violation of such agent's fiduciary or contractual obligations to the corporation or any other willful and deliberate breach in bad faith of such agent's duty to the corporation or its stockholders.
The foregoing provisions of this Section 6 shall be deemed to be a contract between the corporation and each director who serves in such capacity at any time while this Bylaw is in effect, and any repeal or modification thereof shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts.
The Board of Directors in its discretion shall have power on behalf of the corporation to indemnify any person, other than a director, made a party to any action, suit or proceeding by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate, is or was an officer or employee of the corporation.
To assure indemnification under this Section 6 of all directors, officers and employees who are determined by the corporation or otherwise to be or to have been "fiduciaries" of any employee benefit plan of the corporation which may exist from time to time, Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall, for the purposes of this Section 6, be interpreted as follows: an "other enterprise" shall be deemed to include such an employee benefit plan, including without limitation, any plan of the corporation which is governed by the Act of Congress entitled "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974," as amended from time to time; the corporation shall be deemed to have requested a person to serve an employee benefit plan where the performance by such person of his duties to the corporation also imposes duties on, or otherwise involves services by, such person to the plan or participants or beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan pursuant to such Act of Congress shall be deemed "fines."
Section 8.1. These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed or new Bylaws may be adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% vote of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation. These Bylaws may also be altered, amended or repealed or new Bylaws may be adopted by the Board of Directors, when such power is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation. The foregoing may occur at any regular meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors or at any special meeting of the stockholders or of the Board of Directors if notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the notice of such special meeting. If the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws is conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation it shall not divest or limit the power of the stockholders to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.
 
The undersigned, Matthew K. Fawcett, hereby certifies that he is the duly elected and acting Secretary of NetApp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), and that the Bylaws attached hereto constitute the Bylaws of said Corporation as duly adopted by the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Corporation and as in effect on the date hereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has hereunto subscribed his name this 31st day of August, 2012.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On November 14, 2012, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the second quarter ended October 26, 2012.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expenses.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
 
 
2
 
 
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G.These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.  
 
H.. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.
Item 7.01     Regulation FD Disclosure.
On November 14, 2012, the Companys board of directors approved an increase of $1.5 to its stock repurchase program. Under this program, the Company may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions under this program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations, and regulatory requirements. The purchases will be funded from available working capital.
The information in this Item 7.01 shall be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act and shall be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

GAAP net income for the first six months of fiscal year 2013 totaled $173 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to GAAP net income of $305 million, or $0.78 per share for the first six months of the prior fiscal year.

NetApp produced healthy financial results in the second quarter with revenue roughly at the midpoint of and EPS above our guidance range, despite a difficult environment. We saw a strong uptake of NetApp Data ONTAP 8 and clustered Data ONTAP, as customers are looking to build agile data infrastructure environments with intelligent data management, nearly unlimited scalability, and nondisruptive operations, said Tom Georgens, president and CEO. We also saw momentum in our partnering strategy with continued FlexPod growth and a record high revenue contribution from Arrow and Avnet. Our focus on delivering best-of-breed storage solutions and the leverage we gain through go-to-market and channel partners will enable NetApp to grow our business and gain share.
NetApp also announces it will continue its share repurchase program with an additional $1.5 billion authorized. Under this program, NetApp can purchase shares of its outstanding common stock through open market and in privately negotiated transactions at prices deemed appropriate by management.

Safe Harbor Statement Under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasts for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, the benefits to us and our customers of our products and services, the expected benefits of partnerships and alliances, and our statements regarding future repurchases of our common stock, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including general economic and market conditions, and the continuing deliberations regarding future tax and fiscal policy in the U.S.; and matters specific to our business, such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services. These and other equally important factors are described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections titled Risk Factors in our most recently submitted Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our Company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
 
 
10
 
 
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure Company performance against historical
results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure Company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Our global headcount increased to approximately 12,650 at the end of Q2 up from 12,450 at the end of Q1.
GAAP operating expenses included $59 million in stock-based compensation, down from $72 million in Q1, and $8 million in amortization of intangible assets.

Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $222 million, an increase of 23% sequentially and a decrease of 20% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 14.4% of Q2 net revenue.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $7 million. GAAP other expenses, net includes approximately $14 million of non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $229 million, or 14.8% of net revenue in Q2, compared to 13.1% of net revenue in the prior quarter and 18.7% of net revenue in Q2 last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.3%.
Net Income
Non-GAAP net income was $189 million, or $0.51 per share. GAAP net income was $110 million, or $0.30 per share. Our diluted share count was 368 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million shares from the prior quarter.

Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q2, diluted share count was approximately 368 million, lower than our previous guidance of approximately 370 million. With an average share price of $32.65 during our second quarter, the convertible notes had a minimal impact on our share count. Since the average stock price was below the $41.28 conversion price of the warrants, there was no share count impact from the warrants this quarter.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q2, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 800 thousand shares. Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.
Select Balance Sheet Items
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $5.57 billion at the end of Q2, an increase of $130 million from Q1 and $929 million from Q2 last year. Of our cash, cash equivalents and investment balance, 44% was held in the U.S. At the end of Q2, total deferred revenue balance was $2.77 billion, flat from Q1 and up $332 million from Q2 last year.

Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventories.

Select Cash Flow Statement Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $336 million, an increase of 47% sequentially and a decrease of 9% year over year. Capital expenditures were $67 million, an increase of 8% from last quarter. Free cash flow totaled $269 million or 17% of revenue.
Q3 FY13 Outlook
This outlook is based on current business expectations and market conditions and continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Dilutive share count includes the estimated impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $27.66 for the first 8 trading days of our third quarter. We estimate share count for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 will decrease to approximately 365 million shares. Since the average stock price is below the $31.85 strike price for the convertible notes, the Q3 share count outlook does not include any estimate for the dilution associated with the Companys outstanding note hedge.
 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expenses, acquisition related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our convertible debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Covenants of the Underwriters
 
8. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each affiliate of any Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto, or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use therein.
Indemnity and Contribution
(b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such Underwriter, but only with reference to information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 8(a) or 8(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the Managers authorized to appoint counsel under this Section set forth in Schedule I hereto, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 8(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 8(a) or 8(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 8(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 8(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the
 
Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Securities as set forth in the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Securities they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.
(e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 8(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 8(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 8 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of any Underwriter or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Securities.
 
9. . The Underwriters may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market, (ii) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on the NASDAQ Global Market, (iii) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (iv) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (v) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your reasonable judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (v), makes it, in your reasonable judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Time of Sale Prospectus or the Prospectus.
Termination
10. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness; Defaulting Underwriters
If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it has or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase is not more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated severally in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in Schedule II bears to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as you may specify, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date; that in no event shall the principal amount of Securities that any Underwriter has agreed to purchase pursuant to this Agreement be increased pursuant to this Section 10 by an amount in excess of one-ninth of such principal amount of Securities without the written consent of such Underwriter. If, on the Closing Date, any Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to you and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company. In any such case either you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required
provided
 
changes, if any, in the Registration Statement, in the Time of Sale Prospectus, in the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriters, or any of them, because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions contained in Section 5 of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement the Company will reimburse the Underwriters or such Underwriters as have so terminated this Agreement with respect to themselves, severally, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by such Underwriters in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
11. . (a) This Agreement represents the entire agreement between the Company and the Underwriters with respect to the preparation of any preliminary prospectus, the Time of Sale Prospectus, the Prospectus, the conduct of the offering, and the purchase and sale of the Securities.
Entire Agreement
(b) The Company acknowledges that in connection with the offering of the Securities: (i) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Company or any other person, (ii) the Underwriters owe the Company only those duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement and prior written agreements (to the extent not superseded by this Agreement), if any, and (iii) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Company. The Company waives to the full extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offering of the Securities.
12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
Counterparts
13. . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On December 12, 2012, NetApp, Inc. ("NetApp") entered into an indenture (the "Base Indenture") and a first supplemental indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture" and referred to together with the Base Indenture as the "Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, to establish the terms and form of those certain senior unsecured notes issued by NetApp in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion (collectively, the "Notes"). The Notes consist of the following tranches: $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior unsecured notes due 2017, and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022. Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2013.
NetApp previously entered into an Underwriting Agreement dated December 5, 2012 in connection with the sale of the Notes, as described further in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by NetApp with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on December 5, 2012. The Notes were offered and sold under NetApp's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-185217) filed with the SEC on November 30, 2012.
NetApp intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include repayment of certain indebtedness, capital expenditures, possible stock repurchases, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions. NetApp may also be required to offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change in control and a contemporaneous downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating, and it may elect to redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time, as further specified in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains limited affirmative and negative covenants of NetApp. The negative covenants restrict the ability of NetApp and its subsidiaries to incur debt secured by liens on its principal property or on shares of stock or indebtedness of its subsidiaries that own principal property; to engage in sale and lease-back transactions with respect to any principal property; and to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.
Events of default under the Indenture include a failure to make payments, non-performance of affirmative and negative covenants, and the occurrence of bankruptcy and insolvency-related events. NetApp's obligations may be accelerated upon an event of default, in which case the entire principal amount of the Notes would become immediately due and payable.
The foregoing description of certain terms of the Indenture does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture, which are filed with this report as Exhibit 4.1 and Exhibit 4.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, counsel to NetApp, has issued an opinion to NetApp dated December 12, 2012 regarding the legality of the Notes. A copy of the opinion is filed as Exhibit 5.1 hereto.

In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of the applicant's Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Security and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any Officer. Upon the issuance of any substituted Security, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. In case any Security that has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company, instead of issuing a substitute Security, may pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and, in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Every replacement Security issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07 shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder. All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies, notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.08 .
Cancellation
All Securities surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent, shall be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On written request of the Company at the time of such surrender, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Securities held by the Trustee. If the Company shall otherwise acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.09 .
Benefits of Indenture
Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and the holders of the Securities, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained;
 
all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the holders of the Securities.
Section 2.10 .
Authenticating Agent
So long as any of the Securities of any series remain Outstanding, there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which the Trustee shall have the right to appoint. The Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series, including Securities issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this Indenture to the authentication of Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for such series. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus, as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with these provisions, it shall resign immediately. Any Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee at any time may, and upon request by the Company shall, terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent pursuant hereto.

CUSIP Numbers
The Company in issuing the Securities of a series may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Securityholders; provided that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that
 
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
Section 2.13 .
Securities Denominated in Foreign Currencies
Except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.01 for Securities of any series, payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, Securities of such series denominated in any Foreign Currency will be made in such Foreign Currency.
In the event any Foreign Currency or Currencies in which any payment with respect to any series of Securities may be made ceases to be a freely convertible Currency on United States Currency markets, for any date thereafter on which payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities of a series is due, the Company shall select the Currency of payment for use on such date, all as provided in the Securities of such series, in a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. In such event, the Company shall notify the Trustee of the Currency which it has selected to constitute the funds necessary to meet the Company's obligations on such payment date and of the amount of such Currency to be paid. Such amount shall be determined as provided in the Securities of such series, in a Board Resolution or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto. The payment with respect to such payment date shall be deposited with the Trustee by the Company solely in the Currency so selected.
Section 2.14 .
Wire Transfers
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Indenture, the Company may make any payment required to be deposited with the Trustee on account of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Securities by any method of wire transfer to an account designated in writing by the Trustee such that funds are available on or before 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date such payment is to be made to the Holders of the Securities in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 2.15 .

(a) the obligation, if any, of the Company to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of any series in a Foreign Currency or Dollars (the "") as may be specified pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(12) is of the essence and agree that, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, judgments in respect of Securities of such series shall be given in the Designated Currency;
Designated Currency
(b) the obligation of the Company to make payments in the Designated Currency of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Securities shall be discharged, notwithstanding any payment in any other Currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), only to the extent of the amount in the Designated Currency that the Securityholder receiving such payment, in accordance with normal banking procedures, may purchase with the amount paid in such other Currency after any premium and cost of exchange on the business day in the country of issue of the Designated Currency or in the international banking community immediately following the day on which such Securityholder receives such payment;
 
(c) if the amount in the Designated Currency that may be so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due, the Company shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such shortfall; and
(d) any obligation of the Company not discharged by such payment shall be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect.
Section 3.01 .
Redemption
The Company may redeem the Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01.
Section 3.02 .
Notice of Redemption
(a) If the Company desires to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series, the Company shall, or shall instruct the Trustee in writing to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid, a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register (unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed). Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction.
Each such notice of redemption shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall state that: (i) payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, or, if none, at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, upon presentation and surrender of such Securities; (ii) interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said notice; (iii) from and after said date interest will cease to accrue; (iv) the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case, and (v) the CUSIP and/or other similar number as contemplated by, and containing the disclaimers and other language contemplated by, Section 2.12. If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed in whole or in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed. In case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
 
(b) If all or less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 15 days' written notice (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) in advance of the date the Company gives notice to the Securityholders of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the series to be redeemed. If less than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee thereupon shall select from Securities of such series Outstanding not previously called for redemption, in accordance with a method determined by the Trustee (in such manner as complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any) and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of the principal amount of such Securities of such series of a denomination larger than $2,000, the Securities of such series to be redeemed. The Trustee promptly shall notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities of such series to be redeemed, in whole or in part.
The Company, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by any of its Officers, may instruct the Trustee or any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the manner set forth in this Section 3.02, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name, as the Trustee or such paying agent may deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section 3.02.
Section 3.03 .
Payment Upon Redemption
(a) If the giving of notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, in each case as established pursuant to Section 2.01. Interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, such Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided, that, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable to the Securityholders of such Securities (or one or more Predecessor Securities) registered as such at the close of business on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.03.
(b) Upon presentation of any Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute a new Security of the same series and tenor of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented and the Trustee shall authenticate, and the office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, such Security; except that if a Global Security is so surrendered, the Company shall execute a new Global Security of like tenor in a denomination equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Global Security so surrendered and, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate requesting authentication and delivery, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Depositary for such Global Security, without service charge, such Global Security.
Section 3.04 .

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment," and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment." If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.

Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.06 .
Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund
Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series pursuant to the terms of the series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the Currency in which the Securities of such series are denominated (except as provided pursuant to Section 2.01), the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for such credit. Together with such Officer's Certificate, the Company will deliver to the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 15 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02 and cause notice of the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02. Such notice having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.
The following covenants shall apply to the Securities, except with respect to any series of Securities for which the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series expressly provides that any such covenant shall not apply to such series of Securities:
Section 4.01 .
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest

Such designation will continue with respect to each office or agency until the Company, by written notice signed by any Officer and delivered to the Trustee, shall designate some other office or agency for such purposes or any of them. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all presentations, surrenders, notices and demands. Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 2.01 with respect to a series of Securities, the Company initially designates the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,acting as the Company's agent, as the office to be maintained by it for each such purpose.

Paying Agents
(a) The Company may appoint one or more paying agents, other than the Trustee, for all or any series of the Securities. If the Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as paying agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any of their Subsidiaries may act as paying agent.
(b) The Company shall require each paying agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the paying agent will hold in trust for the benefit of Securityholders or the Trustee all funds held by the paying agent for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities, and will promptly notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a paying agent to pay all funds held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a paying agent to pay all funds held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the paying agent (including the Company or any of their Subsidiaries serving as the paying agent) shall have no further liability for the funds. If the Company or any of their Subsidiaries acts as paying agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the Securityholders all funds held by it as paying agent.
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, (i) the agreement to hold funds in trust as provided in this Section 4.03 is subject to the provisions of Section 11.06, and (ii) the Company at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge or defeasance of this Indenture or for any other purpose, may pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all funds held in trust by the Company or such paying agent, such funds to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such funds were held by the Company or such paying agent. Upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such funds.
Section 4.04 .
Statement by Officers as to Default
 
So long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, a brief certificate (which need not comply with Section 13.06) executed by any two Officers of the Company, one of which shall be the principal executive, financial or accounting officer of the Company, on its behalf as to the Officer's respective knowledge of the Company's compliance with all covenants and agreements under this Indenture required to be complied with by the Company (such compliance to be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this Indenture).

Section 5.04 .
Reports by the Trustee

(b) A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to Securityholders, be filed by the Trustee with the Company, with any stock exchange upon which any Securities are listed and with the Commission.

Section 6.01 .
Events of Default
(a) Whenever used herein with respect to Securities of a particular series, "Event of Default" means any one or more of the following events that has occurred and is continuing, except with respect to any series of Securities for which the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series expressly provides that any such Event of Default shall not apply to such series of Securities:
(1) default in the payment of the principal or any premium on any Security of that series when due (whether at maturity, upon acceleration, redemption or otherwise);
(2) default for 30 days in the payment of interest on any Security of such series when due;
(3) failure by the Company to observe or perform any term of the Indenture (other than those referred to in (1) or (2) above and other than a covenant or agreement included in this Indenture not for the benefit of such series) for a period of 60 days after the Company receives a notice of default stating that the Company is in breach. The notice must be sent by either the Trustee or Holders of not less than 25% of the principal amount of the Securities of the affected series;
(4) the entry by a court having competent jurisdiction of:
(A) an order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law and such order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or
(B) a final and non-appealable order appointing a Custodian, of the Company, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of the affairs of the Company, and such order shall remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days;
(5) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law or the consent by the Company to the entry of a decree or order for relief in an involuntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law or the filing by the Company of a consent to an order for relief in any involuntary proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law or to the appointment of a Custodian or the making by the Company of an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or
 
(6) any other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture or resolution of the Board of Directors under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series.
(b) In each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) or 6.01(a)(5)), unless the principal of all the Securities of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the unpaid principal of all the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a)(4) or 6.01(a)(5) occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
(c) At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the amount due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Company has or has caused to be paid or deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series to the date of such payment or deposit), and (ii) any and all Events of Default under this Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series that shall have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06.
No such rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d) In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceedings, the Company and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
(e) The Trustee shall give to the Securityholders of any series, as the names and addresses of such Holders appear on the Security Register, notice by mail of all defaults known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee that have occurred with respect to such series, such notice to be transmitted within 90 days after the occurrence thereof, unless such defaults shall have been cured before the giving of such notice (the term "default" or "defaults" for the purposes of this Section 6.01(e) being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such
 
notice if and so long as its board of directors, executive committee, or trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.
Section 6.02 .
Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee
(a) The Company covenants that (i) in case it shall default in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of a series, or any payment required by any sinking or analogous fund established with respect to that series as and when the same shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days, or (ii) in case it shall default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, on any of the Securities of a series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of a series or upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise, then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have been become due and payable on all such Securities for principal, premium, if any, or interest, or both, with interest upon the overdue principal, premium, if any, and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) upon overdue installments of interest at the rate expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06.
(b) If the Company shall fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the amounts so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company and collect the amounts adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, wherever situated.
(c) In case of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, readjustment, arrangement, composition or judicial proceedings affecting the Company or its respective creditors or property, the Trustee shall have power to intervene in such proceedings and take any action therein that may be permitted by the court and, except as otherwise provided by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other papers and documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for the entire amount due and payable by the Company under this Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional amount that may become due and payable by the Company after such date, and to collect and receive any funds or other property payable or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same in accordance with Section 6.03. Any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Securities of such series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06.
(d) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that series, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative thereto. Any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series.
 
In case of an Event of Default, the Trustee in its discretion may proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.
Section 6.03 .
Application of Funds Collected
Any funds collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article VI with respect to a particular series of Securities shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such funds on account of principal, premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the Securities of that series, and notation thereon the payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of costs and expenses of collection and of all amounts payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06;
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon Securities of such series for principal, premium, if any, and interest, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such funds have been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, respectively; and
THIRD: To the Company.
Section 6.04 .
Limitation on Suits
No holder of any Security of any series shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless (i) such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof with respect to the Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default; (ii) the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby; (iv) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; and (v) during such 60 day period, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then Outstanding do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any other provisions of this Indenture, the right of any holder of any Security to receive payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on such Security, as therein provided, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security (or in the
 
case of redemption, on the redemption date), or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates or redemption date, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder. By accepting a Security hereunder it is expressly understood, intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every Security of such series with every other such taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of Securities of such series shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other of such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Securities of such series. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this Section 6.04, each Securityholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.
Section 6.05 .
Rights and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission not Waiver
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.07, all powers and remedies given by this Article VI to the Trustee or to the Securityholders, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Securities, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture or otherwise established with respect to such Securities.
(b) No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or on acquiescence therein. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.04, every power and remedy given by this Article VI or by law to the Trustee or the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Securityholders.
Section 6.06 .
Control by Securityholders
The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture or be unduly prejudicial to the rights of holders of Securities of any other series at the time Outstanding determined in accordance with Section 8.04. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture and may decline to follow any such direction unless the holders shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, determined in accordance with Section 8.04, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series, may rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default with respect to such series and its consequences, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a default (i) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series; or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected. Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former
 
positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.07 .
Undertaking to Pay Costs
All parties to this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Securities by such holder's acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section 6.07 shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder, or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Security of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture.
Section 6.08 .
Waiver of Usury, Stay Or Extension Laws
Each of the Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.
Section 7.01 .
Certain Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee
(a) In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (that has not been cured or waived), the Trustee shall exercise with respect to Securities of that series such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

The Trustee shall notify the Company promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee so to notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Company has been prejudiced by such failure.

Section 7.07 .
Reliance on Officer's Certificate
Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect
 
thereof be herein specifically prescribed), in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 7.09 the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Company may not, nor may any Affiliate of the Company, serve as Trustee.

Section 7.10 .
Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor
(a) The Trustee or any successor hereafter appointed may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company and by transmitting notice of resignation by mail, first class postage prepaid, to the Securityholders of such series, as their names and addresses appear upon the Security Register. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Company promptly shall appoint a successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 60 days after the retiring Trustee resigns, the retiring Trustee, at the expense of the Company, or the Company may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to Securities of such series, or any Securityholder of that series who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.
(b) In case at any time any one of the following shall occur, the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to all or any series of Securities and appoint a successor trustee, or, unless the Trustee's duty to resign is stayed as provided herein, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months, on behalf of that holder and all others similarly situated, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor
 
trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 7.08 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six months; or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.09 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such Securityholder; or

Section 8.01 .
Evidence of Action by Securityholders
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities of that series in Person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series, provided, however, that the Company may not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 6.01, (iii) any request to institute proceedings referred to in Section 6.04 or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 6.06, in each case with respect to Securities of such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided, however, that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the
 
record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company's expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day as the "Expiration Date" and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided, however, that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 13.03, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable record date.
Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all or any part of such principal amount.
Section 8.02 .
Proof of Execution by Securityholders
Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
(a) The fact and date of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
(b) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
(c) The Trustee may require such additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
Section 8.03 .
Who May be Deemed Owners
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03) interest on such Security and for all other
 
purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
None of the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent or the Security Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.
Section 8.04 .
Certain Securities Owned by Company Disregarded
In determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent of waiver under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series or by an Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities of such series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not an Affiliate. In case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities of a particular series, if any known by the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above described Persons and, subject to Sections 7.01 and 7.02, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities of such particular series not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Section 8.05 .
Actions Binding on Future Securityholders
At any time prior to the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any holder of a Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have consented to such action, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, may revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor, on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the holders of all the Securities of that series.
Section 9.01 .

(g) to change or eliminate any of the provisions of this Indenture, provided that any such change or elimination shall not become effective with respect to any outstanding Security of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture which is entitled to the benefit of such provision;
(h) to secure the Securities of any series;
(i) to make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Securityholder of Outstanding Securities;

Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this Section 9.01 may be executed by the Company and the Trustee without the consent of the holders of any of the Securities at the time Outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 9.02.
Section 9.02 .
Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Securityholders
With the consent (evidenced as provided in Section 8.01) of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding affected by such supplemental indenture or indentures, the Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee from time to time and at any time may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto (which shall conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner not covered by Section 9.01 the rights of the holders of the Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security then Outstanding and affected thereby, shall

It shall not be necessary for the consent of Securityholders of a series affected thereby under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

Defeasance and Discharge of Obligations; Covenant Defeasance

(i) all such Securities of a particular series not heretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or that have not become due and payable as described in Section 11.02 shall have been paid by the Company by depositing irrevocably with the Trustee in trust funds or an amount of Governmental Obligations sufficient to pay at maturity or upon redemption all such Securities of that series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal, premium, if any, and interest due or to become due to such date of maturity or date fixed for redemption, as the case may be, and
 
(ii) the Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other amounts payable hereunder by the Company with respect to such series,
then, after the date such funds or Governmental Obligations, as the case may be, are deposited with the Trustee, the obligations of the Company under this Indenture with respect to such series shall cease to be of further effect except, to the extent applicable, for the following provisions that shall survive until such Securities shall mature and be paid: (A) the rights of Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 11.03(c) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when due, (B) the Company's obligation with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.07, 4.02, 4.03, 7.05 and 7.10 hereof, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article XI.

For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with respect to the Outstanding Securities of a series, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute an Event of Default under Section 6.01(a)(3) or otherwise, but except as specified in this Section 11.03(b), the remainder of the Company's obligations under the Securities of such series, this Indenture, and any indentures supplemental to this Indenture with respect to such series shall be unaffected thereby.

Exhibit 5.1
NetApp, Inc.

Sunnyvale, California 94089
 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special counsel to NetApp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on November 30, 2012 of a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration Statement"), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), that is automatically effective under the Act pursuant to Rule 462(e) promulgated thereunder. The Registration Statement relates to, among other things, the proposed issuance and sale, from time to time, by the Company of debt securities with an indeterminate amount as may at various times be issued at indeterminate prices, in reliance on Rule 456(b) and Rule 457(e) under the Act.
Under the Registration Statement, the Company has issued $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes") and $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "2022 Notes" and together with the 2017 Notes, the "Notes") pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of December 12, 2012 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December 12, 2012 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and the Base Indenture as so supplemented, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Notes were sold pursuant to an Underwriting Agreement, dated December 5, 2012 (the "Underwriting Agreement"), among the Company, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named in the Underwriting Agreement.
We have examined the Registration Statement, together with the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference therein; the base prospectus, dated November 30, 2012, together with the documents incorporated by reference therein, filed with the Registration Statement (the "Base Prospectus"); the preliminary prospectus supplement, dated December 5, 2012, in the form filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering of the Notes; the final prospectus supplement, dated December 5, 2012, in the form filed with Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act relating to the offering of the Notes (collectively with the Base Prospectus, the "Prospectus Supplement"); the Indenture and the Notes. In addition, we have examined such other instruments, documents, certificates and records which we have deemed relevant and necessary for the basis of our opinion hereinafter expressed. In such examination, we have assumed (i) the authenticity of original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (ii) the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; (iii) the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents, instruments and certificates we have reviewed; (iv) the Underwriting Agreement has been duly authorized and validly executed and delivered by the parties thereto (other than the Company); (v) the legal capacity of all natural persons; and (vi) that the Trustee has the power, corporate or other, to enter into and perform its obligations under the Indenture

and that the Indenture will be a valid and binding obligation of the Trustee. As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that were not independently established or verified, we have relied upon oral or written statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Company.
We express no opinion as to any matter relating to laws of any jurisdiction other than the federal laws of the United States of America, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and the laws of the State of New York, as such are in effect on the date hereof, and we have made no inquiry into, and we express no opinion as to, the statutes, regulations, treaties, common laws or other laws of any other nation, state or jurisdiction. We are not licensed to practice law in the State of Delaware and, accordingly, our opinions as to the DGCL are based solely on a review of the official statutes of the State of Delaware and the applicable provisions of the Delaware Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting such statues and provisions.
We express no opinion as to (i) the effect of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) rights to indemnification and contribution which may be limited by applicable law or equitable principles, or (iii) the effect of general principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, the effect of judicial discretion and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, and limitations on rights of acceleration, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
On the basis of the foregoing and in reliance thereon and having regard for legal considerations which we deem relevant, and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth herein, we advise you that in our opinion the Notes have been validly issued and constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, and the Notes are entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the above-referenced Registration Statement and to the use of our name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement, the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and in any amendment or supplement thereto. In giving such consent, we do not believe that we are "experts" within the meaning of such term as used in the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this opinion as an exhibit or otherwise.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 21, 2012, NetApp, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, entered into a senior unsecured credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), with the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Co-Syndication Agents, and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Arrangers. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250 million revolving unsecured credit facility. The facility provides for a sublimit for borrowing in certain foreign currencies, and a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit on the Company's or its subsidiaries' behalf. The facility provides for an expansion option that will allow the Company to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $100 million, for a potential total commitment of $350 million. The facility matures on December 21, 2017, with an option for the Company to extend the maturity date for two additional 1-year periods, subject to certain conditions. The proceeds of the loans may be used by the Company for general corporate purposes. As of December 28, 2012, no amount was outstanding under this facility.
Revolving loans accrue interest at a base rate or, at the Company's option, an adjusted LIBO rate (based on one, two, three or six-month interest periods) plus, in each case, a spread based on the ratings of the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services. The base rate means the highest of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s prime rate, the federal funds rate plus a margin equal to 0.50% and the adjusted LIBO rate for a 1-month interest period plus a margin equal to 1.00%. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to borrowings based on the base rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of borrowings based on the adjusted LIBO rate (or at each three month interval if the interest period is longer than three months). The Company may borrow, prepay without premium or penalty, and reborrow revolving loans, subject to certain conditions. The principal amount of outstanding revolving loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on the maturity date. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type.
The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement will be guaranteed by its domestic subsidiaries meeting certain materiality thresholds. As of the closing date, there were no guarantors.
The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, grant liens, sell all or substantially all of its assets, enter into certain mergers, and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type.
The events of default under the Credit Agreement include payment defaults, material misrepresentations, breaches of covenants, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, judgments, certain ERISA events and change of control defaults. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement, an increase in the rate of interest, and an obligation of any or all of the Company's subsidiary guarantors to pay the full amount of the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement.
Certain of the lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Company or the Company's affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement. If the Borrower's reimbursement of, or obligation to reimburse, any amounts in any Foreign Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Borrower shall, at its option, either (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Foreign Currency in Dollars, in an amount equal to the Equivalent Amount, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rates, on the date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.

Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.

(h) . If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans (or in the case such LC Disbursement is denominated in a Foreign Currency, at the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate for such Agreed Currency the then effective Applicable Rate with respect to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans); that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

Replacement of Issuing Bank

Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account, and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent a security interest in such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.

(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period (i) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency in respect of which the Borrower shall have failed to deliver an Interest Election Request prior to the third (3
rd
) Business Day preceding the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall automatically continue as a Eurocurrency Borrowing in the same Agreed Currency with an Interest Period of one month unless such Eurocurrency Borrowing is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.11. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall automatically be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month.

Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other transactions, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

(g) . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (g) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

Defined Terms
SECTION 2.18. .
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to (i) in the case of payments denominated in Dollars, 12:00 noon, New York City time and (ii) in the case of payments denominated in a Foreign Currency, 12:00 noon, Local Time, in the city of the Administrative Agent's Foreign Currency Payment Office for such currency, in each case on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made (i) in the same currency in which the applicable Credit Event was made (or where such currency has been converted to euro, in euro) and (ii) to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, Chicago, Illinois 60603 or, in the case of a Credit Event denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent's Foreign Currency Payment Office for such currency, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments denominated in the same currency received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if, after the making of any Credit Event in any Foreign Currency, currency control or exchange regulations are imposed in the country which issues such currency with the result that the type of currency in which the Credit Event was made (the "") no longer exists or the Borrower is not able to make payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in such Original Currency, then all payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder in such currency shall instead be made when due in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Amount (as of the date of repayment) of such payment due, it being the intention of the parties hereto that the Borrower takes all risks of the imposition of any such currency control or exchange regulations.
Original Currency
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
 
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (including without limitation the Overnight Foreign Currency Rate in the case of Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency).
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations to it under such Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive control as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section; in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
SECTION 2.19. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

SECTION 2.20. . The Borrower may from time to time elect to increase the Commitments or enter into one or more tranches of term loans (each an ""), in each case in minimum increments of $20,000,000 so long as, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such increases and all such Incremental Term Loans does not exceed $100,000,000. The Borrower may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an ""), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an ""), which agree to increase their existing Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or provide new Commitments, as the case may be; that (i) each Augmenting Lender, shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Borrower and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrower and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of hereto. No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Commitments or Incremental Term Loan pursuant to this Section 2.20. Increases and new Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall become effective on the date agreed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the relevant Increasing Lenders or Augmenting Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall become effective under this paragraph unless, (i) on the proposed date of the effectiveness of such increase or Incremental Term Loans, (A) the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower and (B) the Borrower shall be in compliance (on a pro forma basis assuming the increased Commitments have been fully drawn as Revolving Loans) with the covenants contained in Section 6.05 and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase. On the effective date of any increase in the Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.03). The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurocurrency Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.16 if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods. The Incremental Term Loans (a) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans, (b) shall not mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have amortization prior to such date) and (c) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans; that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the Maturity Date and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Revolving Loans. Incremental Term Loans may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an "") of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Increasing Lender participating in such tranche, each Augmenting Lender participating in such tranche, if any, and the Administrative Agent. The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20; provided that any such Incremental Term Loan Amendment shall require that any waivers or amendments of Section 4.02 shall also require the written consent or approval of Lenders having Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments in respect of Revolving Loans representing more than 50% of the sum of the total Revolving Credit Exposures and unused Commitments in respect of Revolving Loans. Nothing contained in this Section 2.20 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time.

SECTION 2.22. . If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from the Borrower hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency, the Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under Section 2.18, such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrower.

(b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to Section 9.02); , that, except as otherwise provided in Section 9.02, this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby;
provided
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments and (y) no Default has occurred and is continuing at such time;
(ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) , prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) , cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower's obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
(iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; and
 
(v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all facility fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender's Commitment that was utilized by such LC Exposure) and letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such LC Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized; and
(d) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.23(c), and participating interests in any such newly made Swingline Loan or any newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.23(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).

In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf, including execution of the other Loan Documents, and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
 
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for one or more of the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are commercial loans and letters of credit and not investments in a business enterprise or securities. Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material, non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to which it will continue as a lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder.
 
None of the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a Co-Syndication Agent shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to the relevant Lenders in their respective capacities as Co-Syndication Agents as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent in the preceding paragraph.
The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Administrative Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. The Administrative Agent shall have the exclusive right on behalf of the Lenders to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Loan after the date such principal or interest has become due and payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.02. .

The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.

(d) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of "each Lender" or "each Lender directly affected thereby," the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a ""), then the Borrower may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non-Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of clause (b) of Section 9.04, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non-Consenting Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting Lender under Sections 2.15 and 2.17, and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 2.16 had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender.
Non-Consenting Lender

Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this subordination is intended to benefit the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforceability of this Guaranty, and that the Administrative Agent, the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this Section 7(A).
Subordination of Subrogation

Each Guarantor agrees that any and all claims of such Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Guarantor hereunder (each an "") with respect to any "Intercompany Indebtedness" (as hereinafter defined), any endorser, obligor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any of its properties shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment, in full and in cash, of all Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements); that, as long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such Guarantor may receive payments of principal and interest from any Obligor with respect to Intercompany Indebtedness. Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from any Obligor, all rights, liens and security interests of such Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of any other Obligor shall be and are subordinated to the rights of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and the Administrative Agent in those assets. No Guarantor shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements) shall have been fully paid and satisfied (in cash) and the Commitments and all Letters of Credit (other than Extended Letters of Credit) issued under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired (in each case without any pending draw), or otherwise become subject to cash collateralization or other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed.

Should any payment, distribution, security or instrument or proceeds thereof be received by the applicable Guarantor upon or with respect to the Intercompany Indebtedness after any Insolvency Event and prior to the satisfaction of all of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements) and the termination of all financing arrangements pursuant to any Loan Document among the Borrower and the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor shall receive and hold the same in trust, as trustee, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations and shall forthwith deliver the same to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement or assignment of the Guarantor where necessary), for application to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, due or not due, and, until so delivered, the same shall be held in trust by the Guarantor as the property of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations. If any such Guarantor fails to make any such endorsement or assignment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or any of its officers or employees is irrevocably authorized to make the same. Each Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations (other than the contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements) have been paid in full (in cash) and satisfied and the Commitments and all Letters of Credit (other than Extended Letters of Credit) issued under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired (in each case without any pending draw), or otherwise become subject to cash collateralization or other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, except as otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement, no Guarantor will assign or transfer to any Person (other than the Administrative Agent) any claim any such Guarantor has or may have against any Obligor.

SECTION 8. .
Contribution with Respect to Guaranteed Obligations
(A) To the extent that any Guarantor shall make a payment under this Guaranty (a "") which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then previously or concurrently made by any other Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise would have been paid by or attributable to such Guarantor if each Guarantor had paid the aggregate Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements) satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such Guarantor's "Allocable Amount" (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Guarantors as determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements) and the Commitments and all Letters of Credit (other than Extended Letters of Credit) issued under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired (in each case without any pending draw), or otherwise become subject to cash collateralization or other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed, such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such Guarantor Payment.
Guarantor Payment
(B) As of any date of determination, the "Allocable Amount" of any Guarantor shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Guarantor over the total liabilities of such Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Guarantor that is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments made by other Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such contributions.
(C) This Section 8 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 8 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Guaranty.
(D) The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Guarantor or Guarantors to which such contribution and indemnification is owing.
(E) The rights of the indemnifying Guarantors against other Guarantors under this Section 8 shall be exercisable upon the full payment of the Guaranteed Obligations (other than contingent indemnity obligations and Guaranteed Obligations in respect of Swap Agreements and Banking Services Agreements) in cash and the Commitments and all Letters of Credit (other than Extended Letters of Credit) issued under the Credit Agreement shall have terminated or expired (in each case without any pending draw), or otherwise become subject to cash collateralization or other arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and all LC Disbursements shall have been reimbursed.
 
SECTION 9. . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any, required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act or similar statute or common law. In determining the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Guarantor's obligations hereunder pursuant to the preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification or contribution which such Guarantor may have under this Guaranty, any other agreement or applicable law shall be taken into account.
Limitation of Guaranty
SECTION 10. . If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Swap Agreement, any Banking Services Agreement or any other Loan Document shall nonetheless be payable by each of the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.
Stay of Acceleration
SECTION 11. . All notices, requests and other communications to any party hereunder shall be given in the manner prescribed in Article IX of the Credit Agreement with respect to the Administrative Agent at its notice address therein and with respect to any Guarantor, in care of the Borrower at the address of the Borrower set forth in the Credit Agreement or such other address or telecopy number as such party may hereafter specify for such purpose by notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of such Article IX.
Notices

SECTION 18. .
Taxes, Expenses of Enforcement, etc
(A) .
Taxes
 
(i) Each payment by any Guarantor hereunder or under any promissory note or application for a Letter of Credit shall be made without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by any law. If any Guarantor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Guarantor may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by the Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.
(ii) In addition, such Guarantor making a payment hereunder or under any promissory note or application for a Letter of Credit shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(iii) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by any Guarantor to a Governmental Authority, such Guarantor shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(iv) The Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are paid or payable by such Recipient in connection with any Loan Document (including amounts payable under this Section 18(A)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 18(A) shall be paid within ten (10) days after the Recipient delivers to any Guarantor a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any Lender making a claim under this Section 18(A) on behalf of any of its beneficial owners, an indemnity payment under this Section 18(A) shall be due only to the extent that such Lender is able to establish that, with respect to the applicable Indemnified Taxes, such beneficial owners supplied to the applicable Persons such properly completed and executed documentation necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, such Indemnified Taxes.
(v) By accepting the benefits hereof, each Lender agrees that it will comply with Section 2.17(f) of the Credit Agreement.
(B) . The Guarantors agree to reimburse the Administrative Agent and the other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel for the Administrative Agent and one additional local counsel in each applicable jurisdiction for the Administrative Agent, and one counsel for all the Lenders other than the Administrative Agent in connection with the collection and enforcement of amounts due under the Loan Documents, including without limitation this Guaranty.
Expenses of Enforcement, Etc
SECTION 19. . At any time after all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations have become due and payable (by acceleration or otherwise), each Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent) may, without notice to any Guarantor and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement toward the payment of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations or the Administrative Agent to any Guarantor, and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to any Guarantor, at any time held by or coming into the possession of such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent) or any of their respective affiliates.
Setoff
 
SECTION 20. . Each Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrower and any and all endorsers and/or other Guarantors of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, that diligent inquiry would reveal, and each Guarantor hereby agrees that none of the Holders of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent) shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to any of them regarding such condition or any such circumstances. In the event any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), in its sole discretion, undertakes at any time or from time to time to provide any such information to a Guarantor, such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent) shall be under no obligation (i) to undertake any investigation not a part of its regular business routine, (ii) to disclose any information which such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), pursuant to accepted or reasonable commercial finance or banking practices, wishes to maintain confidential or (iii) to make any other or future disclosures of such information or any other information to such Guarantor.
Financial Information
SECTION 21. . Wherever possible, each provision of this Guaranty shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty.
Severability
SECTION 22. . This Guaranty represents the final agreement of each of the Guarantors with respect to the matters contained herein and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior or contemporaneous agreements, or subsequent oral agreements, between the Guarantor and any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent).

SECTION 23. . Section headings in this Guaranty are for convenience of reference only and shall not govern the interpretation of any provision of this Guaranty.
Headings
SECTION 24. . If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Guarantor hereunder in the currency expressed to be payable herein (the "") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency at the Administrative Agent's main New York City office on the Business Day preceding that on which final, non-appealable judgment is given. The obligations of each Guarantor in respect of any sum due hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, may in accordance with normal, reasonable banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency. If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, in the specified currency, each Guarantor agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally due to any Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, in the specified currency and (b) amounts shared with other Holders of Guaranteed Obligations as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such other Holder of Guaranteed Obligations under Section 2.18 of the Credit Agreement, such Holder of Guaranteed Obligations (including the Administrative Agent), as the case may be, agrees, by accepting the benefits hereof, to remit such excess to such Guarantor.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 13, 2013, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the third quarter ended January 25, 2013.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition related income and expenses.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
 
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
 
 
2
 
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
H.. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our Company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure Company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure Company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Supplemental Commentary
February 13, 2013
 
This supplemental commentary is provided concurrently with our earnings press release to allow for additional time to review and analyze supplemental data prior to the companys earnings call. This information will not be read during the live call.
 
Safe Harbor Statement
These prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections that involve risk and uncertainty, including the statements under (a) the Q4 FY13 Outlook section Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including general economic and market conditions, such as the global macroeconomic environment and the continuing deliberations regarding future tax and fiscal policy in the U.S., and matters specific to our business such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services. These and other equally important factors are described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections titled Risk Factors in our most recently submitted Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
regarding our forecasts for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, and (b) the expected dilutive effect from our outstanding convertible notes. 
 
All numbers herein are stated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) unless indicated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP financial information, refer to the tables at the end of this document, as well as in our press release and on our website.

Q3 Fiscal Year 2013
 
Revenue
Net revenue for the third quarter was $1,630 million, an increase of 6% sequentially and 4% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations were immaterial both sequentially and year over year.
2
Product revenue was $1,061 million, an increase of 7% sequentially and flat year over year. Product revenue was 65% of net revenue in Q3, about the same as the prior quarter.
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and recognized over the related contract period, was $229 million or 14% of revenue. SEM revenue increased 4% sequentially and 12% year over year.
Service revenue was $341 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and 14% year over year. Service revenue was 21% of net revenue in the third quarter, about the same as the prior quarter.
Sequential and year over year calculations are based upon prior results which can be found at investors.netapp.com

Foreign currency effects represent the changes in the average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the respective comparable period (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.

18
 
 
Branded and OEM Revenue
 
Branded revenue includes revenue from all products and services sold directly by us or our partners under the NetApp brand, including NetApp branded E-Series products and solutions. Our OEM revenue comprises revenue from the sale of our products by other companies under their brands and includes revenue from IBM, Fujitsu, and other E-Series OEM relationships.
 
Gross Margin
 
Operating Expenses
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $707 million decreased 1% sequentially and increased 5% year over year. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were 43% of net revenue, compared to 46% in Q2.
Our global headcount increased to approximately 13,020 at the end of Q3, up from approximately 12,650 at the end of Q2.
GAAP operating expenses included $61 million in stock-based compensation and $8 million in amortization of intangible assets.
 
19
 
 
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
Non-GAAP income from operations was $278 million, an increase of 25% sequentially and 8% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17.1% of Q3 net revenue.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $3 million, and reflects higher interest expense associated with the December issuance of our senior notes. GAAP other expenses, net includes non-cash interest expense of approximately $15 million associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $281 million, or 17.2% of net revenue in Q3, compared to 14.8% of net revenue in the prior quarter and 16.7% of net revenue in Q3 last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.6%, which reflects a prior year discrete item and a current year cumulative benefit related to the R&D tax credit approved by Congress in January 2013.
Net Income
Non-GAAP net income was $243 million, or $0.67 per share. GAAP net income was $158 million, or $0.43 per share. Our diluted share count was approximately 365 million shares, a decrease of approximately 3 million shares from the prior quarter.
 
20
 
 
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q3, diluted share count was approximately 365 million, in line with our guidance. With an average share price of $31.97 during our third quarter, the convertible notes had an impact of 150 thousand shares on our share count. Since the average stock price was below the $41.28 conversion price of the warrants, there was no share count impact from the warrants this quarter.
Whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will ultimately be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q3, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 100 thousand shares. Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.
Select Balance Sheet Items
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $6,724 million at the end of Q3, an increase of $1,153 million from Q2 and $1,858 million from Q3 last year. The increase reflects net proceeds of $994 million from our December 2012 issuance of senior notes. Of our cash, cash equivalents and investment balance, 50% was held in the U.S. At the end of Q3, total deferred revenue balance was $2,876 million, up $106 million from Q2 and up $330 million from Q3 last year.
3
 
80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventories.
5
 
21
 
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $365 million, an increase of 9% sequentially and 36% year over year. Capital expenditures were $111 million, including $70 million related to the buy-out of our remaining synthetic leases. Free cash flow totaled $254 million or 16% of revenue.
Q4 FY13 Outlook
This outlook is based on current business expectations and market conditions and continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Dilutive share count includes the estimated impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $36.02 for the first 10 trading days of our fourth quarter. We estimate share count for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 will increase to approximately 372 million shares, including an estimated 5 million shares from our outstanding convertible notes. Share count does not include our outstanding note hedge conversion, which would offset approximately 4 million shares if the conversion or maturity were to occur in the fourth quarter.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On May 21, 2013, NetApp, Inc. (NetApp or the Company) issued a press release and supplemental commentary reporting financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended April 26, 2013.  The press release and supplemental commentary are furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
These exhibits shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement NetApps condensed consolidated  financial statement information presented on a GAAP basis, the press release and supplemental commentary furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, provide investors with certain non-GAAP measures, including, but not limited to, historical non-GAAP operating results and net income and historical and future non-GAAP net income per diluted share. For purposes of internal planning, performance measurement and resource allocation, NetApps management uses non-GAAP measures of net income that exclude: (a) amortization of intangible assets, (b) stock-based compensation expenses, (c) acquisition-related income and expenses, (d) restructuring and other charges, (e) asset impairments, (f) non-cash interest expense associated with our debt, (g) net losses or gains on investments, and (h) our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. NetApps management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions because it believes the measurements provide meaningful supplemental information regarding NetApps ongoing operational performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation.
 
As described above, NetApp excludes the following items from its non-GAAP measures:
A. NetApp records amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations. The amortization of intangible assets varies depending on the level of acquisition activity. Management finds it useful to exclude these charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods and in measuring operational performance.
Amortization of intangible assets.
 
B.  NetApp excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. While management views stock-based compensation as a key element of our employee retention and long-term incentives, we do not view it as an expense to be used in evaluating operational performance in any given period. In addition, the valuation of stock-based awards and associated expense are based on factors and assumptions that management believes are, in large part, outside of managements control.
Stock-based compensation expenses.
C.  NetApp excludes acquisition-related income and expenses, including (a) merger termination proceeds, (b) due diligence, legal and other one-time integration charges, (c) the impact of inventory step-ups, and (d) write down of assets acquired that NetApp does not intend to use in its ongoing business, from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are not related to our on-going business or cost base and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for future planning and forecasting.
Acquisition-related income and expenses.
  
D. These charges include restructuring charges that are incurred based on the particular facts and circumstances of restructuring decisions, including employment and contractual settlement terms, and other related charges, and can vary in size and frequency. These items are not ordinarily included in our annual operating plan and related budget due to the unpredictability of the timing and size of these events. We therefore exclude them in our assessment of operational performance.
Restructuring and other charges.
 
E. These are non-cash charges to write down assets when there is an indication that the asset has become impaired. Management finds it useful to exclude these non-cash charges due to the unpredictability of these events in its assessment of operational performance.
Asset impairments.
 
 
2
 
F..  These are non-cash charges from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.  Management does not believe that these charges reflect the underlying performance of our business.
Non-cash interest expense
G. These include realized gains and losses on and other-than-temporary impairments of our investments related to significant investment impairments or liquidation events.  Management believes that these gains and losses do not reflect the results of our underlying, on-going businesses and, therefore, finds it useful to exclude them in assessing our performance.
Net losses or gains.
 
H.. NetApp excludes its GAAP tax provision, including discrete items, from its non-GAAP measure of net income, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon its projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. Management believes the use of a non-GAAP tax provision provides a more meaningful measure of the companys operational performance in any given period.
Income tax effects
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our earnings release and prepared remarks. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures provided in our press release and prepared remarks.

Safe Harbor Statement Under U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include all of the statements under the Outlook section relating to our forecasts for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, the benefits to us and our customers of our products and services, the expected benefits of partnerships, alliances and acquisitions, our statements regarding future , and the amount and timing of the expected charge relating to our realignment and restructuring program.  All of these forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from these statements for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, general economic and market conditions, our stock price  and matters specific to our business, such as customer demand for and acceptance of our products and services.  These and other equally important factors are described in reports and documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including the factors described under the sections titled Risk Factors in our most recently submitted Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, respectively. We disclaim any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

NetApp Usage of Non-GAAP Financials
The Company refers to the non-GAAP financial measures cited above in making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operational performance. Non-GAAP net income excludes the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related income and expenses, restructuring and other charges, asset impairments, non-cash interest expense associated with our debt, net losses or gains on investments, and our GAAP tax provision, but includes a non-GAAP tax provision based upon our projected annual non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first three quarters of the fiscal year and an actual non-GAAP tax provision for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We have excluded these items in order to enhance investors understanding of our ongoing operations. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations because they should not be used to evaluate our Company without reference to their corresponding GAAP financial measures. As such, we compensate for these material limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures.
These non-GAAP financial measures are used to: (1) measure Company performance against historical results, (2) facilitate comparisons to our competitors operating results, and (3) allow greater transparency with respect to information used by management in financial and operational decision making. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are used to measure Company performance for the purposes of determining employee incentive plan compensation. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting at this time.

Year over Year Overview

Q4 Fiscal Year 2013
 
Revenue
Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $1,717 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and 1% year over year. Foreign currency fluctuations were immaterial on a sequential and year over year basis.
2
Product revenue of $1,138 million increased 7% sequentially and declined 2% year over year. Product revenue was 66% of net revenue in Q4, compared to 65% in the prior quarter.
Revenue from software entitlements and maintenance (SEM), which is a deferred revenue element and recognized over the related contract period, was $227 million or 13% of revenue. SEM revenue declined 1% sequentially and grew 7% year over year.
Service revenue was $352 million, an increase of 3% sequentially and 8% year over year. Service revenue was 21% of net revenue in the fourth quarter, about the same as the prior quarter.
 
 
Sequential and year over year calculations are based upon prior results which can be found at investors.netapp.com

Foreign currency effects represent the changes in the average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the respective comparable period (or, in the case of deferred revenue, the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was invoiced), less current period net gains or losses on revenue hedging activities.

20
 
 
Branded and OEM Revenue
 
Branded revenue includes revenue from all products and services sold directly by us or our partners under the NetApp brand, including NetApp branded E-Series products and solutions. Our OEM revenue comprises revenue from the sale of our products by other companies under their brands and includes revenue from IBM, Fujitsu, and other E-Series OEM relationships.
 
Gross Margin
 
Operating Expenses
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $761 million increased 8% sequentially and 7% year over year. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses were 44% of net revenue, compared to 43% in Q3.
Our global headcount increased to approximately 13,060 at the end of Q4, up from approximately 13,020 at the end of Q3.
GAAP operating expenses included approximately $59 million in stock-based compensation and approximately $7 million in amortization of intangible assets.
Income from Operations, Other Income & Effective Tax Rate
 
 
21
 
 
Non-GAAP income from operations was $291 million, an increase of 5% sequentially and a decrease of 5% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 17% of Q4 net revenue.
Non-GAAP other income, net was $1 million. GAAP other expenses, net includes non-cash interest expense of approximately $16 million associated with our convertible notes.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes was $292 million, or 17.0% of net revenue in Q4, compared to 17.2% of net revenue in the prior quarter and 18.3% of net revenue in Q4 last year. Our Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.4%.
Net Income
Non-GAAP net income was $253 million, or $0.69 per share. GAAP net income was $174 million, or $0.47 per share. Our diluted share count was approximately 368 million shares, an increase of approximately 3 million shares from the prior quarter.
Impact of Convertible Note Transaction on Share Count
For Q4, diluted share count was approximately 368 million. With an average share price of $34.67 during our fourth quarter, the convertible notes had an impact of 3 million shares on our share count, assuming full conversion of all the notes at that per share price. Since the average stock price was below the $41.28 conversion price of the warrants, there was no share count impact from the warrants this quarter.
 
3
 
80% hedged on maturity or conversion of the convertible notes.
 
22
 
Prior to the maturity and conversion of our convertible debt on June 1, 2013, whenever the average quarterly share price is above the notes $31.85 conversion price, our convertible notes will have a dilutive impact on our net income per share. We expect the dilutive effect from the notes will be 80% hedged, although the hedge will not be reflected in our share count until the notes are converted or mature in June 2013, as the hedge is considered anti-dilutive under GAAP. If the notes had been converted in Q4, the hedge would have reduced our share count by approximately 2 million shares. Unlike the notes, the warrants are not hedged and are dilutive whenever the average quarterly stock price is above $41.28.
Select Balance Sheet Items
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $6.95 billion at the end of Q4, an increase of $229 million from Q3 and $1.6 billion from Q4 last year. The increase from Q4 last year reflects net proceeds of $994 million from our December 2012 issuance of senior notes. Of our cash, cash equivalents and investment balance, 49% was held in the U.S. At the end of Q4, total deferred revenue balance was $3.01 billion, up $134 million from Q3 and up $194 million from Q4 last year.
 
Select Cash Flow Statement Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $456 million, an increase of 25% sequentially and a decrease of 22% year over year. Capital expenditures were $64 million. Free cash flow totaled $392 million or 23% of revenue.
 
 
Days sales outstanding are defined as accounts receivable net divided by net revenue, multiplied by the number of days in the quarter.
4
 
Inventory turns are defined as annualized non-GAAP cost of revenues divided by net inventories.
5
 
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.
6
 
 
23
 
Q1 FY14 Outlook
This outlook is based on current business expectations, market conditions, normal slower seasonality of the first quarter and continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. Dilutive share count includes the estimated impact of our convertible notes and warrants, calculated based upon our average stock price of $35.11 for the first 10 trading days of our first quarter of fiscal 2014. We estimate share count for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 will decrease slightly to approximately 367 million shares, including an estimated 2 million shares from our outstanding convertible notes. Diluted share count does not include our outstanding note hedge conversion for the period prior to the conversion, which is expected to offset approximately 2 million shares when the conversion or maturity occurs on June 1, 2013.
 
Other Business Metrics
 
Geographic Mix
 
Americas contributed $971 million or 57% of revenue, an increase of 10% sequentially and 1% year over year. The Americas includes U.S. commercial sector and U.S. public sector. The U.S. commercial sector contributed $744 million or 43% of revenue, an increase of 9% sequentially and 4% year over year. The U.S. public sector generated $227 million or 13% of revenue, an increase of 13% from the prior quarter and a decrease of 10% year over year.

Before the market opened on June 5, 2013, NetApp, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Contract") with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman"), under which the Company will repurchase approximately $750 million of its shares of common stock, the final number of shares subject to adjustment described below. The Company will acquire these common shares under the existing share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors.
Pursuant to the ASR Contract, the Company will pay $750 million to Goldman on June 5, 2013. Shares will be delivered to the Company over the term of the ASR Contract, which is expected to end no later than August 29, 2013, although the completion date may be accelerated at Goldman's option. The exact number of shares to be repurchased generally will be determined by the average of the daily volume weighted average prices of shares traded during the term of the agreement, subject to collar provisions that will establish a minimum and maximum number of shares to be repurchased. The actual number of shares repurchased will be determined at the completion of the ASR Contract.
The ASR Contract contains the principal terms and provisions governing the accelerated share repurchase, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the number of shares that will be delivered, the required timing of delivery of the shares, the circumstances under which Goldman is permitted to make adjustments to valuation and calculation periods and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Company and Goldman to one another.
The foregoing description of the ASR Contract is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the ASR Contract, a copy of which will be filed with the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 26, 2013.
 
The disclosure provided under Item 1.01 above is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
