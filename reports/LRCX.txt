Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended March 30, 2003
FREMONT, Calif., April 16, 2003Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 30, 2003. Revenue was $187.1 million, and net income was $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share compared to revenue of $184.6 million and net income of $1.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share for the December 2002 quarter:
Ongoing net income in the March 2003 quarter, excluding certain charges, was $3.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, versus net income of $2.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the December 2002 quarter. The company believes this presentation of net income, which excludes net restructuring charges, is useful for analyzing the business because it removes the effects of accelerated expense recognition connected with our outsourcing strategy and consolidation. A table that provides a reconciliation of net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to ongoing net income is included.
New orders of $192 million increased 18 percent sequentially, and production output for the period was approximately $174 million.
The geographic distribution of new orders and revenue is shown in the following table:
Gross margin for the March 2003 quarter was $75.2 million or 40.2 percent of revenue, a sequential improvement from 39.3 percent of revenue, primarily due to higher utilization levels and proactive cost management. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring items, were $72.2 million compared to $71.5 million in the December 2002 quarter, reflecting anticipated seasonal cost increases.
Operating cash generation in the period slightly exceeded $20 million and was offset by a Yen-denominated loan repayment of approximately $51 million resulting in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and restricted cash balances of $585.3 million at the end of the quarter.
"The results for the March quarter demonstrate our solid market share gains and continued focus on reducing operating expenses. This is a winning combination for Lam. Over the course of this downturn, Lam employees have driven important new customer gains, while transforming the business by implementing an aggressive outsourcing strategy. Although the industry environment is uncertain, we are confident that we will continue to deliver better solutions to our customers, which should drive better returns to our shareholders," stated James W. Bagley, chairman and chief executive officer.

Consolidated Financial Tables to Follow
Reconciliation of US GAAP Net Income to Ongoing Net Income:
(1) For the three-month period ended March 30, 2003, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options, but excludes the assumed conversion of the outstanding warrant and convertible subordinated 4% notes because the effect would have been antidilutive. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2002, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options and warrant, but excludes the assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% and 5% notes because the effect would have been antidilutive. Outstanding options and convertible subordinated 4% notes for the nine-month period ended March 30, 2003, and outstanding options, warrants, and convertible subordinated 4% and 5% notes for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2002, were excluded from the computations of diluted net loss per common share because the effects would have been antidilutive due to the net losses for the periods.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION CONTACT: Kathleen Bela, Investor Relations, phone: 510/572-4566, e-mail: kathleen.bela@lamrc.com LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 2003 FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS FREMONT, Calif., July 23, 2003 -- Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended June 29, 2003. Revenue for the June 2003 quarter was $186.1 million, and net income was $3.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $187.1 million and net income of $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the March 2003 quarter. The company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes the effects of significant net tax benefits and net restructuring charges, is useful for analyzing the business because it better enables comparisons for ongoing operations and removes the effects of expense recognition connected with our outsourcing strategy and consolidation. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing results to results under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included. Ongoing net income in the June 2003 quarter was $2.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, versus ongoing net income of $3.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the March 2003 quarter. New orders of $192 million in the June 2003 quarter reached levels recorded in the prior quarter; the geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue is shown in the following table: ~MORE~
LAM ANNOUNCES 2003 FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS...........................PAGE 2 OF 6 Ongoing gross margin for the June 2003 quarter was $76.5 million, or 41.1 percent of revenue, a sequential improvement from 40.2 percent of revenue. The improved performance includes the contribution of our outsourcing strategy and other cost reduction initiatives. Ongoing operating expenses were $74.9 million compared to $72.2 million in the March 2003 quarter, the result of an increased number of working days and higher employee compensation costs. Production output for the period was approximately $175 million. Owing to focused asset management initiatives, operating cash generation in the period was approximately $32 million, driving total cash (cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash) up $41 million to $626 million at the end of the fiscal year. "The results for the June quarter highlighted our progress on a number of key metrics," stated James W. Bagley, Lam's chairman and chief executive officer. "Notably, our market share gains in dielectric etch and 300 mm contributed to a positive book-to-bill in a difficult business environment. In addition, our outsourcing initiatives and cost reduction efforts continue to improve our gross margin," continued Bagley. "Lam employees have made significant contributions to our success, and their efforts have resulted in a suite of compelling products and services for our customers, and increasing returns for our shareholders," Bagley concluded. Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended September 28, 2003
FREMONT, Calif., October 15, 2003Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended September 28, 2003. Revenue for the September 2003 quarter was $183.7 million, and net income was $4.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $186.1 million and net income of $3.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the June 2003 quarter.
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing the business because it enables comparisons for ongoing operations by removing the effects of expense recognition connected with our outsourcing strategy and consolidation. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing results to results under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included. Ongoing net income in the September 2003 quarter was $5.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, versus ongoing net income of $2.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the June 2003 quarter.
Gross margin and operating expenses calculated according to GAAP for the September 2003 quarter were $78.5 million and $73.6 million, respectively. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2003 quarter was $78.3 million, or 42.6 percent of revenue, which represents an improvement of 1.5 percentage points when compared to the previous quarter, while ongoing operating expenses declined to $72.5 million sequentially. Favorable utilization of factory and field infrastructure contributed to the improved performance, reflecting continued execution of our outsourcing initiatives.
 
New orders of approximately $211 million in the September 2003 quarter represent 10 percent sequential growth, continuing the positive momentum started early in the calendar year. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue is shown in the following table:
Production output for the period was approximately $158 million. As of September 28, 2003, deferred revenue and profit were $46.9 million and $28.4 million, respectively, and backlog was $291.4 million.
Total cash (cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash) increased by $17.1 million to $642.9 million at the end of the September quarter, due primarily to the exercise of employee stock options.
"There are early signs that demand for wafer processing equipment is improving," stated James W. Bagley, Lam's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our orders this quarter are indicative of an improved market environment as well as our improved market position."
"Since September 2001, we have been evolving our new business model. This new model, coupled with a competitive portfolio of products and services, should enable us to expand profitability over the course of the entire industry cycle," Bagley concluded.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the future demand for wafer processing equipment, the impact of Lam's new business model and the Company's future profitability.
 
Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2003, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations.

FREMONT, Calif., January 21, 2004Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended December 28, 2003. Revenue for the period was $191.5 million, and net income was $6.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $183.7 million and net income of $4.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the September 2003 quarter. Gross margin and operating expenses for the December 2003 quarter were $87.2 million and $79.2 million, respectively.
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing the business because it enables comparisons for ongoing operations by removing the effects of expense recognition connected with its outsourcing strategy and consolidation. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing results to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included.
Ongoing net income for the December 2003 quarter was $10.0 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, versus ongoing net income of $5.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share for the previous quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the December 2003 quarter was $86.1 million, or 45 percent of revenue, representing a sequential improvement of 2.4 percentage points. Improved utilization of factory resources and assets was the major contributor to the stronger gross margin performance.
 
New orders of approximately $271 million grew 28% over the prior quarter, accelerating the positive momentum started early in the calendar year and yielding an ending backlog of $375 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue is shown in the following table:
Total cash (cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash) increased by $61.5 million to $704.5 million at the end of the December quarter. Focus on efficient use of working capital, including accounts receivable and inventory, supplemented the $31 million received from the exercise of employee stock options. Deferred revenue and profit were $47.6 million and $29.0 million, respectively at quarter end.
"I am pleased with the results for the December quarter," stated James W. Bagley, Lam's chairman and chief executive officer. "The Company's performance during the quarter reflects the inherent benefits of our new business model, and underscores the strength in our market position. New orders were higher than previously expected, and the business environment continues to be robust for Lam. Clearly, industry fundamentals have improved, and we are pleased that our flagship product set, the 2300 Etch Series, is the first choice for many of the world's largest semiconductor makers," Bagley concluded.

Revenue for the period was $231.1 million, and net income was $19.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $191.5 million and net income of $6.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the December 2003 quarter. Gross margin and operating expenses for the March 2004 quarter were $106.1 million and $81.4 million, respectively. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing the ongoing business trends by removing the effects of expense recognition connected with its outsourcing strategy and consolidation. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing performance to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included at the end of this press release. Sequentially, revenue growth in excess of 20 percent combined with the leverage from the Company's business model almost doubled ongoing net income. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2004 quarter was 45.8 percent of revenue as expense control and improved utilization of factory and field resources more than offset the impact of planned compensation increases. Ongoing operating expenses increased in line with expectations to approximately $80 million for the period. Ongoing net income of $19.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the March 2004 quarter compares with ongoing net income of $10.0 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the previous quarter. ~MORE~
LAM ANNOUNCES EARNINGS FOR THE MARCH 2004 QUARTER...................PAGE 2 OF 6 Consistent with the recent acceleration in capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers, new orders of $350 million represent 29 percent growth over the prior period. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue is shown in the following table: Total cash (cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash) rose by $47.1 million to $751.5 million at the end of March. Continued emphasis on working capital management and increased profits were the primary sources of cash generation. Deferred revenue and profit balances were $101.4 million and $56.6 million, respectively, and backlog reached $423 million at the end of the quarter. "We are pleased with the results for the March quarter. Our continuing focus on cost management, coupled with our revenue growth, resulted in improved profitability. Our operations excellence initiative, which includes management of receivables and inventory control, is enhancing our cash generation. As a result, we will retire our 4% convertible notes early by repaying them in full during the June 2004 quarter," stated James W. Bagley, Lam's chairman and chief executive officer. "The wafer fabrication equipment industry is in the early stages of a cyclical recovery. We expect demand to be robust over the next several quarters as semiconductor customers purchase equipment to produce their newest, most complex devices. We are winning next-generation applications with our etch product portfolio and believe our market position will continue to strengthen," Bagley concluded.

Employee stock options, warrant and assumed conversion of convertible 4% notes were excluded from diluted net income per share calculations in other periods because the effect would have been antidilutive. Diluted net income per share for the three months ended March 28, 2004, includes the assumed conversion of the convertible 4% notes. Accordingly, interest expense, net of taxes, of $0.4 million must be added back to net income for computing diluted earnings per share.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended June 27, 2004
FREMONT, Calif., July 21, 2004Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended June 27, 2004. Revenue for the period was $329.6 million, and net income was $52.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $231.1 million and net income of $19.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the March 2004 quarter. Gross margin and operating expenses for the June 2004 quarter were $159.2 million and $90.7 million, respectively.
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. This presentation removes the effects of CMP impairment charges, net gains associated with the early retirement of the Company's 4% notes and the related interest rate swap, and prior period expense recognition connected with the Company's outsourcing strategy and consolidation. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing performance to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included at the end of this press release.
Ongoing net income increased by 159 percent, driven by sequential revenue growth in excess of 42 percent combined with the leverage from the Company's business model. Ongoing gross margin for the June 2004 quarter was 49 percent of revenue due to volume growth, continued expense control, and improved utilization of factory and field resources. In the period, ongoing operating expenses increased to $90.1 million, primarily due to planned increases in variable compensation and investments in information systems. Ongoing net income of $51.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the June 2004 quarter compares with ongoing net income of $19.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the previous quarter.
 
Continued growth in capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers resulted in new orders of $408 million, which represent a 17 percent increase over the prior period. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue is shown in the following table:
Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash balances totaled $541.9 million at the end of June. Earnings leverage and the Company's continuing focus on working capital management generated cash flow from operating activities of approximately $82 million during the quarter. As planned, the Company settled its interest rate swap and repaid its 4% convertible notes in June 2004, two years prior to maturity, resulting in a net cash outlay of $292.1 million. Deferred revenue and profit balances were $196.9 million and $108.4 million, respectively, and backlog was $402.9 million at the end of the quarter.
"The June quarter's financial results clearly indicate that our business model delivers the performance that we predicted, and this model will maximize our profit and cash generation over the course of an entire cycle," stated James W. Bagley, chairman and chief executive officer of Lam. "The growth in revenue and bookings substantiates the market position gains that we have described throughout the downturn. Our financial achievement and our success in the etch market are the products of outstanding performance by our employees," Bagley concluded.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the benefits of the Company's market position and business model, the Company's ability to maximize profit and cash generation going forward, and the Company's ability to remain successful in the etch market and to continue growth in revenue and bookings.
 
Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the reports on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2003, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2004, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations.

Employee stock options, warrant and assumed conversion of convertible 4% and 5% notes were excluded from diluted net income per share calculations for the twelve months ended June 29, 2003, because the effect was antidilutive due to the net loss for the period. The warrant and assumed conversion of convertible 4% notes were excluded from diluted net income per share calculations in other periods because the effect would have been antidilutive. Diluted net income per share for the three months ended March 28, 2004, and the twelve months ended June 27, 2004, includes the assumed conversion of the convertible 4% notes. Accordingly, interest expense, net of taxes, of $0.4 million for the March quarter and $3.2 million for the twelve months ended June 27, 2004, must be added back to net income for computing diluted earnings per share.

Lam Research Corporation Ceases Future Investment in CMP
FREMONT, Calif., July 21, 2004 Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced that the Company will cease investment in CMP systems development.
"Based on recent evaluations, we have concluded that this product does not demonstrate sufficient advantages to garner the market share necessary for adequate returns on further investment," said James W. Bagley, Lam's chairman and chief executive officer. "We will continue to support the Company's installed base of Teres CMP systems but will not actively market new systems. We intend to concentrate resources on market opportunities where we believe there is greater potential for market penetration and profitability and are redeploying our CMP resources to these opportunities as well as etch projects. Our progress in etch over the last several years has been outstanding, and we look forward to building on that momentum."
All of the costs associated with this decision are recorded in the June 2004 quarter, representing a total expense of approximately $3 million. Total company R&D expenditures are planned to continue at recent levels.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the Company's future support of Teres CMP installed base, marketing and sales of CMP systems, the extent or focus of the Company's redeployment of resources, and planned levels of R&D expenditures.
 
Such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the reports on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2003, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2004, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations.

Revenue for the period was $419.5 million, and net income was $89.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $329.6 million and net income of $52.7 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the June 2004 quarter. Gross margin and operating expenses for the September 2004 quarter were $214.8 million and $93.5 million, respectively. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. In the September 2004 quarter, there are no significant differences between the ongoing results and the results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The June 2004 quarter presentation removes the effects of CMP impairment charges and net gains associated with the early retirement of the Company's 4% notes and the related interest rate swap. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing performance to results under GAAP are included at the end of this press release. Ongoing net income increased by 74 percent, driven by sequential revenue growth in excess of 27 percent combined with the leverage from the Company's business model. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2004 quarter was over 51 percent of revenue primarily due to volume growth, driving improved utilization of factory and field resources. In addition, the results reflect continued expense control and efficient asset management. In the period, ongoing operating expenses increased as planned to $93.5 million, primarily due to increases in variable compensation and employee benefits expenses. Ongoing net income of $89.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the September 2004 quarter compares with ongoing net income of $51.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the previous quarter. ~MORE~

Although our customers' investment activity may slow, we believe our product portfolio is particularly well positioned, and we expect to expand our market share in next-generation applications.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION CONTACT: Kathleen Bela, Investor Relations, phone: 510/572-4566, e-mail: kathleen.bela@lamrc.com LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 26, 2004 FREMONT, Calif., January 20, 2005 -- Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended December 26, 2004. Revenue for the period was $379.8 million, and net income was $83.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $419.5 million and net income of $89.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, for the September 2004 quarter. Gross margin for the December 2004 quarter was 52.4 percent of revenue compared to 51.2 percent of revenue in the September 2004 quarter. The improvement in gross margin was primarily the result of lower material content as a percent of revenue. In the period, operating expenses decreased to $90.3 million, primarily due to continued expense control. New orders recorded in backlog decreased 10 percent from the prior period to approximately $387 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue during the December quarter is shown in the following table: Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash balances increased to $761.9 million at the end of December, and cash flows from operating activities were approximately $150 million during the quarter. Deferred revenue and profit balances were $123.0 million and $73.9 million, respectively, and unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $456 million at the end of the quarter. The value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $53 million. These shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers. ~MORE~

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the first Half of Calendar Year 2005
     On February 16, 2005, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established corporate performance goals for the first half of its calendar year 2005 incentive plan (the "Plan") for its named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer. The Plan provides for the payment of incentive bonuses upon achievement of certain corporate, organizational and individual performance objectives. The corporate performance objective is based on the Company's operating profit. Each officer was assigned a target percentage of his or her base salary for the period, and the calculated incentive amounts may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amounts based on the achievement of the specified performance objectives. The calculated bonus amounts will vary to the extent that the actual performance exceeds or falls below performance targets. The amount of the final incentive payments is subject to the discretion of the Committee and may vary from the calculated incentive amount.
Item 3.03. Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
Amendment and Termination of Stockholder Rights Plan
     On February 23, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing that the Board unanimously voted to amend the Rights Agreement by and between the Company and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. as Rights Agent dated as of January 23, 1997 to accelerate the final expiration date of the purchase rights issued thereunder. Under the terms of the amendment, the purchase rights will now expire at the close of business on February 28, 2005, rather than January 31, 2007, as initially provided under the stockholder rights plan. The stockholder rights plan will be terminated upon the expiration of the purchase rights, thereby eliminating the stockholder rights plan altogether.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended March 27, 2005
FREMONT, Calif., April 13, 2005Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 27, 2005. Revenue for the period was $349.3 million, and net income was $59.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $379.8 million and net income of $83.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the December 2004 quarter. Gross margin and operating expenses for the March 2005 quarter were $174.6 million and $95.9 million, respectively.
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. During the March 2005 quarter, the Company received a tax refund, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company also recognized additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities included in prior restructuring plans. Tables that provide reconciliations of ongoing performance to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing gross margin for the March 2005 quarter was 50.0 percent of revenue compared to 52.4 percent of revenue in the December 2004 quarter. The gross margin achieved for the March 2005 quarter was a result of lower installation and warranty expenses and improved field resource utilization. In the period, ongoing operating expenses remained essentially flat sequentially at $89.7 million. Ongoing net income of $64.1 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the March 2005 quarter compares with ongoing net income of $83.6 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the December 2004 quarter.
 
New orders recorded in backlog decreased 19% sequentially to $315 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue during the March quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash balances increased to $838.8 million at the end of March, and cash flows from operating activities were approximately $101 million during the quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances increased to $152.8 million and $86.9 million, respectively, and unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $399 million at the end of the quarter. The value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $49 million.
"The Company continues to deliver solid financial results in the current industry environment. Strong cash generation, healthy gross margins, and good expense management reflect our commitment to increasing shareholder value," stated James W. Bagley, Lam's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
"In 2004, we announced a $250 million stock buy-back program. In this quarter we purchased approximately $68 million of common stock and plan to continue to exercise the approved plan over the coming periods."
"The strength in our financial performance is driven by our continuing success in the markets we serve. For the fourth consecutive year, Lam is the number one provider of etch equipment to the semiconductor industry, as reported by a number of industry research firms. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to expand our market leadership, as well as our strong financial results," Bagley concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to our future financial performance, our ability to maintain and expand our market leadership and strong financial results, our future ability to increase gross margins, generate cash and control costs, and our plans for repurchasing our common stock. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, our competitors' development of new technologies that could affect our market share, margins and cash generation, and future changes to our cash requirements or spending opportunities that alter our perception of the best way to use the Company's cash reserves. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the reports on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2004, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2004, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Item 2.04. Triggering Events That Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement.
Payment of guaranteed residual value for vacated properties to lessor upon sale of the properties.
     On June 6, 2005, Lam Research Corporation ("Lam" or the "Company") received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase two properties at its Fremont, California campus. Lam had vacated these properties in connection with previously disclosed restructuring plans. The properties being purchased are two of four properties currently leased by Lam from SELCO Services Corporation under the Amended and Restated Master Lease and Deed of Trust, dated as of June 1, 2003, between SELCO, as lessor, and Lam, as lessee (the "") and the related Participation Agreement among Lam, SELCO, and Key Equipment Finance, Inc. (formerly known as Key Corporation Capital Inc.), as lender and administrative agent.
Master Lease
     Pursuant to the lease and participation agreements, Lam's obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer is $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, shall be applied against this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, Lam's remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4 million, will be paid by Lam. The amounts in the cash collateral account maintained by Lam relating to the two purchased properties being purchased in the amount of approximately $27.4 million will be released to Lam. Upon contacting the lessor regarding the marketing of the two properties subject to the transaction during Lam's fiscal quarter ended March 27, 2005, the Company recognized additional liabilities as reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 5, 2005. The Company does not believe there will be any material adjustments as a result of the transaction reported in this Current Report on Form 8-K.
     Following the transaction, Lam will continue to lease two properties at its Fremont, California campus that are subject to the June 2003 lease and two additional properties pursuant to a separate March 2003 lease with SELCO. The transaction does not affect these remaining properties.
     Following discharge of the Company's guaranteed residual value obligations at the closing of the property sale, the Company will continue to guarantee aggregate residual values of $75.0 million for the remaining properties subject to the March 2003 and June 2003 leases. The Company shall continue to maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million pursuant to the March 2003 and June 2003 leases in separate, specified interest-bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
Termination of Lease Supplements under Master Lease in connection with transfer of properties by lessor.
     At the closing of the sale of the two properties, which is expected to occur during Lam's current fiscal quarter ending June 26, 2005, the lessor shall deed the purchased properties to the buyer and Lam shall be released from its obligations under the June 2003 lease agreements with respect to the properties covered by Lease Supplements No. 4, No. 5, No. 6 and No. 7, each dated as of June 1, 2003, between Lam and the lessor. The remaining June 1, 2003 lease agreements shall continue in effect with respect to the two properties remaining subject to the Master Lease and the Participation Agreement.

The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the corporation.

delivered to the corporation within sixty (60) days following the record date relating thereto fixed pursuant to this Section 2.10.

(i) at any meeting held for the election of directors the stockholders are so divided that they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon qualification of their successors; or

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended June 26, 2005
FREMONT, Calif., July 20, 2005  Lam Research Corporation (Nasdaq: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended June 26, 2005. Revenue for the period was $353.8 million, and net income was $66.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $349.3 million and net income of $59.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the March 2005 quarter. Gross margin was $175.9 million and operating expenses were $93.3 million for the June 2005 quarter compared to gross margin of $174.6 million and operating expenses of $95.9 million for the March 2005 quarter.
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. In the June 2005 quarter, there were no significant differences between the ongoing results and the results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The March 2005 quarter ongoing presentation removed the effects of a tax refund, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses as well as additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities included in prior restructuring plans. Tables presenting reconciliations of ongoing performance to results under U.S. GAAP are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing gross margin for the June 2005 quarter was 49.7 percent of revenue compared to 50.0 percent of revenue in the March 2005 quarter. In the period, ongoing operating expenses increased as planned to $93.3 million from $89.7 million in March 2005, primarily due to accelerated R&D investments. Other income increased due to higher interest income and foreign currency gains. Ongoing net income increased to $66.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the June 2005 quarter compared with ongoing net income of $64.1 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the March 2005 quarter.
 
New orders recorded in backlog remained flat sequentially at $315 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue during the June quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash balances increased to $894.3 million at the end of June, and cash flows from operations were $134 million during the quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $150.5 million and $89.7 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $351 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $53 million.
"We are pleased with the results for this quarter," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer for Lam. "We continue to execute to our market share and profitability objectives, despite what has remained a challenging industry environment."
"We have made significant strides during the June quarter in advancing our position at leading-edge applications among our global customer base. Customers are selecting Lam based on our extensive production experience and our expertise with new and more challenging integration processes. Our commitment to providing superior products and services plays an important role in our customers' continuous efforts to increase productivity and yield on their leading-edge devices."
"We delivered another quarter marked by strong cash generation and market share success. I commend the entire team here at Lam for delivering value for our customers and shareholders," Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to our future financial performance, our future plans for products and services, our ability to execute to market share and profitability objectives, and our future ability to develop and produce leading-edge applications and expertise that meet our customers' productivity and yield objectives. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, our competitors' development of new technologies that could affect our market share, the success of our research and development programs, and our ability to develop and retain personnel with expertise needed for our success and valued by our customers. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the reports on Form 10-K for the year ended June 27, 2004, and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 27, 2005, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Beginning in the September 2005 quarter, the Company included equity-based compensation expense in cost of goods sold and operating expenses of $1.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively, or $0.03 per diluted share after income tax expense. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the September quarter was 48.6 percent compared to 49.7 percent in the June quarter. In the period, operating expenses, including the previously mentioned equity-based compensation expense, increased at a slower pace than originally planned.
 
New orders recorded in backlog increased 3 percent sequentially to $326 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue during the September quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash balances were $873.9 million at the end of September, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $47.4 million during the quarter. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included at the end of this press release. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $107.4 million and $63.7 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $382 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $54 million.
"We are pleased with the results for the September quarter and proud of the performance our employees consistently deliver," stated Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "Market share gains reflect the strength of our product portfolio and supported growth in new orders in the quarter. Looking forward, we are encouraged by signs that business is strengthening, driven by increased demand for production of leading-edge devices that are vital to a variety of new consumer products. We believe this will result in improved demand for our equipment and services through the balance of 2005."
"The Company continues to deliver excellent financial performance. Cash flows from operations represented the eighth consecutive quarter of positive operational cash generation. The Company was active in its commitment to its share repurchase program during the quarter, buying approximately 2.6 million shares for a total cash outlay of $78.7 million. We remain well positioned to continue delivering a level of performance that reflects our commitment to excellence in every facet of our business," Newberry concluded.

Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the outlook for our business, the levels of demand for our equipment and services, our future financial performance, the continuing strength of our product portfolio, management's plans for continuation of our share repurchase program, our ability to execute to market share and profitability objectives, and our future ability to develop and produce leading-edge applications and deliver expertise that meet our customers' requirements.

     Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the power and authority to grant to Eligible Recipients pursuant to the terms of the Plan: (a) Stock Options, (b) Restricted Stock, (c) Deferred Stock, (d) Performance Shares, (e) Restricted Stock Units, or (f) any combination of the foregoing.
     In particular, the Administrator shall have the authority:
               (a) to select those Eligible Recipients who shall be Participants;
               (b) to determine whether and to what extent Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units or a combination of the foregoing, are to be granted hereunder to Participants;
               (c) to determine the number of shares of Stock to be covered by each such award granted hereunder;
               (d) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any award granted hereunder (including, but not limited to, (x) the restrictions applicable to Restricted or Deferred Stock awards and the conditions under which restrictions applicable to such Restricted or Deferred Stock shall lapse, and (y) the performance goals and periods applicable to an award of Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units); and
               (e) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, which shall govern all written instruments evidencing the Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units or any combination of the foregoing granted hereunder to Participants.
     The Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion, to adopt, alter and repeal such administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the Plan as it shall from time to time deem advisable; to interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan and any award issued under the Plan (and any agreements relating thereto); and to otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan.
     All decisions made by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, including the Company and the Participants.
 
SECTION 3. STOCK SUBJECT TO PLAN.
     The total number of shares of Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan is nine million (as adjusted for the Company's three-for-one stock split of March 2000); provided, however, that the number of shares so reserved shall automatically be increased at the beginning of each calendar quarter if and to the extent that, as of such date, the quotient determined by dividing (x) the total number of shares of Stock reserved for issuance under all of Lam's stock-based incentive plans pursuant to outstanding and future awards by (y) the sum of (i) the total number of shares of Stock outstanding plus (ii) the number determined under clause (x), is less than 20%, such that immediately following any such increase such quotient will equal 18.5%; and provided, further, that the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall in no event exceed fifteen million shares as adjusted for the Company's three-for-one stock split of March 2000 and as shall be further adjusted to take into account additional changes in capitalization as set forth below. Such shares may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares. The aggregate number of shares of Stock as to which Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units may be granted to any individual during any calendar year may not, subject to adjustment as provided in this Section 3, exceed 20% of the shares of Stock reserved for the purposes of the Plan in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.
     Consistent with the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, as from time to time applicable, to the extent that (i) a Stock Option expires or is otherwise terminated without being exercised, (ii) any shares of Stock subject to any Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit award granted hereunder are forfeited; or (iii) any shares subject to Restricted Stock Unit awards are settled in cash rather than in Stock, such shares shall again be available for issuance in connection with future awards under the Plan. If any shares of Stock have been pledged as collateral for indebtedness incurred by a Participant in connection with the exercise of a Stock Option and such shares are returned to the Company in satisfaction of such indebtedness, such shares shall again be available for issuance in connection with future awards under the Plan.
     In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, stock dividend or other change in corporate structure affecting the Stock, a substitution or adjustment shall be made in (i) the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the kind, number and option price of shares subject to outstanding Stock Options granted under the Plan, and (iii) the kind, number and purchase price of shares issuable pursuant to awards of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units, as may be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. Such other substitutions or adjustments shall be made as may be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. In connection with any event described in this paragraph, the Administrator may provide, in its discretion, for the cancellation of any outstanding awards and payment in cash or other property therefor.
SECTION 4. ELIGIBILITY.
     Officers, directors and employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, and consultants and advisors and advisors to the Company or any Subsidiary, who are responsible for or are in a position to contribute to the management, growth and/or profitability of the business of the
 
Company shall be eligible to be granted Stock Options, Restricted Stock awards, Deferred Stock awards, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Unit awards hereunder. The Participants under the Plan shall be selected from time to time by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, from among the Eligible Recipients recommended by the senior management of the Company, and the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the number of shares of Stock covered by each award.
SECTION 5. DISCRETIONARY GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS.
     Stock Options may be granted alone or in addition to other awards granted under the Plan. Any Stock Option granted under the Plan shall be in such form as the Administrator may from time to time approve, and the provisions of Stock Option awards need not be the same with respect to each optionee. Recipients of Stock Options shall enter into an award agreement with the Company, in such form as the Administrator shall determine, which agreement shall set forth, among other things, the exercise price of the option, the term of the option and provisions regarding exercisability of the option granted thereunder.
     The Stock Options granted under the Plan may be of two types: (i) Incentive Stock Options and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options.
     The Administrator shall have the authority to grant any officer or employee of the Company (including directors who are also officers of the Company) Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of Stock Options. Directors who are not officers of the Company, consultants and advisors and advisors may only be granted Non-Qualified Stock Options. To the extent that any Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, it shall constitute a separate Non-Qualified Stock Option. More than one option may be granted to the same optionee and be outstanding concurrently hereunder.
     Stock Options granted under the Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator shall deem desirable:
     The option price per share of Stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on such date. If an employee owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules applicable under Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent Corporation and an Incentive Stock Option is granted to such employee, the option price of such Incentive Stock Option (to the extent required by the Code at the time of grant) shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date such Incentive Stock Option is granted.
(1) Option Price.
     . The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Administrator, but no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than ten years after the date such Stock Option is granted; provided, however, that if an employee owns or is deemed to own (by reason of the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code) more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent Corporation and an Incentive Stock Option is
(2) Option Term
 
granted to such employee, the term of such Incentive Stock Option (to the extent required by the Code at the time of grant) shall be no more than five years from the date of grant.
     Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Administrator at or after grant. The Administrator may provide, in its discretion, that any Stock Option shall be exercisable only in installments, and the Administrator may waive such installment exercise provisions at any time in whole or in part based on such factors as the Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, including but not limited to in connection with any "change in control" of the Company, as defined in any stock option agreement or otherwise.
(3) Exercisability.
     . Subject to Section 5(3) above, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price in cash or its equivalent as determined by the Administrator. As determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, payment in whole or in part may also be made (i) by means of any cashless exercise procedure approved by the Administrator, (ii) in the form of unrestricted Stock already owned by the optionee, or (iii) in the case of the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, in the form of Restricted Stock or Performance Shares subject to an award hereunder (based, in each case, on the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the option is exercised); provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the right to make payment in the form of already owned shares may be authorized only at the time of grant. If payment of the option exercise price of a Non-Qualified Stock Option is made in whole or in part in the form of Restricted Stock or Performance Shares, the shares received upon the exercise of such Stock Option shall be restricted in accordance with the original terms of the Restricted Stock or Performance Share award in question, except that the Administrator may direct that such restrictions shall apply only to that number of shares equal to the number of shares surrendered upon the exercise of such option. An optionee shall generally have the rights to dividends and any other rights of a stockholder with respect to the Stock subject to the option only after the optionee has given written notice of exercise, has paid in full for such shares, and, if requested, has given the representation described in paragraph (1) of Section 10.
(4) Method of Exercise
     The Administrator may require the voluntary surrender of all or a portion of any Stock Option granted under this Plan or any other equity incentive plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a condition precedent to the grant of a new Award under this Plan or under any other equity incentive plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Subject to the provisions of this Plan, such new Award shall be exercisable at the price, during such period and on such other terms and conditions as are specified by the Administrator at the time the new Award is granted. Consistent with the provisions of Section 162(m), to the extent applicable, upon their surrender, Stock Options shall be canceled and the shares previously subject to such canceled Stock Options shall again be available for grants of Stock Options and other awards hereunder.
     The Company may make loans available to Stock Option holders in connection with the exercise of outstanding options granted under the Plan, as the Administrator, in its discretion, may determine. Such loans shall (i) be evidenced by promissory notes entered into by the Stock Option holders in favor of the Company, (ii) be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 5(5) and such other terms and conditions, not inconsistent
(5) Loans.
 
with the Plan, as the Administrator shall determine, (iii) bear interest, if any, at such rate as the Administrator shall determine, and (iv) be subject to Board approval (or to approval by the Administrator to the extent the Board may delegate such authority). In no event may the principal amount of any such loan exceed the sum of (x) the exercise price less the par value (if any) of the shares of Stock covered by the option, or portion thereof, exercised by the holder, and (y) any Federal, state, and local income tax attributable to such exercise. The initial term of the loan, the schedule of payments of principal and interest under the loan, the extent to which the loan is to be with or without recourse against the holder with respect to principal or interest and the conditions upon which the loan will become payable in the event of the holder's termination of employment shall be determined by the Administrator. Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, when a loan is made, shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value at least equal to the principal amount of the loan shall be pledged by the holder to the Company as security for payment of the unpaid balance of the loan, and such pledge shall be evidenced by a pledge agreement, the terms of which shall be determined by the Administrator, in its discretion; provided, however, that each loan shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any other governmental agency having jurisdiction.
     Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in accordance with Rule 16b-3, no Stock Option shall be transferable by the optionee, and all Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the optionee's lifetime, only by the optionee.
(6) Non-Transferability of Options.
     If an optionee's employment with or service as a director, consultant or advisor to the Company terminates by reason of death, Disability or for any other reason, the Stock Option may thereafter be exercised to the extent provided in the applicable subscription or award agreement, or as otherwise determined by the Administrator.
(7) Termination of Employment or Service.
     . To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the Incentive Stock Option is granted) of shares of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options granted to an Optionee under this Plan and all other option plans of the Company or its Parent Corporation become exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, such Stock Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options.
(8) Annual Limit on Incentive Stock Options
SECTION 6. [RESERVED]
SECTION 7. RESTRICTED STOCK, DEFERRED STOCK, PERFORMANCE SHARES AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.
     (1) . Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Unit awards may be issued either alone or in addition to other awards granted under the Plan. The Administrator shall determine the Participants to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be made; the number of shares to be awarded; the price, if any, to be paid by the recipient of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit awards; the Restricted Period (as defined in paragraph (3) hereof) applicable to Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock awards; the performance objectives applicable to Restricted Stock, Deferred
General
 
Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit awards; the date or dates on which restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock or Deferred Stock awards shall lapse during such Restricted Period; the date or dates on which the Participant's rights in the Restricted Stock Units shall vest; and all other conditions of the Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share and Restricted Stock Unit awards. The Administrator may also condition the grant of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock awards, Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units upon the exercise of Stock Options, or upon such other criteria as the Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion. The provisions of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. In the discretion of the Administrator, loans may be made to Participants in connection with the purchase of Restricted Stock under substantially the same terms and conditions as provided in Section 5(5) herein with respect to the exercise of Stock Options.
     (2) The prospective recipient of a Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit award shall not have any rights with respect to such Award, unless and until such recipient has executed an agreement evidencing the Award (a "Restricted Stock Award Agreement," "Deferred Stock Award Agreement," "Performance Share Award Agreement," or Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement," as appropriate) and delivered a fully executed copy thereof to the Company, within a period of sixty days (or such other period as the Administrator may specify) after the Date of Grant. Except as otherwise provided below in this Section 7(2), (i) each Participant who is awarded Restricted Stock or Performance Shares shall be issued a stock certificate in respect of such shares of Restricted Stock or Performance Shares; and (ii) such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Participant, and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Award.
Awards and Certificates.
     The Company may require that the stock certificates evidencing Restricted Stock or Performance Share awards hereunder be held in the custody of the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock award or Performance Share award, the Participant shall have delivered a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Stock covered by such award.
     With respect to Deferred Stock and Restricted Stock Unit awards (to the extent, if any, that Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be settled in shares of Stock), at the expiration of the Restricted Period or upon the vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, stock certificates in respect of such shares of Deferred Stock or Stock issuable pursuant to the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit shall be delivered to the Participant, or his or her legal representative, or the shares of Stock issued pursuant to a Deferred Stock or Restricted Stock Unit award shall be otherwise distributed to the Participant, in a number equal to the number of shares of Stock covered by the Deferred Stock or Restricted Stock Unit award. As appropriate, applicable legends may be placed on stock certificates issued pursuant to a Deferred Stock or Restricted Stock Unit award.
     (3) . The Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share and Restricted Stock Unit awards granted pursuant to this Section 7 shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:
Restrictions and Conditions
 
     (a) Subject to the provisions of the Plan and the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, Deferred Stock Award Agreement, Performance Share Award Agreement, or Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, as appropriate, governing such Award, during such period as may be set by the Administrator commencing on the Date of Grant (the "Restricted Period"), the Participant shall not be permitted to sell, transfer, pledge or assign shares of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock or Performance Shares or shall not be vested in the rights to the Restricted Stock Units awarded under this Plan; provided that the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, provide for the lapse of such restrictions or the vesting in such rights in installments and may accelerate or waive such restrictions or vesting in whole or in part based on the attainment of certain performance related goals, the Participant's termination of employment or service, death or Disability or the occurrence of a "Change of Control" as defined in the agreement evidencing such award or otherwise.
     (b) Except as provided in paragraph (3)(a) of this Section 7 or in the Award agreement, the Participant shall generally have, with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock or Performance Shares, all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such stock during the Restricted Period. The Participant shall generally not have the rights of a stockholder with respect to stock subject to Deferred Stock awards during the Restricted Period or with respect to unissued Stock subject to Restricted Stock Unit awards; provided, however, that dividends declared during the Restricted Period with respect to the number of shares covered by a Deferred Stock award shall be paid to the Participant. With respect to Restricted Stock Unit awards, prior to settlement or forfeiture, any Restricted Stock Unit award may, at the Administrator's discretion, carry with it a right to dividend equivalents. Such right entitles the Participant to be credited with an amount equal to all cash dividends paid on one share of Stock while the Restricted Stock Unit is outstanding. Dividend equivalents may be converted into additional Restricted Stock Units. Settlement of dividend equivalents may be made in the form of cash, in the form of shares of Stock, or in a combination of both. Prior to distribution, any dividend equivalents that are not paid shall be subject to the same conditions and restrictions as the Restricted Stock Units to which they attach. Certificates for shares of unrestricted Stock shall be delivered to the Participant promptly after, and only after, the Restricted Period shall expire without forfeiture in respect of such shares of Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Deferred Stock, or upon vesting, without forfeiture, in Restricted Stock Units, except as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall otherwise determine.
     (c) The rights of holders of Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share and Restricted Stock Unit awards upon termination of employment or service for any reason during the Restricted Period or prior to completion of vesting in the Restricted Stock Units shall be set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, Deferred Stock Award Agreement, Performance Share Award Agreement or Restricted Stock Unit Award, as appropriate, governing such awards.
     (d) Settlement of vested Restricted Stock Units may be made in the form of (i) cash, (ii) shares of Stock, or (iii) any combination of both, as determined by the Administrator. The actual number of Restricted Stock Units eligible for settlement may be larger or smaller than the number included in the original Award, based on predetermined performance factors. Methods of converting Restricted Stock Units into cash may include (without limitation ) a method based on the average Fair Market Value of a share of Stock over a series of trading days.
 
     Vested Restricted Stock Units may be settled in a lump sum or in installments. The distribution may occur or commence when all vesting conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units have been satisfied or lapsed, or it may be deferred to any later date. The amount of a deferred distribution may be increased by an interest factor or by dividend equivalents. Until a Restricted Stock Unit award is settled, the number of such Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 3.
     (e) With respect to awards intended to constitute "qualified performance based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, the applicable performance goals shall be based upon earnings, earnings per share, revenue growth or return on equity.
SECTION 8. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.
     The Board may amend, alter or discontinue the Plan, but no amendment, alteration, or discontinuation shall be made that would impair the rights of a Participant under any award theretofore granted without such Participant's consent, or that without the approval of the stockholders (as described below) would:
     (1) except as provided in Section 3, increase the total number of shares of Stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan;
     (2) change the class of directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors and advisors eligible to participate in the Plan; or
     (3) extend the maximum option period under paragraph (2) of Section 5 of the Plan.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, stockholder approval under this Section 8 shall only be required at such time and under such circumstances as stockholder approval would be required under Section 162(m) of the Code or other applicable law, rule or regulation with respect to any material amendment to any employee benefit plan of the Company.
     The Administrator may amend the terms of any award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but, subject to Section 3 above, no such amendment shall impair the rights of any holder without his or her consent.
SECTION 9. UNFUNDED STATUS OF PLAN.
     The Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
SECTION 10. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
     (1) The Administrator may require each person purchasing shares pursuant to a Stock Option to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the
 
shares without a view to distribution thereof. The certificates for such shares may include any legend which the Administrator deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer.
     All certificates for shares of Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Administrator may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Stock is then listed, and any applicable Federal or state securities law, and the Administrator may cause a legend or legends to be placed on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
     (2) Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The adoption of the Plan shall not confer upon any officer, director, employee, consultant or advisor of the Company any right to continued employment or service with the Company, as the case may be, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the employment or service of any of its officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisors or advisors at any time.
     (3) Each Participant shall, no later than the date as of which the value of an award first becomes includible in the gross income of the Participant for Federal income tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator regarding payment of, any Federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the award. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on the making of such payments or arrangements, and the Company shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant.
     (4) No member of the Board or the Administrator, nor any officer or employee of the Company acting on behalf of the Board or the Administrator, shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Board or the Administrator and each and any officer or employee of the Company acting on their behalf shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company in respect of any such action, determination or interpretation.
SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE OF PLAN.
     The Plan became effective (the "Effective Date") on August 5, 1997, the date the Company's stockholders formally approved the Plan.
SECTION 12. TERM OF PLAN.
     No Stock Option, Restricted Stock, Deferred Stock, Performance Share or Restricted Stock Unit award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan on or after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, but awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended December 25, 2005
FREMONT, Calif., January 18, 2006Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended December 25, 2005. Revenue for the period was $358.2 million, and net income was $77.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $320.9 million, and net income of $49.5 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the September 2005 quarter. Gross margin was $177.5 million and operating expenses were $100.6 million for the December 2005 quarter compared to gross margin of $156.1 million and operating expenses of $96.4 million for the September 2005 quarter.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the December quarter was 49.5 percent compared to 48.6 percent in the September quarter. The increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of increases in R&D spending, including equity and incentive-based compensation expense.
The income tax expense of $8.4 million in the December 2005 quarter reflects a fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate assumption of 21.5 percent.
 
New orders recorded in backlog increased 24 percent sequentially to $403 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue during the December quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash, short-term investments and restricted cash balances were $977.3 million at the end of December, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $111.4 million during the quarter. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included at the end of this press release. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $161.4 million and $98.0 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $404 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $46 million.
"Business conditions continued to strengthen in the December quarter," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer of Lam. "Improving demand for wafer processing equipment and services coupled with recent market share gains have resulted in a significant increase in new orders. We believe the continued increase in selection of our equipment into today's most advanced wafer processing fabs as well as recent next-generation technology wins is a reflection of the Company's ongoing competitiveness."
"The rise in new orders is among several achievements during the quarter. Profitability was strong, resulting in gross margins of 49.5 percent and operating margins of 21.5 percent. In addition, for calendar year 2005, we have generated $375 million of net free cash flow, which is 27 percent of revenue. Results achieved during the December quarter, and the year, illustrate our employees' outstanding performance and the Company's commitment to setting the standard of excellence for the wafer fab equipment industry," Newberry concluded.
 
The Company believes the presentation of net free cash flows, which is derived by subtracting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities, is useful for analyzing the Company's financial performance as a reflection of the Company's ability to generate cash exclusive of capital expenditures. A table that provides a calculation of net free cash flows is included at the end of this press release.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the levels of demand for wafer processing equipment and services and our customers' continuing selection of our equipment. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, the level of demand for new consumer products, our competitors' development of new technologies that could affect our market share, and the success of our research and development programs. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 26, 2005, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 25, 2005, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Newberry was assigned a target incentive amount of 100% of his salary for the period. Actual incentive awards may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amounts based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amounts. No incentive awards are paid under the Incentive Plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin, operating profit, and cash generation targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives.

EXHIBIT 10.1
     This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement is entered into between Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Participant"). This Agreement (the "Agreement") is effective as of , 200 (the "Grant Date").
               
               
               
               
               
               
     
     Restricted Stock Units are granted to the Participant pursuant to the terms of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning specified in the Plan.
      it is hereby agreed as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE,
     1.     . The Company has granted to the Participant () Restricted Stock Units. The Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver shares of Company Stock.
Award of Restricted Stock Units
               
               
               
               
     2.      . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that the Participant continues to provide Service (as defined in Section 3 below) to the Company (or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary), 100% of the Restricted Stock Units will vest and become payable in shares of Company Stock (as set forth in Section 4) on [INSERT DATE] (the "Vesting Date").
Vesting
     3.      . If the Participant's Service (as defined below) is terminated by the Participant or by the Company or a Subsidiary for any reason, including Participant's death or Disability before all Restricted Stock Units have vested, the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited by the Participant. As of the 31st (or 91st if reemployment is guaranteed by statute or contract) day of a leave of absence, vesting of the Restricted Stock Units will be suspended and vesting credit will no longer accrue, unless otherwise determined by the Committee or required by contract or statute. If the Participant returns to Service immediately after the end of an approved leave of absence, vesting credit shall continue to accrue from that date of continued Service. For purposes of this Agreement, "Service" shall mean the performance of services for the Company (or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary) in the capacity of an employee, officer, consultant, or director (which includes non-employee and employee directors).
Effect of Termination of Service or Leave of Absence
     4.      . Subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, on the Vesting Date, the Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be converted into unrestricted shares of Company Stock. Such shares will be issued to the Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry in the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) as soon as practicable after the end of the Restricted Period, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is 2 / months from the end of (i) the Participant's tax year that includes the Vesting Date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the Vesting Date. Shares of Company Stock issued in respect of a Restricted Stock Unit shall be deemed to be issued in consideration of past services actually rendered by the Participant to the Company or a Subsidiary or for its benefit for which the Participant has not previously been compensated or for future services to be rendered, as the case may be, which the Company deems to have a value at least equal to the aggregate par value of the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Unit.
Form and Timing of Payment
1
2
     5.      . At the Company's sole discretion, the
Dividends and Dividend Equivalent Payments
 
Participant may be entitled to receive cash payments equal to any cash dividends declared by the Board on the Company's Stock and other distributions paid with respect to a number of shares of Company Stock that corresponds to the number of Restricted Stock Units each Participant holds. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in shares of Company Stock, the Fair Market Value of such shares of Company Stock on the dividend payment date shall be converted into Restricted Stock Units, and such Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions and restrictions on transferability that apply to the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which they relate.
     6.      . To meet the obligations of the Company and/or the Participant's actual employer (the "Employer") relating to the Participant with respect to any and all income tax, (including federal, state and local taxes), social insurance contributions, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items") under any applicable domestic or foreign federal, state or local statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the conversion of the Restricted Stock Units into shares or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the subsequent sale of any shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends, the Committee shall require that the Company and/or the Employer withhold a number of whole shares of Company Stock otherwise deliverable having a Fair Market Value sufficient to satisfy the statutory minimum (or such higher amount as is allowable without adverse accounting consequences) of the Participant's estimated total obligation for Tax-Related Items associated with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units. The Company and/or the Employer may also in lieu of or in addition to the foregoing, at its sole discretion, (i) require the Participant to deposit with the Company or the Employer an amount of cash sufficient to meet his or her obligation for Tax-Related Items , (ii) withhold the required amounts from the Participant's pay during the pay periods next following the date on which any such applicable tax liability otherwise arises, and/or (iii) sell or arrange for the sale of shares to be issued on the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Participant's and the Company's or the Employer's obligation for Tax-Related Items. If the Participant's and/or the Company's or the Employer's obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied as described in (iii) of this section, the Company and/or the Employer will endeavor to sell only the number of shares required to satisfy the Participant's and the Company's or the Employer's obligation for Tax-Related Items; however, the Participant agrees that the Company and/or the Employer may sell more shares than necessary to cover the Tax-Related Items. The Company shall not deliver any of the shares of Company Stock until and unless the Participant has made the deposit required herein or proper provision for required withholding has been made. The Participant hereby consents to any action reasonably taken by the Company or the Employer to meet his or her obligation for Tax-Related Items.
Tax Withholding Obligations
     7.      . During the Restricted Period, neither the Restricted Stock Units, nor the shares or any beneficial interest therein, may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated at any time. Any attempt to do so contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the above, distribution can be made pursuant to a will, the laws of descent and distribution, intra-family transfer instruments or to an inter vivos trust.
Restriction on Transferability
     8.      . The issuance of shares of Company Stock upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Participant with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on
Requirements of Law
 
which the Company Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such issuance. The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Company Stock hereby shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance of the Company Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Company, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals.
     9.      . The Participant shall not have voting or any other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units. Upon settlement of the Participant's Restricted Stock Units into shares of Company Stock, (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), the Participant will obtain full voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company.
Rights as Shareholder
     10.      .
Corporate Transactions/Changes Of Control
then immediately before the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, each award of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan shall become fully vested ("accelerate") with respect to the total number of shares of Company Stock then subject to the Award. However, an Award shall not accelerate if and to the extent: (i) the Award is, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either to be assumed by the successor corporation or parent thereof or to be replaced by an Award on equivalent terms to acquire shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof, or (ii) acceleration of the Award is subject to other limitations imposed by the Committee at the Grant Date. The determination of equivalence under clause (i) above shall be made by the Committee and shall be final, binding, and conclusive as to all parties.
              b.     Upon consummation of the Corporate Transaction, all awards of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor (or surviving) corporation or its parent company.
              c.     Each award of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan that is replaced by an equivalent award in a Corporate Transaction or that otherwise continues in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after the Corporate Transaction, to apply to the number and class of securities that would have been issued in the Corporate Transaction to an actual holder of the number of shares of Company Stock that were subject to the Award immediately before the Corporate Transaction. Appropriate adjustment shall also be made to the price payable per share, if any; provided that the aggregate price payable for such securities shall remain the same. In addition, the class and number of securities available for issuance under the Plan following the consummation of the Corporate Transaction shall be appropriately adjusted.
 
            d.     The Committee shall have full discretionary authority, exercisable either in advance of, or at the time of, a Change in Control (as defined below), to provide for the automatic acceleration of awards of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan upon the occurrence of the Change in Control. The Committee shall also have full discretionary authority to condition any such acceleration upon the subsequent termination of the Participant's Service to the Company (or a Parent Corporation or Subsidiary) within a specified period after the Change in Control. For all purposes of this Plan, a Change in Control shall mean a change in control of the Company of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), whether or not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement, other than a Corporate Transaction; provided that, without limitation, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:
            e.     The grant of an award of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan shall not affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize, or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
     11.      . Neither the Plan nor this Agreement is intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including without limitation, the Restricted Stock Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A, provided however that the Company makes no representation that this Restricted Stock Unit is not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to this Restricted Stock Unit.
No Compensation Deferrals
     12.      . The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Participant, the Company, and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
Administration
     13.      . The value of the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be included as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating the Participant's benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary, except as such
Effect on Other Employee Benefit Plans
 
plan otherwise expressly provides. The Company expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company's or any Subsidiary's employee benefit plans.
     14.      . The award of the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement shall not give the Participant any right to continue providing Service to the Company or a Subsidiary. Also, the award is completely within the discretion of the Company, is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future awards of Restricted Stock Units, or benefits in lieu of Restricted Stock Units even if Restricted Stock Units have been awarded repeatedly in the past. Restricted Stock Units are an extraordinary item that does not constitute compensation of any kind for services of any kind rendered to the Company or to a Subsidiary, and the grant of Restricted Stock Units is outside the scope of the Participant's employment contract, if any. Further, the award of the Restricted Stock Units is not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calculation of any overtime, severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits or similar payments.
No Employment Rights
     15.      . This Agreement may be amended only by a writing executed by the Company and the Participant, which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended unilaterally by the Committee by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as a copy of such amendment is delivered to the Participant, and provided that no such amendment adversely affects the rights of the Participant. Limiting the foregoing, the Committee reserves the right to change, by written notice to the Participant, the provisions of the Restricted Stock Units or this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, (including, but in no way limited to, Code Section 409A as described in Section 10 of this Agreement), provided that such amendment shall not impair the rights of the Participant with respect to outstanding Restricted Stock Units without the Participant's written consent.
Amendment of Agreement
     16.      . Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement to the Company shall be addressed to the Company in care of its Stock Administrator. Any notice to be given to the Participant shall be addressed to the Participant at the address listed in the Company's records. By a notice given pursuant to this Section, either party may designate a different address for notices. Any notice shall have been deemed given when actually delivered.

     17.      . The provisions of this Agreement are severable and if all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity shall not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid shall, if possible, be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while remaining lawful and valid.

     18.      . The Restricted Stock Units are being issued pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan and are subject to the terms of the Plan. A copy of the Plan is available upon request during normal business hours at the principal executive offices of the Company. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement violates or is inconsistent with an express provision of the Plan, the Plan provision shall govern and any inconsistent provision in this Agreement shall be of no force or effect.

The Company has established the Plan voluntarily, it is discretionary in nature and the Board may terminate, amend, or modify the Plan at any time; provided, however, that no such termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan may in any way adversely affect the Participant's rights under this Agreement, without the Participant's written approval unless such termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan is necessary in order to comply with any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision.

EXHIBIT 10.2
     This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement is entered into between Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Participant"). This Agreement (the "Agreement") is effective as of , 200 (the "Grant Date").
               
               
               
               
               
     
     Restricted Stock Units are granted to the Participant pursuant to the terms of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Plan") and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning specified in the Plan.
     NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:
     1.     . The Company has granted to the Participant () Restricted Stock Units. The Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to deliver shares of Company Stock.
Award of Restricted Stock Units
               
               
               
               
     2.     . Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that the Participant continues to provide Service (as defined in Section 3 below) to the Company (or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary), 100% of the Restricted Stock Units will vest and become payable in shares of Company Stock (as set forth in Section 4) on [INSERT DATE] (the "Vesting Date").
Vesting
     3.     . If the Participant's Service is terminated by the Participant or by the Company or a Subsidiary for any reason, including the Participant's death or Disability before all Restricted Stock Units have vested, the unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited by the Participant. As of the 31st (or 91 if reemployment is guaranteed by statute or contract) day of a leave of absence, vesting of the Restricted Stock Units will be suspended and vesting credit will no longer accrue, unless otherwise determined by the Committee or required by contract, statute or applicable local law. If the Participant returns to Service immediately after the end of an approved leave of absence, vesting credit shall continue to accrue from that date of continued Service. For purposes of this Agreement, "Service" shall mean the performance of services for the Company (or any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary) in the capacity of an employee, officer, consultant, or director (which includes non-employee and employee directors).
Effect of Termination of Service or Leave of Absence
st
     4.      . Subject to Section 6 of this Agreement, on the Vesting Date, the Restricted Stock Units shall automatically be converted into unrestricted shares of Company Stock. Such shares will be issued to the Participant (as evidenced by the appropriate entry in the books of the Company or a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company) as soon as practicable after the end of the Restricted Period, but in any event, within the period ending on the later to occur of the date that is 2 / months from the end of (i) the Participant's tax year that includes the Vesting Date, or (ii) the Company's tax year that includes the Vesting Date.
Form and Timing of Payment

     5.      . At the Company's sole discretion, the Participant may be entitled to receive cash payments equal to any cash dividends declared by the Board on the Company's Stock and other distributions paid with respect to a number of shares of Company Stock that corresponds to the number of Restricted Stock Units each Participant holds. If any such dividends or
Dividends and Dividend Equivalent Payments
 
distributions are paid in shares of Company Stock, the Fair Market Value of such shares of Company Stock on the dividend payment date shall be converted into Restricted Stock Units, and such Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the same forfeiture restrictions and restrictions on transferability that apply to the Restricted Stock Units with respect to which they relate.
     6.      . Regardless of any action the Company or the Participant's actual employer (the "Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax (including federal, state and local taxes), social insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding ("Tax-Related Items"), the Participant acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by the Participant is and remains the Participant's responsibility and that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units, the conversion of the Restricted Stock Units into shares or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the subsequent sale of any shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Participant's liability for Tax-Related Items.
Tax Withholding Obligations
     Prior to the issuance of shares upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units or the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, the Participant shall pay, or make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company or to the Employer (in their sole discretion) to satisfy all withholding and payment on account obligations of the Company and/or the Employer. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company or the Employer to withhold all applicable Tax-Related Items legally payable by the Participant from the Participant's wages or other cash compensation payable to the Participant by the Company or the Employer or to withhold in one of the following ways, as determined by the Company: (i) require the Participant to deposit with the Company an amount of cash sufficient to meet his or her obligation for Tax-Related Items, (ii) sell or arrange for the sale of shares to be issued on the vesting of Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the withholding or payment on account obligation, and/or (iii) withhold in shares, provided that the Company or the Employer shall withhold only the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the minimum withholding amount (or such higher amount as is allowable without adverse accounting consequences); such withholding will result in issuance of a lower number of shares to the Participant. If the Participant's and/or the Employer's obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied as described in (ii) of this section, the Company and the Employer will endeavor to sell only the number of shares required to satisfy the Participant's and/or the Employer's obligation for Tax-Related Items; however, the Participant agrees that the Company and/or the Employer may sell more shares than necessary to cover the Tax-Related Items and that in such event, the Company will reimburse the Participant for the excess amount withheld, in cash and without interest. The Participant shall pay to the Company or to the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Participant's receipt of Restricted Stock Units, the vesting of Restricted Stock Units, the receipt of an equivalent cash payment, or the conversion of vested Restricted Stock Units to shares that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver shares to the Participant if the Participant fails to comply with his or her obligation in connection with the Tax-Related Items as described herein. The Participant hereby consents to any action reasonably taken by the Company or the Employer to meet his or her obligation for Tax-Related Items.
     7.      . During the Restricted Period, neither the Restricted Stock Units, nor the shares or any beneficial interest therein, may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated at any time. Any attempt to do so contrary to the provisions hereof shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the above, distribution can be made pursuant to a will, the laws of descent and distribution, intra-family transfer instruments or to an inter vivos trust.
Restriction on Transferability
     8.. The issuance of shares of Company Stock upon vesting of the Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the Participant with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National Market, if applicable) on which the Company Stock may be listed for trading at the time of such issuance. The inability of the Company to
     
Requirements of Law
 
obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance of any Company Stock hereby shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance of the Company Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained. The Company, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such approvals.
     9.. The Participant shall not have voting or any other rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units. Upon settlement of the Participant's Restricted Stock Units into shares of Company Stock, (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), the Participant will obtain full voting and other rights as a shareholder of the Company.
     
Rights as Shareholder
   10..
     
Corporate Transactions/Changes Of Control
          a.     In the event of any of the following stockholder-approved transactions (a "Corporate Transaction"):
then immediately before the effective date of the Corporate Transaction, each award of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan shall become fully vested ("accelerate") with respect to the total number of shares of Company Stock then subject to the Award. However, an Award shall not accelerate if and to the extent: (i) the Award is, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, either to be assumed by the successor corporation or parent thereof or to be replaced by an Award on equivalent terms to acquire shares of the capital stock of the successor corporation or parent thereof, or (ii) acceleration of the Award is subject to other limitations imposed by the Committee at the Grant Date. The determination of equivalence under clause (i) above shall be made by the Committee and shall be final, binding, and conclusive as to all parties.
          b.     Upon consummation of the Corporate Transaction, all awards of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor (or surviving) corporation or its parent company.
          c.     Each award of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan that is replaced by an equivalent award in a Corporate Transaction or that otherwise continues in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after the Corporate Transaction, to apply to the number and class of securities that would have been issued in the Corporate Transaction to an actual holder of the number of shares of Company Stock that were subject to the Award immediately before the Corporate Transaction. Appropriate adjustment shall also be made to the price payable per share, if any; provided that the aggregate price payable for such securities shall remain the same. In addition, the class and number of securities available for issuance under the Plan following the consummation of the Corporate Transaction shall be appropriately adjusted.
          d.     The Committee shall have full discretionary authority, exercisable either in advance of, or at the time of, a Change in Control (as defined below), to provide for the automatic acceleration of awards of Restricted Stock Units granted under the Plan upon the occurrence of the Change in Control. The Committee
 
          e.     The grant of an award of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan shall not affect the right of the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize, or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate, or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
     11.      . Neither the Plan nor this Agreement is intended to provide for an elective deferral of compensation that would be subject to Section 409A ("Section 409A") of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Company reserves the right, to the extent the Company deems necessary or advisable in its sole discretion, to unilaterally amend or modify the Plan and/or this Agreement to ensure that no awards (including without limitation, the Restricted Stock Units) become subject to the requirements of Section 409A provided however that the Company makes no representation that this Restricted Stock Unit is not subject to Section 409A nor makes any undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to this Restricted Stock Unit.
No Compensation Deferrals
     12.       . The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding upon the Participant, the Company, and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination, or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
Administration
     13.      . The value of the Restricted Stock Units granted pursuant to this Agreement shall not be included as compensation, earnings, salaries, or other similar terms used when calculating the Participant's benefits under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Subsidiary, except as such
Effect on Other Employee Benefit Plans
 
plan otherwise expressly provides. The Company expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company's or any Subsidiary's employee benefit plans.
     14.      . The award of the Restricted Stock Units pursuant to this Agreement shall not give the Participant any right to continued Service with the Company or a Subsidiary and shall not interfere with the ability of the Employer to terminate the Participant's Service with the Company at any time with or without cause.
No Employment Rights
     15.      . In accepting the Restricted Stock Unit, the Participant acknowledges that:

Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the First Half of Calendar Year 2006
     On February 16, 2006, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established corporate performance goals for the first half of its calendar year 2006 incentive plan (the "Plan") for its named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman. The Plan provides for the payment of incentive bonuses upon achievement of certain corporate, organizational and individual performance objectives. The corporate performance objective is based on the Company's operating profit. Each officer was assigned a target percentage of his or her base salary for the period, and the calculated incentive amounts may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amounts based on the achievement of the specified performance objectives. The calculated bonus amounts will vary to the extent that the actual performance exceeds or falls below performance targets. The amount of the final incentive payments is subject to the discretion of the Committee and may vary from the calculated incentive amount.

Exhibit 99.1
March 9, 2006
To the Directors and Executive Officers of Lam Research Corporation:
that effective April 1, 2006, MG Trust Company, LLC will replace AST Trust Company as the trustee for the Savings Plus Plan, Lam Research 401(k). This change will require the transfer of all 401(k) Plan assets from AST to MG Trust. During the time that assets are being moved and accounts being reconciled, the participants in the 401(k) Plan will be unable to perform certain transactions in their 401(k) accounts. This is generally known as a "blackout" period for those participants. Pursuant to federal law, Be aware that this prohibition is not limited to shares that you may have in Lam's 401(k), but applies to any equity security of Lam Research that you acquired in connection with your service as a director or executive officer and that this prohibition applies to both you and your family members. Although this restriction does not apply to transactions involving equity securities that were not acquired in connection with your services as a director or executive officer, there is a presumption that any such transactions are prohibited unless you can identify the source of the shares and show that you used the same identification for all related purposes, such as tax reporting and disclosure requirements.
Please take notice
during this blackout period you will not be permitted to purchase, sell, or otherwise acquire or transfer any equity security of Lam Research Corporation if you acquired that equity security in connection with your service as a director or executive officer.
The blackout period will commence on March 25, 2006, and should conclude no later than the week of April 3, 2006. The actual end date will be determined when the 401(k) Plan participants are free to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in Lam's stock in their 401(k) Plan accounts. Lam will attempt to let you know when the blackout period has ended by email, but you should also feel free to use the contact listed below to determine if the blackout period has started or ended.
The restrictions imposed by this blackout are in addition to any other restrictions on stock trading imposed by state or federal laws and Lam's insider trading policy.
If you have any questions concerning this notice, you may contact George Schisler, Director of General Legal Services at Lam Research Corporation, 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538; telephone number (510) 572-6467.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended March 26, 2006
FREMONT, Calif., April 12, 2006Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 26, 2006. Revenue for the period was $437.4 million, and net income was $86.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $358.2 million, and net income of $77.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the December 2005 quarter. Gross margin was $219.7 million and operating expenses were $109.4 million for the March 2006 quarter compared to gross margin of $177.5 million and operating expenses of $100.6 million for the December 2005 quarter.
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing performance to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site. The March 2006 quarter ongoing presentation removes the effect of tax expense associated with the Company's decision to repatriate up to $150 million of foreign earnings in the June 2006 quarter under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act. In the December 2005 quarter, there were no significant differences between the ongoing results and the results under U.S. GAAP.
Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the March 2006 quarter was 50.2 percent compared to 49.5 percent in the December 2005 quarter. Operating expenses increased during the quarter as planned at $109 million. Equity compensation expense recorded in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $1.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, during the March 2006 quarter. Ongoing net income increased to $93.7 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the March 2006 quarter compared with ongoing net income of $77.8 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the December 2005 quarter.
 
New orders recorded in backlog increased 29 percent sequentially to $520 million. The geographic distribution of new orders as well as revenue during the March quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash balances were $1.1 billion at the end of March, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $109.6 million during the quarter. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included at the end of this press release. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $195.3 million and $119.2 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were constant at approximately $404 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $90 million.
"Market share gains and solid execution drove strong results for the March quarter," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer of Lam. "We achieved important new application wins with our diversified portfolio of etch systems and believe our innovative and production-proven technology will enable us to post gains in market share in calendar 2006. Recently, at our analyst and investors event, we announced our entrance into the clean and strip market segments and believe these areas will provide additional opportunities for growth in the future."
"Revenue grew 22 percent in the quarter and operating income grew 43 percent, when compared to the December quarter, and we generated cash from operations at 25 percent of revenue. We are committed to creating value for our customers, shareholders, and employees, and believe we are demonstrating the results of that commitment throughout our business," Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to expectations of future market share gains, additional opportunities for growth and our ability to create value for our customers, shareholders, and employees in the future. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, success of our competitors' strategies including development of new technologies by our competitors that could affect our market share, our ability to compete successfully in the clean and strip market segments, and the success of our research and development programs. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 26, 2005, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 25, 2005, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 16, 2006, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Administrative Agent, and one or more lenders party thereto. In connection with the Credit Agreement, Lam Research Corporation (LRC) entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the Credit Agreement. LRI is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of LRC.
Under the Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under the Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date. The loan under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. LRI may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders' breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. LRC's obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of the obligations of LRC under the Guarantee Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants, negative covenants, including events of default.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement and Guarantee Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation.
The information set forth above and referenced under Item 1.01 is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.
LRC has used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate the repatriation of $350 million of foreign earnings in the June 2006 quarter under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). This amount is in addition to the $150 million of foreign earnings repatriations previously announced by LRC in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 1, 2006. LRC has now completed its evaluation of current opportunities to repatriate foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA. LRC expects to record a tax expense of approximately $16 million in the June 2006 quarter for the additional amount repatriated.
Statements made in this Current Report on Form 8-K which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to expectations of the timing, accounting treatment, and recording of expenses for foreign earnings repatriations; and expectations regarding the interest rate and other adjustable terms under the credit facility. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and our plans for reacting to those changes, including how we choose to allocate our assets and resources in response to those changes. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 26, 2005, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2006, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.
Computation of Interest and Fees
          (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.10(a).
          2.11 . If prior to the first day of any Interest Period:
Inability to Determine Interest Rate
     (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period, or
     (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Majority Lenders that the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,
the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If such notice is given, then, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than three Business Days after the giving of the required notice by the Administrative Agent with respect to such circumstances, the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Lenders) shall negotiate with the Borrower in good faith in order to ascertain whether a substitute interest rate (a " ") may be agreed upon for the maintaining of Loans. If a Substitute Rate is agreed upon by the Borrowers and all the Lenders, such Substitute Rate shall apply. If a Substitute Rate is not so agreed upon by the Borrowers and all the Lenders within such time, each Lender's Loans shall thereafter bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (i) the rate certified by such Lender to be its costs of funds (from such sources as it may reasonably select out of those sources then available to it) for such Loans, (ii) the Applicable Margin.

          (c) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately available

funds. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such extension.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon, at a rate equal to the greater of such amount with interest thereon at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount, for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be the sum of (x) the cost to it of funding such amount plus (y) the Applicable Margin, on demand, from the Borrower. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the relevant Borrower with respect to such payment.
          (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at a rate per annum determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount. Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the relevant Borrower with respect to such payment.

15
     (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate; or
     (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;
and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender, by an amount that such Lender deems to be material, of making, continuing or maintaining Loans or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.
          (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after submission by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
          (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any amounts incurred more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive effect. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

If the Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, then Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.
          (d) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.
provided
          (e) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank eurodollar market.

All such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and disclosed therein). The Guarantor does not have any material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph.

Each Loan Document to which the Guarantor is a party has been duly executed and delivered by it. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which the Guarantor is a party upon execution will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).
     3.5 . The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which Guarantor is a party, the borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Security Documents).

Ownership of Property; Liens
     3.9 . The Guarantor owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its business as currently conducted. No material claim has been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of any Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property, nor does the Guarantor know of any valid basis for any such claim.

No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by a material amount. Neither the Guarantor nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability under ERISA, and neither the Guarantor nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become subject to any material liability under ERISA if the Guarantor or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.

The projections and financial information contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Guarantor to be reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended June 25, 2006
FREMONT, Calif., July 19, 2006Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2006 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended June 25, 2006. Revenue for the period was $525.6 million and net income was $122.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $437.4 million and net income of $86.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share for the March 2006 quarter. Ongoing net income increased to $139.0 million, or $0.96 per diluted share in the June 2006 quarter compared with ongoing net income of $93.7 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the March 2006 quarter.
Gross margin for the June 2006 quarter was $274.2 million compared to gross margin of $219.7 million for the March 2006 quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for the June 2006 quarter increased to 52.2 percent compared to 50.2 percent in the March 2006 quarter primarily due to product mix, revenue growth, and improved utilization of factory and field resources. Operating expenses increased during the quarter as planned to $114.7 million compared to operating expenses of $109.4 million for the March 2006 quarter. Equity compensation expense in the June 2006 quarter recorded in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $1.2 million and $4.2 million, respectively.
 
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing performance to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site. The June and March 2006 quarters' ongoing presentation removes the effect of tax expense associated with the Company's decision to repatriate foreign earnings of $350 million and $150 million, respectively, under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
New orders recorded in backlog increased 23 percent sequentially to $640 million. The geographic distribution of new orders and revenue during the June 2006 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.5 billion at the end of June, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $92.3 million during the quarter. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included at the end of this press release. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $229.7 million and $140.1 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $521 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $74 million.
"We are pleased with the results for the June quarter," stated Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "Our market share gains and the increased capital investment by our customers drove our new orders substantially above expectations. Our financial results in June demonstrate our commitment to delivering profitable market share growth, with operating margins at 30 percent for the quarter. In addition, our total net cash balance at $1.2 billion is at the highest level ever recorded by the Company."
 
"The Company hosted an Analyst and Investor Meeting during last week's SEMICON West industry trade show. During that meeting, we outlined our key areas of focus: executing to the near-term needs of our customers, extending our market leadership in etch, leveraging our global etch knowledge into adjacent markets, and delivering best-in-class financial performance. We believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in all four areas as we go forward over the next few years," Newberry concluded.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to expectations of future market share gains in etch and adjacent markets, additional opportunities for growth, the level of our financial performance in relation to comparable companies, our key areas of focus and our ability to deliver strong results in the future. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, success of our competitors' strategies including development of new technologies by our competitors that could affect our market share, our ability to compete successfully in the market segments adjacent to etch, and the success of our research and development programs. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 26, 2005, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 2006, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Lam's common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol LRCX. Lam is a NASDAQ-100 company. The Company's World Wide Web address is http://www.lamresearch.com.

Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the Second Half of Calendar Year 2006
      On August 15, 2006, based upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company established performance goals under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for the second half of calendar year 2006 for Stephen G. Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin, operating profit, and cash generation targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives. Mr. Newberry's target incentive amount is 100% of his salary. Actual incentive awards may range from zero to 2.55 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the Incentive Plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met.
      The Compensation Committee had previously established target incentive amounts and corporate performance goals for the entire calendar year 2006 for its named executive officers other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman at the Committee's meeting on February 16, 2006. Accordingly, the performance goals under the Company's calendar year 2006 incentive plan set by the Committee in February for such named executive officers continue in effect for the second half of calendar year 2006.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 5, 2006, Lam Research Corporation (Lam) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire the silicon growing and silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. Bullen Ultrasonics, based in Eaton, Ohio, is a privately-held supplier of precision machined components for semiconductor, aerospace, automotive and other applications. Lam is the largest customer of the Bullen Ultrasonics silicon business which will become a division of Lam. Bullen Ultrasonics retains assets unrelated to the silicon growing and silicon fabrication business and will continue to conduct such unrelated businesses as a separate, independently-held entity.
The acquisition includes all assets related to Bullen Ultrasonics' silicon growing and silicon fabrication business, including assets of Bullen Ultrasonics and Bullen Semiconductor (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in Suzhou, Jiangsu, PRC. The assets acquired consist of fixtures, intellectual property, equipment, inventory, material and supplies, contracts relating to the conduct of the business, certain licenses and permits issued by government authorities for use in connection with the operations of Eaton, Ohio and Suzhou manufacturing facilities, real property and leaseholds connected with such facilities, data and records related to the operation of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication business and certain proprietary rights.
Lam agreed to acquire the assets from Bullen Ultrasonics for $175 million in cash, subject to adjustment for key employee retention, specific facilities construction costs, and the valuation of certain assets at closing. Closing of the sale of the U.S.-based assets will occur upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and covenants and is expected approximately 30 to 45 days after the date of the agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated October 5, 2006, the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement agreed that the closing of the sale of the Suzhou assets would take place within 5 business days following receipt by the parties of all necessary approvals, consents and authorizations of governmental and provincial authorities in the PRC and satisfaction of other customary conditions and covenants. At the Suzhou closing, payment of $2.5 million of the purchase price will be made for the Suzhou assets.
$17.5 million of the consideration will be placed in escrow for a period of 12 months following the closing date to secure indemnification obligations of Bullen Ultrasonics and its shareholders relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties and the satisfaction of covenants.
The foregoing description of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the First Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements, which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

               (i) accept the assignment of such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract, in which case, as between Buyer and Sellers, such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract shall, to the maximum extent practicable and notwithstanding the failure to obtain the applicable Nonmaterial Consent, be transferred at the Closing pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement as elsewhere provided under this Agreement; or
               (ii) reject the assignment of such Restricted Nonmaterial Contract, in which case, notwithstanding Sections 2.1 and 2.4, (A) neither this Agreement nor the Assignment and Assumption Agreement nor any other document related to the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall constitute a sale, assignment, assumption, conveyance or delivery or an attempted sale, assignment, assumption, transfer, conveyance or delivery of such Restricted

THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS
          (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under Section 11.2 or 11.4 (an "Indemnified Person") of notice of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim against it, such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such Section (an "Indemnifying Person") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Person demonstrates that the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by the Indemnified Person's failure to give such notice.
          (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section 11.7(a) of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate or (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim and provide indemnification with respect to such Third-Party Claim), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article 11 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Person's Consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (C) the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its Consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Person's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person will be bound by any determination made in such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Person.
 
EXECUTION VERSION
          (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Related Persons other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by compromise or settlement effected without its Consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
          (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.4, each Seller Party hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding in respect of a Third-Party Claim is brought against any Buyer Indemnified Person for purposes of any claim that a Buyer Indemnified Person may have under this Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on any Seller Party with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world.
          (e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person reasonably informed of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.
          (f) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11, the parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use its Best Efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential Information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any party hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

EXECUTION VERSION
Casualty more than Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) in repairs or that would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Assets or Business; and (ii) in the case of a Condemnation, would likely result in an award to Seller in an amount in excess of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) or would otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Assets or Business.

PRORATIONS
          (a) At the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall reimburse each other, as appropriate, for the following expenses applicable to the Assets, all of which shall be prorated such that Sellers are responsible for the expenses accrued on or prior to the Closing Date and Buyer is responsible for expenses accrued after the Closing Date:
               (i) all real estate taxes and assessments applicable to the Real Property, including taxes for the calendar year of Closing that are a lien against the Real Property but not due and payable until the following calendar year, provided, that in any case and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall be responsible for all Taxes and assessments that are a lien against the Real Property but not yet due for years prior to the Closing Date, and a portion of such Taxes and assessments for the year of Closing, prorated on a daily basis through the Closing Date;
               (ii) all personal property taxes;
               (iii) utility expenses applicable to the Real Property;
               (iv) rent payments and any common area charges or other similarly pro-rated charges due under the Leases that are part of the Acquired Contracts (including percentage rent on an annualized basis, as may be adjusted for recaptured landlord allowances); and
               (v) any other items customarily prorated, as mutually agreed upon by the parties.
          (b) If there are water, gas or electric meters located at any of the Real Property, Sellers shall obtain readings thereof to a date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and the unfixed water rates and charges, sewer taxes and rents and gas and electricity charges, if any, based thereon for the intervening time shall be apportioned on the basis of such readings. If such readings are not obtainable by the Closing Date, then, at the Closing, any water rates and charges,
 
EXECUTION VERSION
sewer taxes and rents and gas and electricity charges which are based on such readings shall be prorated based upon the per diem charges obtained by using the most recent period for which such readings shall then be available. Upon the taking of subsequent actual readings, the apportionment of such charges shall be recalculated and Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, promptly shall make a payment to the other based upon such recalculations. The parties agree to make such final recalculations within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, which obligation shall survive the Closing.
          (c) If any refunds of real property taxes or assessments, water rates and charges or sewer taxes and rents shall be made after the Closing, the same shall be held in trust by Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, and shall first be applied to the unreimbursed costs incurred in obtaining the same, then the balance, if any, shall be paid to Sellers (for the period on or prior to the Closing Date) and to Buyer (for the period commencing after the Closing Date).
          (d) If, on the Closing Date, any of the Real Property shall be or shall have been affected by any special or general assessment or assessments or real property taxes payable on a lump sum or which are or may become payable in installments of which the first installment is then a charge or lien and has become payable, Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid at the Closing the unpaid installments of such assessments, including those which are to become due and payable after the Closing Date.
          (e) No insurance policies of Sellers are to be transferred to Buyer, and no apportionment of the premiums therefor shall be made.
          (f) If any of the foregoing items to be prorated under this Section 13.18 cannot be prorated at the Closing because of the unavailability of the amounts which are to be prorated, such items shall be prorated on the basis of a good faith estimate by the parties and adjusted and reconciled as soon as practicable after the Closing Date; provided, however, all such adjustments and reconciliations shall occur no later than one (1) year after the Closing Date.

Bullen, a resident of Camden, Ohio ("MB") and Vicki A. Brown, a resident of Eaton, Ohio ("VB") (Company, E122, Suzhou, MB and VB are referred to herein as "Seller Parties" collectively, and "Seller Party" individually).
     Buyer and Seller Parties are parties to that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated October 5, 2006 (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which Buyer has agreed to purchase, and Seller Parties have agreed to sell, certain assets of Company, E122 and Suzhou. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement.
     Buyer and Seller Parties mutually acknowledge that, due to certain Chinese Legal Requirements, the required Governmental Authorizations necessary for the purchase by Buyer and the sale by Suzhou of the Assets of Suzhou, as contemplated by the Agreement, cannot be obtained prior to the date Buyer and Seller Parties originally intended to close the purchase and sale transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
     Buyer and Seller Parties desire to amend the Agreement as set forth herein such that, among other things, the closing of the purchase and sale of the Assets of Company and E122 and the closing of the purchase and sale of the Assets of Suzhou, each as contemplated in the Agreement, will be bifurcated and will take place in separate closings on separate dates.
     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the promises, covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Agreement, the parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:
1. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Assets of Company and E122 (the "US Assets") (the "US Closing"), and the closing of the purchase and sale of the Assets of Suzhou (the "Suzhou Assets") (the "Suzhou Closing"), shall occur in separate closings. The term "Closing Date," when used in the Agreement, shall mean the US Closing with respect to the closing of the purchase and sale of the US Assets and shall mean the Suzhou Closing with respect to the closing of the purchase and sale of the Suzhou Assets.
2. The US Closing shall take place as provided for in and in accordance with Section 2.6 of the Agreement, , , the conditions set forth in Section 7.15 of the Agreement shall not be conditions precedent to Buyer's obligation to purchase the US Assets and the US

FREMONT, Calif., October 10, 2006Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the silicon growing and fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics for approximately $175 million in cash. Bullen Ultrasonics, headquartered in Eaton, Ohio, is a privately held supplier of precision machined components to the semiconductor, aerospace, automotive and other industries.
Under the terms of the agreement, Lam will acquire all assets related to Bullen Ultrasonics' silicon growing and fabrication business utilized in supplying chamber-critical components for Lam tools as well as for other customers in the semiconductor industry. The transaction is expected to close in 30 to 45 days. Following the closing, the silicon growing and fabrication related business will become Bullen Semiconductor, a division of Lam.
The remaining assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, independent of Lam, will operate as a supplier of machining and fabrication services for non-silicon hard, brittle materials to a variety of industries.
"This transaction will enable us to secure a consistent supply of critical silicon materials essential to the performance of our etch chambers," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer of Lam Research. "Bullen has been a key supplier to Lam since 1991, and is a recognized leader in silicon growing, ultrasonic impact grinding, and precision machining technology used in silicon material fabrication. We intend to build upon the strong track record of accomplishments established by the Bullen team and expect our shared values and business alignment to provide a solid foundation for future success."

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended September 24, 2006
FREMONT, Calif., October 11, 2006Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced earnings for the quarter ended September 24, 2006. Highlights for the September 2006 quarter were:
Revenue for the period was $604.4 million and net income was $183.5 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $525.6 million and net income of $122.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share for the June 2006 quarter. Ongoing net income was $163.9 million, or $1.13 per diluted share in the September 2006 quarter compared with ongoing net income of $139.0 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, for the June 2006 quarter.
Gross margin for the September 2006 quarter was $313.2 million, or 51.8 percent, compared to gross margin of $274.2 million, or 52.2 percent, for the June 2006 quarter. Operating expenses increased during the quarter to $118.3 million compared to operating expenses of $114.7 million for the June 2006 quarter, driven by increases in incentive-based and equity compensation, and investments supporting our etch market share growth and new product development for markets adjacent to etch. Equity compensation expense in the September 2006 quarter recorded in cost of goods sold and operating expenses was $1.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively.
 
The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results, which excludes certain special items, is useful for analyzing ongoing business trends. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing performance to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site. The September 2006 quarter ongoing presentation removes the effects of a legal judgment in favor of the Company of $15.8 million recorded in other income, net, which was previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2006, and the successful resolution of certain foreign tax matters resulting in a net tax benefit of $10.0 million. The June 2006 quarter ongoing presentation removes the effect of tax expense associated with the Company's decision to repatriate foreign earnings of $350 million under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.
New orders recorded in backlog increased 13 percent sequentially to $725 million. The geographic distribution of new orders and revenue during the September 2006 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.7 billion at the end of September, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $216.6 million during the quarter. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included at the end of this press release. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $258.2 million and $153.1 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $593 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue remained constant at approximately $74 million.
 
"September results reflect another quarter of strong revenue and earnings growth for Lam Research," stated Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer. "Operating margins and income achieved record levels, and demonstrate the leverage throughout our business model. In addition, we generated record levels of cash from operations, a consequence of our focus on a disciplined approach to asset management. Clearly, these are excellent results and provide a solid foundation for future opportunities. Our customers continue to increase their reliance on Lam to deliver next-generation capability quickly and cost-effectively. Our market share continues to grow as we effectively support our rapidly growing installed base of leading edge equipment with well characterized solutions to our customers' most critical technical challenges," Newberry concluded.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to our business model's ability to produce superior operating margins and income, our continuing ability to generate cash, through asset management or otherwise, our customers' continued reliance on us, and our ability to grow market share and effectively support our installed base. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, our ability to hire, train and retain key employees, and the success of our research and development programs. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 25, 2006, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Amended 2004 Executive Incentive Plan
     On November 2, 2006, the stockholders of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment (the "Amendment") of the Company's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan (the "Executive Incentive Plan") at the Company's annual meeting. The Amendment increases the limit on the aggregate amount of cash awards paid under the Executive Incentive Plan to any one participant in respect of specified performance goals for any twelve-month measurement period from $2,000,000 to $12,000,000 (such limit subject to proportionate adjustment in the event of a performance period that is shorter or longer than one year). The Amendment is effective for measurement periods beginning on or after November 3, 2006.
2007 Stock Incentive Plan
     On November 2, 2006, the stockholders of the Company approved the Lam Research Corporation 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2007 Stock Plan") at the Company's annual meeting. Under the 2007 Stock Plan, 15,000,000 shares of common stock will be reserved for issuance. As a result of the approval of the 2007 Stock Plan by the stockholders, the Company will cease granting awards under its 1999 Stock Option Plan and 1997 Stock Incentive Plan.
     The types of awards that may be granted under the 2007 Stock Plan are stock options (including incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options), stock appreciation rights, and stock awards, including restricted stock, deferred stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, phantom stock and similar types of awards. Employees, consultants, members of Lam's board of directors and Lam's executive officers are eligible to receive awards under the 2007 Stock Plan.
     During the pendency of the 2006 proxy solicitation, two institutional stockholders requested changes to the 2007 Stock Plan. Stockholder approval of the Plan was obtained without regard to how the votes of such stockholders were cast. Nevertheless because the Board is willing to consider stockholder inputs when they are reasonable and consistent with the Company's business objectives, following the 2006 annual meeting, on November 2, 2006, the Board amended the 2007 Stock Plan to (i) require independent director approval (by a committee of independent directors or by a majority of the independent members of the board) of all award grants made to non-employee directors under the 2007 Stock Plan, (ii) establish that such grants shall be made with the objective that non-employee director compensation taken as a whole shall not exceed the 75 percentile of comparable companies, and (iii) limit the number of shares for which vesting restrictions may be waived for reasons other than death, disability, retirement, a change of control or other exigent circumstances to 5% of the total number of shares reserved under the 2007 Stock Plan. A copy of the amended 2007 Stock Plan is attached as Exhibit 4.2.
th
Non-Employee Director Compensation
     On November 2, 2006, the independent members of the Company's board of directors changed the annual retainer amounts paid to non-employee directors. The annual retainer was set at $42,000 with an additional $2,000 annual payment to board committee chairpersons and the lead independent director.

Where this Plan specifies that an action is to be taken or a determination made by the Board, only the Board may take that action or make that determination. Where this Plan specifies that an action is to be taken or a determination made by the Committee, only the Committee may take that action or make that determination; provided that, if for some reason the Committee cannot act or make a determination, then the Board shall also be entitled to take such action or make such determination. Where this Plan references the
 
"Administrator," the action may be taken or determination made by the Board, the Committee, or other Administrator. However, only the Board or the Committee may approve grants of Awards to Executives, and an Administrator other than the Board or the Committee may grant Awards only within the guidelines established by the Board or Committee. Moreover, all actions and determinations by any Administrator are subject to the provisions of this Plan.

               (q) determine whether a transaction or event should be treated as a Change in Control, as well as the effect of a Change of Control; and

     4.3 Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.3, on all matters for which this Plan confers the authority, right or power on the Board, the Committee, or other Administrator to make decisions, that body may make those decisions in its sole and absolute discretion. Those decisions will be final, binding and conclusive. In making its decisions, the Board, Committee or other Administrator need not treat all persons eligible to receive Awards, all Awardees, all Awards or all Award Shares the same way.

If an Option or SAR is cancelled without being exercised or if the Option Price of an Option is reduced, that cancelled or repriced Option or SAR shall continue to be counted against the annual limit on Options and SARs that may be granted to any individual under this Section 5.2. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a new Employee of the Company or an Affiliate shall be eligible to be granted in the fiscal year in which he or she commences employment Options and SARs giving him or her the right to purchase or be issued up to a maximum of 2,000,000 Shares, or to receive compensation calculated with reference to that number of Shares under such Options and SARs, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10.

     6.4

               (a) The Board or Committee shall determine the acceptable form and method of payment for exercising an Option. So long as there is no material adverse accounting consequence during the term of the Award or at the time of exercise, the Board or Committee may require the delivery in Shares for the value of the net appreciation of the Shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price. The difference between full number of Shares covered by the exercised portion of the Award and the number of Shares actually delivered shall be restored to the amount of Shares reserved for issuance under Section 3.1.
               (b) Acceptable forms of payment for all Option Shares are cash, check or wire transfer, denominated in U.S. dollars except as specified by the Administrator for non-U.S. Employees or non-U.S. sub-plans.
               (c) In addition, the Administrator may permit payment to be made by any of the following methods:
                    (i) Shares, or the designation of Shares, in either case whether Shares subject to the Option or not, that have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the Option Price of the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised;
                    (ii) provided that a public market exists for the Shares, consideration received by the Company under a procedure under which a licensed broker-dealer advances funds on behalf of an Optionee or sells Option Shares on behalf of an Optionee (a ""), provided that if the Company extends or arranges for the extension of credit to an Optionee under any Cashless Exercise Procedure, no Officer or Director may participate in that Cashless Exercise Procedure;
Cashless Exercise Procedure
                    (iii) cancellation of any debt owed by the Company or any Affiliate to the Optionee by the Company including without limitation waiver of compensation due or accrued for services previously rendered to the Company; and
                    (iv) any combination of the methods of payment permitted by any paragraph of this Section 6.4.
               (d) The Administrator may also permit any other form or method of payment for Option Shares permitted by Applicable Law.
     6.5 Except as determined by the Administrator, no Option shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by the Optionee except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. However, Options may be transferred and exercised in accordance with a Domestic Relations Order, or in any manner allowed under the Form S-8 rules if so permitted by the Administrator and may be exercised by a guardian or conservator appointed to act for the Optionee. Incentive Stock Options may only be assigned in compliance with Section 7(h).
Nonassignability of Options.

Substitute Options.
 
entity (including by merger, tender offer, or other similar transaction) or of all or a portion of the assets of any entity. Any such substitution shall be effective on the effective date of the acquisition. Substitute Options may be Nonstatutory Options or Incentive Stock Options. Unless and to the extent specified otherwise by the Board, Substitute Options shall have the same terms and conditions as the options they replace, except that (subject to the provisions of Section 10) Substitute Options shall be Options to purchase Shares rather than equity securities of the granting entity and shall have an Option Price determined by the Board.
7.
Incentive Stock Options
     The following rules apply only to Incentive Stock Options and only to the extent these rules are more restrictive than the rules that would otherwise apply under this Plan. With the consent of the Optionee, or where this Plan provides that an action may be taken notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Administrator may deviate from the requirements of this Section, notwithstanding that any Incentive Stock Option modified by the Administrator will thereafter be treated as a Nonstatutory Option.
               (a) Except as provided in Section 7(e), the Expiration Date of an Incentive Stock Option shall not be later than ten years from its Grant Date, with the result that no Incentive Stock Option may be exercised after the expiration of ten years from its Grant Date.
               (b) No Incentive Stock Option may be granted more than ten years from the date this Plan was approved by the Board.
               (c) Options intended to be incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code that are granted to any single Optionee under all incentive stock option plans of the Company and its Affiliates, including incentive stock options granted under this Plan, may not vest at a rate of more than $100,000 in Fair Market Value of Shares (measured on the grant dates of the options) during any calendar year. For this purpose, an option vests with respect to a given share of stock the first time its holder may purchase that share, notwithstanding any right of the Company to repurchase that share. Unless the administrator of that option plan specifies otherwise in the related agreement governing the option, this vesting limitation shall be applied by, to the extent necessary to satisfy this $100,000 rule, treating certain stock options that were intended to be Incentive Stock Options under Section 422 of the Code as Nonstatutory Options. The stock options or portions of stock options to be reclassified as Nonstatutory Options are those with the highest option prices, whether granted under this Plan or any other equity compensation plan of the Company or any Affiliate that permits that treatment. This Section 7(c) shall not cause an Incentive Stock Option to vest before its original vesting date or cause an Incentive Stock Option that has already or would otherwise be vested to cease to vest or be vested.
               (d) In order for an Incentive Stock Option to be exercised for any form of payment other than those described in Section 6.4(b), that right must be stated at the time of grant in the Option Agreement relating to that Incentive Stock Option.
               (e) Any Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder, must have an Expiration Date that is not later than five years from its Grant Date, with the result that no
 
such Option may be exercised after the expiration of five years from the Grant Date. A "" is any person who, directly or by attribution under Section 424(d) of the Code, owns stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Affiliate on the Grant Date.
Ten Percent Stockholder
               (f) The Option Price of an Incentive Stock Option shall never be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the Grant Date. The Option Price for the Shares covered by an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder shall never be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the Grant Date.
               (g) Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees. If an Optionee changes status from an Employee to a Consultant, that Optionee's Incentive Stock Options become Nonstatutory Options if not exercised within the time period described in Section 7(i) (determined by treating that change in status as a Termination solely for purposes of this Section 7(g)).
               (h) No rights under an Incentive Stock Option may be transferred by the Optionee, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. During the life of the Optionee, an Incentive Stock Option may be exercised only by the Optionee. The Company's compliance with a Domestic Relations Order, or the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option by a guardian or conservator appointed to act for the Optionee, shall not violate this Section 7(h).
               (i) An Incentive Stock Option shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Option if it remains exercisable after, and is not exercised within, the three-month period beginning with the Optionee's Termination for any reason other than the Optionee's death or disability (as defined in Section 22(e) of the Code). In the case of Termination due to death, an Incentive Stock Option shall continue to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option if it remains exercisable after, and is not exercised within, the three month period after the Optionee's Termination provided it is exercised before the Expiration Date. In the case of Termination due to disability, an Incentive Stock Option shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Option if it remains exercisable after, and is not exercised within, one year after the Optionee's Termination.
8.
Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Awards
     8.1 The following rules apply to SARs:
Stock Appreciation Rights.
               (a) . SARs may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other Awards granted under this Plan. The Administrator may grant SARs to eligible participants subject to terms and conditions not inconsistent with this Plan and determined by the Administrator. The specific terms and conditions applicable to the Awardee shall be provided for in the Award Agreement. SARs shall be exercisable, in whole or in part, at such times as the Administrator shall specify in the Award Agreement. The grant or vesting of a SAR may be made contingent on the achievement of Objectively Determinable Performance Conditions.
General
               (b) Upon the exercise of an SAR, in whole or in part, an Awardee shall be entitled to a payment in an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a fixed number of Shares covered by the exercised portion of the SAR on the date of
Exercise of SARs.
 
exercise, over the Fair Market Value of the Shares covered by the exercised portion of the SAR on the Grant Date. The amount due to the Awardee upon the exercise of a SAR shall be paid in cash, Shares or a combination thereof, as specified in the Award Agreement, over the period or periods specified in the Award Agreement. An Award Agreement may place limits on the amount that may be paid over any specified period or periods upon the exercise of a SAR, on an aggregate basis or as to any Awardee. A SAR shall be considered exercised when the Company receives written notice of exercise in accordance with the terms of the Award Agreement from the person entitled to exercise the SAR. If a SAR has been granted in tandem with an Option, upon the exercise of the SAR, the number of shares that may be purchased pursuant to the Option shall be reduced by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
               (c) Except as determined by the Administrator, no SAR shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by the Awardee except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SARs may be transferred and exercised in accordance with a Domestic Relations Order or in any manner allowed under the Form S-8 rules if so permitted by the Administrator.
Nonassignability of SARs.
               (d) The Board may cause the Company to grant Substitute SARs in connection with the acquisition by the Company or an Affiliate of equity securities of any entity (including by merger) or all or a portion of the assets of any entity. Any such substitution shall be effective on the effective date of the acquisition. Unless and to the extent specified otherwise by the Board, Substitute SARs shall have the same terms and conditions as the awards they replace, except that (subject to the provisions of Section 9) Substitute SARs shall be exercisable with respect to the Fair Market Value of Shares rather than with regard to the value of equity securities of the granting entity and shall be on terms that, as determined by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion, properly reflects the substitution.
Substitute SARs.
     8.2 The following rules apply to all Stock Awards:
Stock Awards.
               (a) . The specific terms and conditions of a Stock Award applicable to the Awardee shall be provided for in the Award Agreement. The Award Agreement shall state the number of Shares that the Awardee shall be entitled to receive or purchase, the terms and conditions on which the Shares shall vest, the price to be paid (if any), whether Shares are to be delivered at the time of grant or at some deferred date specified in the Award Agreement, whether the Award is payable solely in Shares, cash or either and, if applicable, the time within which the Awardee must accept such offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of the Award Agreement. The Administrator may require that all Shares subject to a right of repurchase or risk of forfeiture be held in escrow until such repurchase right or risk of forfeiture lapses. The grant or vesting of a Stock Award may be made contingent on the achievement of Objectively Determinable Performance Conditions.
General
               (b) . If so provided in the Award Agreement, Award Shares acquired pursuant to a Stock Award may be subject to repurchase by the Company or an Affiliate if not vested in accordance with the Award Agreement.
Right of Repurchase
 
               (c) . If the Awardee is required to pay any amount to purchase Shares subject to the Stock Award, then the Administrator shall determine the acceptable form and method of payment for exercising a Stock Award. Acceptable forms of payment for all Award Shares are cash, check or wire transfer, denominated in U.S. dollars except as specified by the Administrator for non-U.S. sub-plans. In addition, the Administrator may permit payment to be made by any of the methods permitted with respect to the exercise of Options pursuant to Section 6.4.
Form of Payment
               (d) Except as determined by the Administrator, no Stock Award shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by the Awardee except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Stock Awards may be transferred and exercised in accordance with a Domestic Relations Order and in any manner allowed under the Form S-8 rules if so permitted by the Administrator.
Nonassignability of Stock Awards
.
               (e) The Board may cause the Company to grant Substitute Stock Awards in connection with the acquisition by the Company or an Affiliate of equity securities of any entity (including by merger) or all or a portion of the assets of any entity. Unless and to the extent specified otherwise by the Board, Substitute Stock Awards shall have the same terms and conditions as the stock awards they replace, except that (subject to the provisions of Section 10) Substitute Stock Awards shall be Stock Awards to purchase Shares rather than equity securities of the granting entity and shall have a Purchase Price that, as determined by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion, properly reflects the substitution. Any such Substituted Stock Award shall be effective on the effective date of the acquisition.
Substitute Stock Award.

Exercise of Awards
     9.1 An Award shall be exercisable in accordance with this Plan and the Award Agreement under which it is granted.
In General.
     9.2 Options and Stock Awards shall be considered exercised when the Company (or its authorized agent) receives: (a) written (including electronic) notice of exercise from the person entitled to exercise the Option or Stock Award, (b) full payment, or provision for payment, in a form and method approved by the Administrator, for the Shares for which the Option or Stock Award is being exercised, and (c) if applicable, payment, or provision for payment, in a form approved by the Administrator, of all applicable withholding taxes due upon exercise. An Award may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. SARs shall be considered exercised when the Company receives written notice of the exercise from the person entitled to exercise the SAR.
Time of Exercise.
     9.3 The Company shall issue Award Shares in the name of the person properly exercising the Award. If the Awardee is that person and so requests, the Award Shares shall be issued in the name of the Awardee and the Awardee's spouse. The Company shall endeavor to issue Award Shares promptly after an Award is exercised or after the Grant Date of a Stock Award, as applicable. Until Award Shares are actually issued, as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the stock register of the Company or its transfer agent, the
Issuance of Award Shares.
 
Awardee will not have the rights of a stockholder with respect to those Award Shares, even though the Awardee has completed all the steps necessary to exercise the Award. No adjustment shall be made for any dividend, distribution, or other right for which the record date precedes the date the Award Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 10 or with regard to Stock Awards, except as set forth in the Award Agreement.
     9.4
Termination.
               (a) . Except as provided in an Award Agreement or in writing by the Administrator, including in an Award Agreement, and as otherwise provided in Sections 9.4(b), (c), and (d) after an Awardee's Termination for other than Cause, the Awardee's Awards shall be exercisable to the extent (but only to the extent) they are vested on the date of that Termination and only during the ninety (90) days after the Termination, but in no event after the Expiration Date. Except as provided in an Award Agreement, or otherwise in writing by the Administrator (including, pursuant to Section 9.4(d)(ii)), an Award shall terminate as to all Shares that are unvested as of the Awardee's date of termination for any reason. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, in the event of termination for Cause the Award may not be exercised after the date of Termination (even as to vested Shares). To the extent the Awardee does not exercise an Award within the time specified for exercise, the Award shall automatically terminate.
In General
               (b) . Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, no Award may be exercised more than three months after the beginning of a leave of absence, other than a personal or medical leave approved by an authorized representative of the Company with employment guaranteed upon return. Awards shall not continue to vest during a leave of absence, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator with respect to an approved personal or medical leave with employment guaranteed upon return.
Leaves of Absence
               (c) . Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if an Awardee's Termination is due to death or disability (as determined by the Administrator with respect to all Awards other than Incentive Stock Options and as defined by Section 22(e) of the Code with respect to Incentive Stock Options), all Awards of that Awardee to the extent exercisable at the date of that Termination may be exercised for one year after that Termination, but in no event after the Expiration Date. In the case of Termination due to death, an Award may be exercised as provided in Section 16. In the case of Termination due to disability, if a guardian or conservator has been appointed to act for the Awardee and been granted this authority as part of that appointment, that guardian or conservator may exercise the Award on behalf of the Awardee. Death or disability occurring after an Awardee's Termination shall not cause the Termination to be treated as having occurred due to death or disability. To the extent an Award is not so exercised within the time specified for its exercise, the Award shall automatically terminate.
Death or Disability
               (d) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.4 (a)-(c), the Plan Administrator shall have complete discretion, exercisable either at the time an Award is granted or at any time while the Award remains outstanding, to:
Administrator Discretion
 
                    (i) After considering any tax and accounting consequences of such change, extend the period of time for which the Award is to remain exercisable, following the Awardee's Termination, from the limited exercise period otherwise in effect for that Award to such greater period of time as the Administrator shall deem appropriate, but in no event beyond the Expiration Date; and/or
                    (ii) Permit the Award to be exercised, during the applicable post-Termination exercise period, not only with respect to the number of vested Shares for which such Award may be exercisable at the time of the Awardee's Termination but also with respect to one or more additional installments in which the Awardee would have vested had the Awardee not been subject to Termination.
               (e) . Nothing in this Plan or in any Award Agreement, and no Award or the fact that an Award remains unvested or that Award Shares remain subject to repurchase rights or other forfeiture conditions, shall: (A) interfere with or limit the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate the employment or consultancy of any Awardee at any time, whether with or without cause or reason, and with or without the payment of severance or any other compensation or payment, or (B) interfere with the application of any provision in any of the Company's or any Affiliate's charter documents or Applicable Law relating to the election, appointment, term of office, or removal of a Director.

Certain Transactions and Events
     10.1 Except as provided in this Section 10, the existence of outstanding Awards shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its shareholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations, exchanges, or other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of the Company or any issuance of Shares or other securities or subscription rights thereto, or any issuance of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the Shares or other securities of the Company or the rights thereof, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise. Further, except as expressly provided in this Section 10 or otherwise expressly provided for in a writing approved by the Board or Committee, (i) the issuance by the Company of shares of stock or any class of securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, for cash, property, labor or services, upon direct sale, upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, (ii) the payment of a dividend in property other than Shares, or (iii) the occurrence of any similar transaction, and in any case whether or not for fair value, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to Options or other Awards theretofore granted or the purchase or repurchase price per Share.
In General.
     10.2 In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination or reclassification of stock, stock dividend, spin-off, extraordinary cash dividend or similar change to the capital structure of the Company (not including a Change of Control), the Board or Committee shall make appropriate adjustments to
Changes in Capital Structure.

The specific adjustments to be made to effectuate the intent of the preceding sentence shall be determined by the Board or the Committee, whose determination in this regard shall be final and binding on all parties. Unless the Board or Committee specifies otherwise, any securities issuable as a result of any such adjustment shall be rounded down to the next lower whole security. The Board or Committee need not adopt the same rules for each Award or each Awardee.
     10.3 In the event of (a) any merger or consolidation in which the Company shall not be the surviving entity or survives only as a subsidiary of another entity whose shareholders did not own all or substantially all of the Common Stock in substantially the same proportions as immediately prior to such transaction (which transaction shall not include a merger or consolidation with a wholly-owned subsidiary, a reincorporation of the Company in a different jurisdiction, or other transaction in which there is no substantial change in the stockholders of the Company or their relative stock holdings and the Awards granted under this Plan are assumed, converted or replaced by the successor corporation, which assumption shall be binding on all Participants), (b) the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, including a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (c) the acquisition, sale, or transfer of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Company by tender offer or similar transaction (each, a ""), any or all outstanding Awards shall be subject to the definitive agreement governing the Change of Control transaction. Such transaction agreement may provide, without limitation and in a manner that is binding on all parties, for (1) the assumption, substitution or replacement with equivalent awards of outstanding Awards (but in each case adjusted to reflect the transaction terms) by the surviving corporation or its parent, (2) continuation of outstanding Awards (but again adjusted to reflect the transaction terms) by the Company if the Company is a surviving corporation, (3) accelerated vesting, or lapse of repurchase rights or forfeiture conditions applicable to, and accelerated expiration or termination of, the outstanding Awards, or (4) settlement of outstanding Awards (including termination thereof) in cash. Except for adjustments to reflect the transaction terms as referenced above or, to the extent any Award or Award Shares are subject to accelerated vesting or lapse of restrictions approved by the Board or Committee upon specific events or conditions (and then only to the extent such acceleration benefits are reflected in the transaction agreement, the applicable Award Agreement or another written agreement between the participant and the Company), any outstanding Awards that are assumed, substituted, replaced with equivalent awards or continued shall continue following the transaction to be subject to the same vesting or other restrictions that applied to the original Award. The Administrator need not adopt the same rules or apply the same treatment for each Award or Awardee.

Award Grants to Non-Employee Directors
     11.1
General.
     Consistent with the terms of this Plan and as reflected in individual Award Agreements, the Administrator or, if required by Applicable Law, the Board, may grant Awards to Directors who are not Employees ("Non-Employee Directors") on such terms and conditions as it determines, including to provide for satisfaction of Director fee or retainer payments through issuance of Awards under the Plan. Such Awards may be done by establishing an annual or other periodic grant program, or may done through action taken to approve individual Awards from time to time. To the extent that the Administrator or the Board from time to time establish an annual or other periodic grant program for Non-Employee Directors, it may at any time amend, suspend or terminate such program with respect to Awards that have not yet been granted, without the need for approval from any Non-Employee Director who might otherwise have benefited from such Awards or from the stockholders.
     11.2
Non-Employee Director Award Guidelines
     Awards granted by the Board pursuant to Section 11.1 may be granted only with the approval of the Committee or a majority of the Company Directors then serving on the Board who meet the director independence standards of Nasdaq (or such other primary exchange or system on which Shares are traded or quoted). Such grants shall be made with the objective that Non-Employee Director compensation taken as a whole shall not exceed the 75 percentile of comparable companies.

Tax Matters
     12.1
Tax Withholding.
               (a) . Whenever Awards are granted, Award Shares vest, are issued or become free of restrictions, or Awards or Award Shares are transferred, the Company may require the Awardee to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirement, whether the related tax is imposed on the Awardee or the Company. The Company shall have no obligation to deliver Award Shares or release Award Shares from an escrow or permit a transfer of Award Shares until the Awardee has satisfied those tax withholding obligations. The Awardee accepts this requirement as a condition of her or her receipt of the Award. To the extent any payment in satisfaction of Awards is made in cash, the payment will be reduced by an amount sufficient to satisfy all tax withholding requirements.
General
               (b) . The Awardee shall pay any required withholding using the forms of consideration described in Section 6.4(b), except that, in the discretion of the Administrator, the Company may also permit the Awardee to use any of the forms of payment described in Section 6.4(c). If the Administrator permits Award Shares to be withheld from the Award to satisfy applicable withholding obligations, the Fair Market Value of the Award Shares
Method of Payment
 
withheld, as determined as of the date of withholding, shall not exceed the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates to the extent the Administrator determines such limit is necessary or advisable in light of generally accepted accounting principles.
     12.2 Any holder of Option Shares acquired under an Incentive Stock Option shall promptly notify the Administrator, following such procedures as the Administrator may require, of the sale or other disposition of any of those Option Shares if the disposition occurs during: (a) the longer of two years after the Grant Date of the Incentive Stock Option and one year after the date the Incentive Stock Option was exercised, or (b) such other period as the Administrator has established.
Reporting of Dispositions.
     12.3 Regardless of any action the Company or the Awardee's employer (the "Employer") takes with respect to any or all income tax, social security, payroll tax, payment on account, other tax-related withholding or information reporting ("Tax-Related Items"), the Awardee acknowledges and agrees that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by him is and remains the Awardee s responsibility and that the Company and or the Employer (i) make no representations nor undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of an Award; and (ii) do not commit to structure the terms or any aspect of an Award granted hereunder to reduce or eliminate the Awardee s liability for Tax-Related Items. The Awardee shall pay the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold as a result of the Awardee's participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to deliver any benefit under the Plan if the Awardee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
Liability for Applicable Taxes.
13.
Compliance with Law
     13.1 The grant of Awards and the issuance and subsequent transfer of Award Shares shall be subject to compliance with all Applicable Law, including all applicable securities laws. Awards may not be exercised, and Award Shares may not be transferred, in violation of Applicable Law. Thus, for example, Awards may not be exercised or issued unless: (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is then in effect with respect to the related Award Shares, or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, those Award Shares may be issued in accordance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. The failure or inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body the authority considered by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary or useful for the lawful issuance of any Award Shares or their subsequent transfer shall relieve the Company of any liability for failing to issue those Award Shares or permitting their transfer. As a condition to the exercise of any Award or the transfer of any Award Shares, the Company may require the Awardee to satisfy any requirements or qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate to comply with or evidence compliance with any Applicable Law. The Company shall have no liability to any Awardee or any party who might claim through the Awardee to the extent that the Awardee (or his or her permitted transferee) is required to forfeit
General.
 
an Award, or the benefits received or to be received under an Award, pursuant to any Applicable Law.
     13.2 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that the Administrator determines that any Award granted under the Plan is subject to Code Section 409A and unless otherwise specified in the applicable Award Agreement, the Award Agreement evidencing such Award shall incorporate the terms and conditions necessary for such Award to avoid the consequences described in Code Section 409A(a)(1), and to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law (and unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement), the Plan and the Award Agreements shall be interpreted in a manner that results in their conforming to the requirements of Code Section 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4) and any Department of Treasury or Internal Revenue Service regulations or other interpretive guidance issued under Section 409A (whenever issued, the "Guidance"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan (and unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise, with specific reference to this sentence), to the extent that a Participant holding an Award that constitutes "deferred compensation" under Section 409A and the Guidance is a "specified employee" (also as defined thereunder), no distribution or payment of any amount shall be made before a date that is six months following the date of such Participant's "separation from service" (as defined in Section 409A and the Guidance) or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death.
Tax Matters.
14.
Amendment or Termination of this Plan or Outstanding Awards
     14.1 The Board may at any time amend, suspend, or terminate this Plan.
Amendment and Termination.
     14.2 The Company shall obtain the approval of the Company's stockholders for any amendment to this Plan if stockholder approval is necessary or desirable to comply with any Applicable Law or with the requirements applicable to the grant of Awards intended to be Incentive Stock Options; that the Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any of the following: (a) other than an increase under Section 10.2, an increase to the Shares reserved for issuance hereunder; (b) an expansion of the class of persons eligible to receive Awards hereunder; or (c) any amendment of outstanding Options or SARs that effects a repricing of such Awards or other lowering of the original Option Price or grant date Fair Market Value that applies to a SAR. For Stock Awards to continue to be eligible to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m), the Company's stockholders must re-approve the material terms of the performance goals included in the Plan by the date of the first stockholder meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the stockholders first approved the Plan. The Board may also, but need not, require that the Company's stockholders approve any other amendments to this Plan.
Stockholder Approval.
provided however
     14.3 No amendment, suspension, or termination of this Plan, and no modification of any Award even in the absence of an amendment, suspension, or termination of this Plan, shall impair any existing contractual rights of any Awardee unless the affected Awardee consents to the amendment, suspension, termination, or modification. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such consent shall be required if the Board determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the amendment, suspension, termination, or modification: (a) is
Effect.
 
required or advisable in order for the Company, this Plan or the Award to satisfy Applicable Law, to meet the requirements of any accounting standard or to avoid any adverse accounting treatment, or (b) in connection with any transaction or event described in Section 10, is in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. The Board may, but need not, take the tax or accounting consequences to affected Awardees into consideration in acting under the preceding sentence. Those decisions shall be final, binding and conclusive. Termination of this Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it under this Plan with respect to Awards granted before the termination of Award Shares issued under such Awards even if those Award Shares are issued after the termination.
15.
Reserved Rights
     15.1 This Plan shall not limit the power of the Company or any Affiliate to adopt other incentive arrangements including, for example, the grant or issuance of stock options, stock, or other equity-based rights under other plans.
Nonexclusivity of this Plan.
     15.2 This Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Awardees, any such accounts will be used merely as a convenience. The Company shall not be required to segregate any assets on account of this Plan, the grant of Awards, or the issuance of Award Shares. The Company and the Administrator shall not be deemed to be a trustee of stock or cash to be awarded under this Plan. Any obligations of the Company to any Awardee shall be based solely upon contracts entered into under this Plan, such as Award Agreements. No such obligations shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any assets of the Company. Neither the Company nor the Administrator shall be required to give any security or bond for the performance of any such obligations.
Unfunded Plan.
16.
Special Arrangements Regarding Award Shares
     16.1 To enforce any restrictions on Award Shares, the Administrator may require their holder to deposit the certificates representing Award Shares, with stock powers or other transfer instruments approved by the Administrator endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent of the Company to hold in escrow until the restrictions have lapsed or terminated. The Administrator may also cause a legend or legends referencing the restrictions to be placed on the certificates.
Escrow of Stock Certificates.
16.2
Repurchase Rights.
               (a) . If a Stock Award is subject to vesting or other forfeiture conditions, the Company shall have the right, during such period after the Awardee's Termination as is specified by the Administrator to repurchase any or all of the Award Shares that were unvested or otherwise subject to forfeiture as of the date of that Termination. The repurchase price shall be such price as is determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement, subject to adjustment under Section 10. The repurchase price shall be paid in cash. The Company may assign this right of repurchase.
General
               (b) . The Company or its assignee may choose to give the Awardee a written notice of exercise of its repurchase rights under this Section 16.2. However, the
Procedure
 
Company's failure to give such a notice shall not affect its rights to repurchase Award Shares. The Company must, however, tender the repurchase price during the period specified in this Section 16.2 for exercising its repurchase rights in order to exercise such rights.
     16.3 The Administrator may in its discretion and upon such terms and conditions as it determines appropriate permit one or more Participants whom it selects to (a) defer compensation payable pursuant to the terms of an Award, or (b) defer compensation arising outside the terms of this Plan pursuant to a program that provides for deferred payment in satisfaction of such other compensation amounts through the issuance of one or more Awards. Any such deferral arrangement shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in such form as the Administrator shall from time to time establish, and no such deferral arrangement shall be a valid and binding obligation unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement, the form of which the Administrator has approved, including through the Administrator's establishing a written program (the "Program") under this Plan to govern the form of Award Agreements participating in such Program. Any such Award Agreement or Program shall specify the treatment of dividends or dividend equivalent rights (if any) that apply to Awards governed thereby, and shall further provide that any elections governing payment of amounts pursuant to such Program shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the Company or its agent in a form and manner that complies with Code Section 409A and the Guidance, and shall specify the amount to be distributed in settlement of the deferral arrangement, as well as the time and form of such distribution in a manner required by the Administrator, and shall specify the amount to be distributed in settlement of the deferral arrangement, as well as the time and form of such distribution.
Deferral of Award Benefits.
     Time or performance-based vesting or forfeiture restrictions shall not be waived on greater than five percent (5%) of the total number of Award Shares set forth in Section 3.1 (as such section may be amended from time to time), subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 10 (the "Waiver Limit"), other than due to a change of control or a change in status due to a Participant's death, disability, retirement or other exigent circumstances as determined by the Board, the Committee or the Administrator. Final determination as to whether a particular waiver will be made and is subject to the Waiver Limit shall be at the discretion of the Board, the Committee or the Administrator.
16.4 Limit to Waivers of Vesting or Forfeiture Conditions.
17.
Beneficiaries
     An Awardee may file a written designation of one or more beneficiaries who are to receive the Awardee's rights under the Awardee's Awards after the Awardee's death. An Awardee may change such a designation at any time by written notice. If an Awardee designates a beneficiary, the beneficiary may exercise the Awardee's Awards after the Awardee's death. If an Awardee dies when the Awardee has no living beneficiary designated under this Plan, the Company shall allow the executor or administrator of the Awardee's estate to exercise the Award or, if there is none, the person entitled to exercise the Option under the Awardee's will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided the Company may require of any such person, evidence of authority to act in such capacity as it deems appropriate. In any case, no Award may be exercised after its Expiration Date.
 
18.
Miscellaneous
     18.1 This Plan, the Award Agreements and all other agreements entered into under this Plan, and all actions taken under this Plan or in connection with Awards or Award Shares, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.
Governing Law.
     18.2 Fair Market Value shall be determined as follows:
Determination of Value.
               (a) . If the Shares are traded on any established stock exchange or quoted on a national market system, Fair Market Value shall be the closing sales price for the Shares as quoted on that stock exchange or system for the date the value is to be determined (the "") as reported in or a similar publication. If no sales are reported as having occurred on the Value Date, Fair Market Value shall be that closing sales price for the last preceding trading day on which sales of Shares are reported as having occurred. If no sales are reported as having occurred during the five trading days before the Value Date, Fair Market Value shall be the closing bid for Shares on the Value Date (or on the last preceding date on which a closing bid for the Shares was made). If Shares are listed on multiple exchanges or systems, Fair Market Value shall be based on sales or bid prices on the primary exchange or system on which Shares are traded or quoted.
Listed Stock
Value Date
The Wall Street Journal
               (b) . If Shares are regularly quoted by a recognized securities dealer but selling prices are not reported on any established stock exchange or quoted on a national market system, Fair Market Value shall be the mean between the high bid and low asked prices on the Value Date. If no prices are quoted for the Value Date, Fair Market Value shall be the mean between the high bid and low asked prices on the last preceding trading day on which any bid and asked prices were quoted.
Stock Quoted by Securities Dealer
               (c) . If Shares are not traded on any established stock exchange or quoted on a national market system and are not quoted by a recognized securities dealer, and unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, the Administrator (following guidelines established by the Board or Committee) will determine Fair Market Value in good faith using any reasonable valuation method. The Administrator will consider the following factors, and any others it considers significant, in determining Fair Market Value: (i) the price at which other securities of the Company have been issued to purchasers other than Employees, Directors, or Consultants, (ii) the Company's stockholder's equity, prospective earning power, dividend-paying capacity, present value of future cash flows, and value of tangible and intangible assets, if any, and (iii) any other relevant factors, including the economic outlook for the Company and the Company's industry, the Company's position in that industry, the Company's goodwill and other intellectual property, and the values of securities of other businesses in the same industry.
No Established Market
     18.3 During the term of this Plan, the Company shall at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as are still issuable under this Plan.
Reservation of Shares.

the extent determined by the Administrator, electronically. Signatures may also be electronic if permitted by the Administrator.
     18.5 Unless the Administrator specifies otherwise, any notice to the Company under any Option Agreement or with respect to any Awards or Award Shares shall be in writing (or, if so authorized by Section 18.4, communicated electronically), shall be addressed to the Secretary of the Company, and shall only be effective when received by the Secretary of the Company.
Notices.
 Adopted by the Board on August 15, 2006 and approved by the stockholders at 2006 annual meeting (November 2, 2006).
Initial Adoption
 During the pendency of the 2006 proxy solicitation, two institutional stockholders suggested changes to the plan. Stockholder approval of the Plan was obtained without regard to how the votes of such stockholders were cast. Nevertheless because the Board is willing to consider stockholder inputs when they are reasonable and consistent with the Company's business objectives, following the 2006 annual meeting, on November 2, 2006, the Board amended the Plan to add sections 11.2 ("Non-Employee Director Award Guidelines") and 16.4 ("Limit to Waivers of Vesting or Forfeiture Conditions"). (November 2, 2006).

1
James W. Bagley Employment Agreement Page
     This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between James W. Bagley (the "Executive"), a Texas resident, and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
     A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company.
     B. Certain capitalized terms used in the Agreement are defined in Section 6 below.
          In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
     1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
          (a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2 (a) below), the Executive shall serve as the Executive Chairman of the Company. The duties and responsibilities of Executive shall include diligent service on the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and the performance of such activities as the Board may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive. Based on the scope of Executive's duties, the Board shall from time to time determine Executive's status as a Section 16 officer, as defined by Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Position
          (b) . Executive shall comply with all of Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall not devote substantial business efforts and time to another for-profit enterprise other than his duties for Teradyne and Micron or any other activity that is pre-approved by the Board. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
     2. .
Employment Period
     (a) . This Agreement shall cover the period between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2009 unless earlier terminated as set forth herein (the "Employment Period"). The Employment Period may be extended with the mutual agreement of the Executive and the Board.
Term
     (b) . This Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration as follows:
Termination
          (i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 6(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure

James W. Bagley Employment Agreement Page
provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any other reason (which termination shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay out this period in lieu of such notice. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b). Termination under this section shall become effective at the end of the notice period (unless cured prior to the expiration of such period).
          (ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company at any time for any other reason ("Voluntary Resignation") by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b). Termination under this section shall become effective at the end of the notice period (unless cured prior to the expiration of such period).
By the Executive
          (iii) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
          (iv) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Disability (as defined in Section 6(b) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing. In the event the Executive resumes the performance of substantially all of his duties hereunder before the termination of his employment under this Section 2(b)(iv) becomes effective, the notice of termination shall automatically be deemed to have been revoked.
Disability
     (c)  The Shareholders of the Company may fail to elect Executive to the Board of Directors of the Company; while that action may terminate Executive's tenure on the Board of Directors, such action shall not terminate this Agreement or otherwise affect Executive's rights to compensation hereunder. During the Employment Period, Company will (A) recommend to the Nominating and Governance Committee and/or independent members of the Board that Executive be nominated to the Board of Directors, and (B) to the extent permitted by the Board and the proxies submitted by the shareholders, the Company shall exercise its proxies in such a manner as to secure Executive's election to the Board.
Shareholder Action.
     (d) If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) Termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation or Voluntary Termination of Entire Agreement by Executive; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination.

James W. Bagley Employment Agreement Page
Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
     (e) Should Executive be a member of the Company's Board of Directors at the time his employment terminates due to (i) Involuntary Termination, (ii) Voluntary Termination of Entire Agreement by Executive or (iii) termination for Cause, he shall immediately tender his resignation as a Board member, which resignation shall be accepted, or not, in the Board's discretion. This provision does not apply in the case of expiration of this Agreement at the end of the Employment Period.
     3. .
Compensation and Benefits
          (a) . The Executive's compensation during the term of this Agreement shall consist of (i) Salary, and (ii) Lump Sum Compensation, as described in Exhibit 1. Executive shall receive his Salary as long as he is employed by the Company during the Employment Period. The Salary and Lump Sum Compensation are defined in Exhibit 1 to this Agreement.
Base Compensation
          (b) Executive shall not be entitled to participate in any performance bonus plan offered by the Company.

          (c) . Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.

Benefits
          (e) . The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
          (f) Executive shall not be entitled to receive any stock option grants or other equity based compensation except as may be granted to him in the discretion of the independent members of the Board.

     4. .

          (a) In consideration of the Executive's agreement in subparagraph (b) below, the Company agrees that it will provide Executive with confidential information and trade secrets that are of substantial value to the Company during the Employment Period. Executive agrees not to use the Company's confidential information or trade secrets except as permitted by the Company. The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique, that the Company has a substantial interest in protecting its confidential information and trade secrets, and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not misappropriating the Company's trade secrets nor competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 9 is essential to protect the business, trade secrets and goodwill of the Company.
          (b) The Executive agrees that prior to March 31, 2009, the Executive will not either directly or indirectly, whether as a director, officer, consultant, employee or advisor or in any other capacity (i) render any planning, marketing, executive, operational or other services respecting the creation, design, manufacture or sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and/or software or the operation of such business to any business, agency, partnership or entity ("Restricted Business") other than the Company, or (ii) make or hold any investment in any Restricted Business in the United States other than the Company, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than 4% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation. For purposes of this Section 9, the term "Company" shall mean and include the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, any successor to the business of the Company (by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or stock or otherwise) and any other corporation or entity of which the Executive may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or any successor of the Company.
          (c) Prior to the Termination Date, and for the period extending six (6) months thereafter, the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Company to leave its employ, and the Executive will not, directly or indirectly, involve himself in decisions to hire any employee who has left the Company's employ within the three-month period preceding the Executive's cessation of employment or the three-month period following his cessation of employment.
          (d) The Executive agrees that the Company would suffer an irreparable injury if he were to breach the covenants contained in subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) and that the Company would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Executive hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
 
10
James W. Bagley Employment Agreement Page
          (e) If Executive violates any provision of this Section 9, he loses any right to any either the Salary or the Lump Sum Compensation elements of his Base Compensation or severance benefits. If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 9 shall be deemed to be unenforceable in any dispute between the parties in which Executive has performed an act in violation of such restriction, then the parties hereto contemplate that Executive shall waive his right to receive Base Compensation or other severance benefit described in Section 5 of this Agreement.
     10. .
Existing Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreements
          Executive represents and warrants (i) that prior to the date hereof he has provided the Company with true and complete copies of any and all written confidentiality and/or non-compete agreements to which Executive is a party as of the date hereof (together with a written description of any such oral agreements), and (ii) to the best of Executive's knowledge, full compliance with the terms of each such agreement will not materially interfere with Executive's duties hereunder (except to the extent that Executive reasonably may determine to absent himself from certain Company meetings and communication during the first year of the Employment Period). The Executive further covenants that he will not willfully and knowingly fail to fully abide by the terms of any and all such agreements and will work in good faith with the Company to avoid any breach thereof.
     11. .

          At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
          The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then an arbitrator shall be appointed by the Honorable Joseph Hart, retired judge of Travis County Superior Court, or, if the parties are unable to secure such appointment from Judge Hart, in any other manner mutually agreed to by the parties.

At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended
December 24, 2006
FREMONT, Calif., January 17, 2007 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2006 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended December 24, 2006. Revenue for the period was $633.4 million and net income was $167.3 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $604.4 million and net income of $183.5 million, or $1.27 per diluted share for the September 2006 quarter. Ongoing net income was $167.3 million, or $1.15 per diluted share in the December 2006 quarter compared with ongoing net income of $163.9 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the September 2006 quarter, reflecting the Company's investment in support of its long-term market share and product growth objectives.
Gross margin for the December 2006 quarter was $322.9 million, or 51.0 percent, compared to gross margin of $313.2 million, or 51.8 percent, for the September 2006 quarter. Operating expenses increased during the quarter to $128.4 million compared to operating expenses of $118.3 million for the September 2006 quarter, driven by investments supporting the Company's etch market share growth and new product development for markets adjacent to etch.
 
The Company's ongoing results exclude certain items noted below. Management uses the presentation of ongoing results to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends, comparing performance to prior periods, and enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing performance to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site. In the December 2006 quarter, there were no significant differences between the ongoing results and the results under GAAP. The September 2006 quarter ongoing presentation removes the effects of a legal judgment in favor of the Company of $15.8 million recorded in other income, net, which was previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2006, and the successful resolution of certain foreign tax matters resulting in a net tax benefit of $10.0 million.
New orders recorded in backlog increased 7 percent sequentially to $779 million. The geographic distribution of new orders and revenue during the December 2006 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.6 billion at the end of December, and cash flows provided by operating activities were $162.0 million during the quarter. Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included at the end of this press release. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $284.4 million and $176.8 million, respectively. At the end of the period, unshipped orders in backlog were approximately $719 million, and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $64 million.
"Lam Research demonstrated strong financial and operating performance in the December quarter across key metrics," stated Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer. "The results concluded what was an outstanding calendar 2006 in which the company generated record cash from operations, three consecutive quarters of 30 percent-plus operating margins, and 121 percent growth in operating income over calendar 2005. We saw significant market share gains in our etch markets and strong growth in our spares and services businesses reflecting the trust and confidence our customers have in Lam Research."
"In 2007 we will seek to continue achieving the benefits of our business model and expand upon the momentum in our core etch businesses. We are making excellent progress in our activities associated with our expansion into markets adjacent to etch and are confident that our new products will deliver the type of best-in-class, yield enhancing results that our customers have come to expect from Lam Research," Newberry concluded.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the First Half of Calendar Year 2007
          On January 15, 2007, based upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") established performance goals under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for the first half of calendar year 2007 for Stephen G. Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin and operating profit targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives. Mr. Newberry's target incentive amount is 100% of his salary. Actual incentive awards may range from zero to 2.55 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the incentive plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met.
          On January 15, 2007, the Committee also established corporate performance goals for the first half of its calendar year 2007 incentive plan for its named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, including Martin B. Anstice, Nicolas J. Bright and Ernest E. Maddock. The 2007 incentive plan provides for the payment of incentive bonuses upon achievement of certain corporate, organizational and individual performance objectives. The corporate performance objective is based on the Company's operating profit. Each officer was assigned a target percentage of his or her base salary for the period, and the calculated incentive amounts may range from zero to 2.55 times the target amounts based on the achievement of the specified performance objectives. The calculated bonus amounts will vary to the extent that the actual performance exceeds or falls below performance targets. The amount of the final incentive payments is subject to the discretion of the Committee and may vary from the calculated incentive amount. The performance goals established for the first half of the year shall continue for the second half of the year unless the Committee determines to revise the goals for the second half of 2007.
Adoption of Multi-Year Cash Incentive Plan Performance Goals
          On January 15, 2007, based on the recommendations of the Committee, the Board established performance goals and award amounts for 2007, the second calendar year of its 2006/2007 Multi-Year Incentive Plan ("2006/2007 MYIP") and the first calendar year of its 2007/2008 Multi-Year Incentive Plan ("2007/2008 MYIP") for Mr. Newberry. The Committee also established performance goals and award amounts for the second calendar year of the 2006/2007 MYIP and the first calendar year of the 2007/2008 MYIP for the Company's named executive officers listed above.
          The 2006/2007 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2006 and 2007, and awards will vest and be paid in 2008. The 2007/2008 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2007 and 2008, and awards will vest and be paid in 2009.
          Award amounts will be calculated quarterly based on Lam's operating profits and the amounts so calculated may be enhanced based upon a stock price performance factor.
           Individual target amounts based upon revenue targets were established for each participant. Actual award accruals may vary from 0 to approximately 2.5 times the target amounts depending upon the operating profit and stock performance metrics, as applicable. The Committee also retains discretion to reduce amounts that would otherwise be accrued under the programs.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     Lam Research Corporation ("Lam" or the "Company") has commenced a voluntary internal review of the accounting and reporting related to Company grants of employee stock options and the procedures under which those grants were made. Questions have arisen as to whether the appropriate accounting measurement dates for certain employee stock option grants between 1999 and 2002 were selected. The voluntary review arose after the Company's independent auditors performed auditing processes, pursuant to recent guidance from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), relating to the Company's historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of its fiscal year-end 2007 audit. Lam's Board of Directors has appointed an independent committee of two independent board members to conduct the review. The independent committee has engaged independent outside legal counsel to assist with the review. The scope of the voluntary review will be determined by the independent committee in consultation with its independent outside counsel.
     The Company has not yet determined whether it needs to record any non-cash adjustments to compensation expense related to prior stock option grants. While it conducts the review, the Company will provide only selected financial information to the public.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Selected Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 24, 2007
FREMONT, Calif., July 24, 2007 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced selected financial results for the quarter ended June 24, 2007.
Revenue for the period was $678.5 million compared to revenue of $650.3 million for the March 2007 quarter. Shipments for the June 2007 quarter were approximately $694 million compared to March 2007 quarter shipments of approximately $620 million.
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2007 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.0 billion at the end of June. The Company repurchased approximately $768 million of its common stock during the quarter resulting in the completion of the Company's currently available repurchase authorizations. During the June 2007 quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $14 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans were $19 million. Total shares outstanding as of June 24, 2007 were 123,535,328. At the end of the period, deferred revenue was $295.5 million and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $51.1 million.
"Our strong shipment and revenue performance for the June quarter is indicative of continued operational and financial execution at Lam Research," said Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer. "While the near term environment is expected to be characterized by a slowing of the rate of capacity expansion in memory, we believe the long-term semiconductor unit demand outlook remains favorable and that Lam is in excellent position to execute on its strategic objectives of maintaining and building on its existing leadership positions in its core etch business; expanding its served available market through entry into markets adjacent to etch, and delivering strong cash flows," Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers, our expectations of future shipments and revenues, our anticipated operational and financial performance, our customers' capacity expansions, the long term demand for semiconductors and our ability to maintain and build on our leadership positions in core etch, to expand our served available markets and to maintain strong cash flows. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, including fluctuations in overall demand which could affect our financial results in particular fiscal periods, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the technical challenges presented by our new products. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 25, 2006, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 25, 2007, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations.

Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the Second Half of Calendar Year 2007
     On August 6, 2007, based upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Lam Research Corporation established its corporate performance goal under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for the second half of calendar year 2007 for Stephen G. Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer based on operating profit objectives. Individual performance goals including financial and other objectives established for Mr. Newberry in January 2007 remain in effect for the second half of calendar year 2007. Financial goals that continue in effect for the second half of calendar year 2007 include revenue, gross margin and cash generation targets. Non-financial targets include certain market position objectives. Mr. Newberry's target incentive amount is 100% of his salary. The range for actual incentive awards, from zero to 2.4 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors, is the same for the second half of calendar year 2007 as it was for the first half. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the incentive plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met.
     On August 6, 2007, the Committee also confirmed that corporate performance goals established for the first half of its calendar year 2007 incentive plan for its named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, including Martin B. Anstice and Ernest E. Maddock, would continue for the second half of the year. The 2007 incentive plan provides for the payment of incentive bonuses upon achievement of certain corporate, organizational and individual performance objectives. The corporate performance objective is based on the Company's operating profit. Each officer was assigned a target percentage of his or her base salary for the period, and the calculated incentive amounts, which may range from zero to 2.4 times the target amounts based on the achievement of the specified performance objectives, are the same for the second half of calendar year 2007 as they were for the first half. The calculated bonus amounts will vary to the extent that the actual performance exceeds or falls below performance targets. The amount of the final incentive payments is subject to the discretion of the Committee and may vary from the calculated incentive amount.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Request for a Hearing Before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel
FREMONT, Calif., August 29, 2007Lam Research Corporation today announced that it will request a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel in response to the receipt of a Nasdaq Staff Determination letter dated August 27, 2007 indicating that the Company is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). The letter, which the Company had expected, was issued in accordance with Nasdaq procedures due to the delayed filing of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007. Pending a decision by the Panel, Lam shares will remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
As the Company has previously disclosed, an independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors, composed of two independent board members appointed by the Board of Directors, is conducting a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The voluntary review arose after the Company's independent auditors performed auditing processes, pursuant to recent guidance from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), relating to the Company's historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of its fiscal year-end 2007 audit. The Independent Committee is working with independent outside legal counsel to complete this review as quickly as possible. At this time the review is ongoing and the Company will not be in a position to file the Form 10-K until after the completion of the review and until the Company can determine whether it needs to record any non-cash adjustments to compensation expense related to prior stock option grants.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the continued listing of the Company's common stock on Nasdaq and the Independent Committee review. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition including, without limitation, the timing of the completion of the Independent Committee review and the Company's ability to make filings of its periodic reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K with the SEC.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Selected Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 23, 2007
FREMONT, Calif., October 10, 2007Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced selected financial results for the quarter ended September 23, 2007. Highlights for the September 2007 quarter were:
Revenue for the period was $684.6 million compared to revenue of $678.5 million for the June 2007 quarter. Shipments for the September 2007 quarter were approximately $621 million compared to June 2007 quarter shipments of approximately $694 million. The amounts for cost of goods sold, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income and income before income taxes for the September quarter are preliminary due to the ongoing voluntary internal stock option review and could be subject to adjustment. Preliminary gross margin was $343.9 million, or 50.2% of revenue and preliminary operating income was $197.9 million, or 28.9% of revenue for the September 2007 quarter. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses is $3.1 million in legal costs incurred during the September 2007 quarter as a result of the voluntary internal stock option review.
The Company's ongoing results exclude the cost of legal expenses incurred as a result of its voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing results to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends, comparing performance to prior periods, and enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing performance to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
 
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the September 2007 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.3 billion at the end of September. During the September 2007 quarter, capital expenditures were $11.4 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans were $14.0 million. Total shares outstanding as of September 23, 2007 were 124,499,377. At the end of the period, deferred revenue was $225.6 million and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $62 million.
"Lam Research produced another strong quarter, driven by sound operational execution and continued market share gains. We have enjoyed significant success in enhancing our market position at the leading edge, winning a number of new applications and executing to our customers' most critical challenges," said Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer. "Our results continue to keep pace with the long term strategic and financial objectives that we have set out for Lam," Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers and continuing performance to our long-term strategic and financial objectives. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, including fluctuations in overall demand which could affect our financial results in particular fiscal periods, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the technical challenges presented by our new products. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 25, 2006, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 25, 2007, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.
As the Company announced on July 17, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors has appointed an Independent Committee to review the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. On August 24, 2007 the Company filed Form 12b-25 as notification that the Company is unable to timely file its Form 10-K for the period ended June 24, 2007 as a result of the pending review. Because the review has not been completed and because the Company's auditors have not yet completed their review, the Company is only able to provide preliminary results for cost of goods sold, gross margins, operating expenses, operating income and income before income taxes for the period presented in this release at this time. These preliminary results may be subject to adjustment. Further, the Company cannot make assurances that the outcome of the review will not result in changes to or a restatement of its financial results for this or any historical period, that its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 23, 2007 will be timely filed, that the Company will be able to give timely guidance with respect to future periods or that it will not be required to make changes to its internal controls or processes.

     During the blackout period and for a period of two years after the ending date thereof, a participant in the 401(k) Plan, a security holder, or other interested person may obtain, without charge, information regarding the blackout period, including the actual ending date of the blackout period, by contacting George Schisler, Vice President and General Counsel, at Lam Research Corporation, 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538; telephone number (510) 572-6467.

Exhibit 99.1
TO: LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND BOARD MEMBERS RE: SARBANES-OXLEY BLACKOUT PERIOD DATED: OCTOBER 10, 2007
As you know, on August 24, 2007, Lam Research Corporation filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that it would be unable to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007 until completion of a review by an independent committee of our Board of Directors ("Independent Committee") of our historical stock option practices and related accounting. As a result of the delay in filing our annual report on Form 10-K and the likelihood that the Independent Committee review will not be completed by October 25, 2007 when the financial statements incorporated into our registration statements must be updated, we have determined that we will be required to suspend operation of all registration statements filed with the SEC no later than on October 25, 2007. Additionally, we may have to suspend our registration statements sooner if, prior to that date, the Independent Committee determines that our previously filed financial statements can no longer be relied upon.
This suspension of our registration statements on Form S-8 for our employee stock plans has substantial implications for the Company's various equity incentive programs and your ability to engage in transactions involving the Company's common stock. You are currently under a Company-imposed black-out on your ability to trade in the Company's common stock in open-market transactions, but as a result of the impact which the suspension of our registration statements on Form S-8 will have upon certain employee stock programs, including the Company's 401(k) Savings Plus Plan, you will now also be subject to the restrictions of Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which prohibits you from purchasing, selling, acquiring or transferring any equity securities of the Company, to the extent those securities were acquired in connection with your service as an executive officer or Board member. These restrictions apply to you and your family members. Although this restriction does not apply to transactions involving equity securities that were not acquired in connection with your services as a director or executive officer, there is a presumption that any such transactions are prohibited unless you can identify the source of the shares and show that you used the same identification for all related purposes, such as tax reporting and disclosure requirements.
Shares of the Company's common stock can only be issued under the Company's equity incentive programs pursuant to an effective registration statement under the federal securities laws. The Company currently has S-8 registration statements on file with the SEC covering the shares of common stock issuable under those programs. However, the S-8 registration statements incorporate historical financial statements that must be updated periodically. Because we have been unable to file audited annual financial statements for the year ended June 24, 2007, we will be unable to issue shares of our common stock under our registration statements commencing on October 25, 2007. Additionally, if the Independent Committee determines prior to that date that we can on longer rely on our historical financial statements that are currently incorporated into our registration statements, we will have to suspend issuance of shares under our registration statements earlier. For that reason, participation in the various equity incentive programs covered by those S-8 registration statements must be suspended. The suspension period will begin at 12:01 AM., Pacific Time October 25, 2007 (or earlier, if the Independent Committee determines that we can no longer rely upon our historical financial statements) and will continue until 9:00 AM Pacific Time of the day immediately following the day on which we become current in our filings with the SEC.
Your participation in the Company's equity incentive plans will accordingly be affected as follows:
     During the suspension period, the executive officers will be precluded from directing the investment of their 401(k) plan contributions into shares of the Company's common stock or from moving their existing account balance under the plan into the Company common stock fund. All other participants in the 401(k) plan will also be subject to the same restrictions while the suspension period remains in effect. In addition, to the extent one or more executive officers may have their 401(k) account currently invested in the Company common stock fund, they will not be allowed during the suspension period to liquidate that investment and move it into
4
01(k)
Plan:
 
another available investment fund. New contributions by executive officers to their 401(k) accounts that would otherwise have been allocated to the Lam Stock Fund will be allocated elsewhere.
     No exercises of outstanding options including exercise and hold and same-day exercise and sale transactions, can occur during the suspension period, and no shares will be issued under restricted stock unit awards that may vest during the suspension period.
Stock Option Plans:
     No further contributions can be made to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") during the suspension period. If you are currently a participant in the ESPP, you may request a refund of any payroll deductions you have made to date for the current purchase period. However if you do withdraw those contributions, then you would immediately cease participation in the ESPP and could not rejoin the plan until the next scheduled entry date, at which time a new maximum purchase price would be set for you. Should you leave your existing contributions for the purchase period in the plan, then those contributions would be applied to the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock at the end of the current purchase period, provided the S-8 registration statement is reactivated at that time; otherwise, the purchase date will have to be deferred until the S-8 is reactivated. You would continue to have the right to request a refund of your existing contributions during the suspension period.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan:
As a result of the foregoing blackout period under the 401(k) Plan, executive officers and Board members will be prohibited pursuant to Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act from purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring any shares of the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the Company's common stock (such as put or call options or pre-paid variable forward sale contracts) during the blackout period in effect under the 401(k) plan. The prohibition covers any acquisition of the Company's common stock or derivative security in connection with the covered individual's service or employment with the Company (e.g., an option grant or restricted stock unit award) or any sale of the Company's common stock which the executive officer or Board member acquired in connection with his or her service in such capacity (e.g., through the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units).
Because of the complexity of the Sarbanes-Oxley prohibition, executive officers and Board members are strongly advised not to engage in any transactions involving the Company's common stock or any derivative security tied to the value of the stock during the suspension period.
The Company can provide no assurances as to when the necessary financial statements will be completed and filed with the SEC. However, the Company will notify you promptly when the S-8 registration statements are re-activated and the Sarbanes-Oxley blackout period ends.
If you have any questions concerning the suspension period or the Sarbanes-Oxley prohibition on transactions involving the Company's common stock or any related derivative security, please contact George Schisler, Vice President and General Counsel, at the Company's headquarters at 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, CA 94538 or by telephoning him at 510-572-6467.

Lam Research Corporation today announced that it is in receipt of an additional Nasdaq Staff Determination letter dated November 7, 2007, advising Lam that it is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). The letter, which the Company had expected, was issued in accordance with standard Nasdaq procedures due to the delayed filing of Lam's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 23, 2007. This follows a similar letter received on August 27, 2007 indicating that Lam was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing due to the delayed filing of Lam's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007. Lam plans to present its views with respect to this additional deficiency to the Nasdaq Listing Qualification Panel (the "Panel") in writing no later than November 14, 2007.
Lam previously announced its intention to request a hearing before the Panel and was granted a hearing that was held on October 11, 2007, in which Lam's management presented its plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq's filing requirements with respect to the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Pending a decision of the Panel, Lam's shares will continue to be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant Lam's request for an extension that would allow the continued listing of Lam's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
As the Company has previously disclosed, an independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors, composed of two independent board members appointed by the Board of Directors, is conducting a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting.

On December 10, 2007, Lam Research Corporation ("Lam Research") entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SEZ Holding AG ("SEZ") pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement by and between Lam Research and SEZ (the "Transaction Agreement").
Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Lam Research will offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of SEZ in an all cash transaction at a price of CHF 38 per share. Lam Research has agreed to pay CHF 641 million, which approximates US$568 million at the current exchange rate. Net of cash acquired, the purchase price approximates US$447 million.
The acquisition is expected to close in the March 2008 quarter, subject to the receipt of approval by the shareholders of SEZ, certain regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of certain other closing conditions.
The foregoing description of the Transaction Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.110 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
On December 10, 2007 (Pacific time), a "pre-announcement" and two press releases, one from Lam Research and one from SEZ were published in Switzerland.

On 10 December 2007, Lam and SEZ entered into a Transaction Agreement providing for the public tender offer herewith announced. Both, Lam and SEZ are convinced that the combination of the two groups strengthens their market position. The combined entity will in particular profit from the complementary set of products and the expected leverage from distribution and aftermarket services. Further, the positive interaction between the development teams of both groups is anticipated to result in faster and more comprehensive developments in favor of the customers.
The public tender offer (the Offer) Lam will submit will extend to all publicly held registered shares of SEZ with a par-value of CHF 1 each (SEZ Shares). Additionally, the Offer extends to new SEZ Shares issued until the end of the additional offer period due to the exercise of options. The following will be the main terms and conditions of the Offer:
Price of the Offer
The net Offer price per SEZ Share will correspond to CHF 38 (Offer Price). The Offer Price is reduced by the gross amount of any dilution effects (e.g. dividend payments, repayments of capital, any other distribution, capital increases with an issue price of the shares below the offer price, sales of treasury shares below the offer price, issuance of options below faire market value of the option) becoming effective prior to the settlement of the Offer. The exercise of the currently outstanding employee stock options and the delivery of the corresponding number of SEZ Shares does not lead to an adaptation of the Offer Price.
Offer Period
The Offer is expected to be published on 8 January 2008. It is planned to leave the Offer open for acceptance for 20 trading days. Lam reserves the right to extend the offer period. Tenders will only be solicited once the Offer is published. Such Offer will also contain instructions on how tenders shall be made.
Conditions
The Offer will be subject to the following conditions (whereby the conditions a and b will be conditions precedent, while the conditions c through g will initially be conditions precedent and, after the Offer has been declared successful, become conditions subsequent):
 
 
Should one or several of the condition c) through g) above not have been met by the end of the (possibly extended) offer period and should Lam not have waived such condition(s), Lam is entitled:
Lam reserves the right to waive all or part of the conditions.
Further Information
It is expected that detailed information regarding the Offer will be published at the same place on 8 January 2008.

with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. U.S. holders of SEZ Shares are encouraged to consult with their own Swiss advisors in connection with the Offer.
Lam and any of their respective subsidiaries and any advisor, broker or financial institution acting as an agent or for the account or benefit of Lam may, subject to applicable Swiss and U.S. securities laws, rules and regulations and pursuant to exemptive relief granted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from Rule 14e-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, SEZ Shares from SEZ shareholders who are willing to sell their SEZ Shares outside the Offer from time to time, including purchases in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Lam will disclose promptly any information regarding such purchases of SEZ Shares in Switzerland through the electronic media and/or the stock exchange and in the United States by means of a press release, if and to the extent required under applicable laws, rules and regulations in Switzerland.
OFFER RESTRICTIONS

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES INTENT TO ACQUIRE THE SEZ GROUP
Transaction will Create the Largest and Most Comprehensive Set of Advanced Technology Solutions for Single Wafer Cleaning.
FREMONT, Calif., December 10, 2007Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the SEZ Group (SWX: SEZN), the leading supplier of single wafer clean technology and products to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. In an all cash transaction, Lam Research has agreed to pay CHF 641 million, which approximates US$568 million at the current exchange rate. Net of cash acquired, the purchase price approximates US$447 million. Lam will effect the acquisition by offering to acquire, as provided in the agreement, all of the outstanding shares of SEZ at a price of CHF 38 per share.
SEZ's proprietary Spin-Process single wafer technology forms the basis of a broad equipment solution portfolio for wafer cleaning and decontamination, a key process adjacent to etch where Lam Research is the global market share leader. SEZ is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland and maintains development, manufacturing, sales, marketing and service operations in Europe, Asia and North America. For 2007, SEZ currently expects to record total revenues of approximately CHF 330 million (US$293 million).
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Lam Research will offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of SEZ, and therefore effectively all of its assets, including its principal facilities in Villach, Austria.

SEZ executive team members, including chairman and chief executive officer Egon Putzi, will continue with the Company under Lam's ownership. The transaction is expected to close in the March 2008 quarter, subject to the receipt of SEZ's shareholder and certain regulatory approvals, and is targeted to be neutral to slightly accretive depending on synergies realized in calendar 2008.
"This transaction positions Lam Research and SEZ to revolutionize the increasingly important area of wafer cleaning, combining the world's largest single wafer installed base with Lam's emerging clean technologies, process integration capabilities and global scale," stated Steve Newberry, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lam Research. "Together, Lam and SEZ will create a stronger, established presence in the clean segment of the wafer fab equipment industry with the ability to deliver the broadest set of leading edge high productivity clean solutions to our customers. In addition, we will increase our ability to support our customers' needs in solving the technical challenges of post etch and strip yield issues present in today's most advanced semiconductor devices. Through our combined strengths we will increase our capability to provide single wafer clean solutions, utilizing both spin and linear wet clean technologies as well as our plasma etch based bevel cleaning capability. At Lam, we are committed to executing on our multi-product, multi-market growth strategy, and this transaction facilitates our progress in achieving our stated goals. We have been very impressed by the quality of SEZ's operational and engineering capabilities, as well as the caliber of its management team and employees, making them the perfect addition to our Company," Newberry concluded.

Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On December 12, 2007, the Board of Directors of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to comply with a NASDAQ listing requirement that all listed companies be eligible for a Direct Registration System ("DRS") no later than January 1, 2008. The amendment was made to revise Section 8.3 of the Bylaws to remove a provision requiring the Company to issue a stock certificate, at the request of a stockholder, for shares of stock held in uncertificated form, so as to make the Company eligible to participate in the DRS administered by The Depository Trust Company.
The description of the changes to the Bylaws contained in this report is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Section 8.3 of the prior Bylaws, a copy of which was filed with the Commission on June 30, 2005 as Exhibit 3.2 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference, and the amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.4 and incorporated herein by reference.

     The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Corporation are hereby amended, effective as of the date set forth above
:
     ARTICLE VIII, Section 8.3, :
is hereby amended to read as follows
          8.3. STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES
The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors may establish by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the corporation's stock shall be issued or issuable as uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form.

The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

Item 1.01. Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.
     On December 18, 2007, the Company entered into a series of two operating leases (the "Livermore Leases") regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, the Company entered into a series of four operating leases (the "New Fremont Leases," and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the "Operating Leases") which assigned, amended and restated the Company's existing operating leases with SELCO Service Corporation with regard to certain improved properties at the Company's headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off-balance sheet arrangement.
     The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by the Company and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation ("BNPPLC").
     Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial construction period during which BNPPLC's and the Company's obligations will be governed by the Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the Livermore Leases are estimated to be approximately $25,700,000 in the aggregate (based on current one-month LIBOR rates), following completion of improvements to each property.
     Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term ending on the first business day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the New Fremont Leases are approximately $32,400,000 in the aggregate (based upon current three-month LIBOR rates).
     Under each Operating Lease, the Company may, at its discretion and with 30 days' notice, elect to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC's investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of prepayment.
     The Company is required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165,000,000 (upon completion of the Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts with BNPPLC (or a third party, currently State Street Bank and Trust, with regard to the Livermore Leases) as security for the Company's obligations under the Operating Leases.
     Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating Lease may be remarketed. The Company has guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee made by the Company under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141,800,000 (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of BNPPLC's investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees will be no more than $165,000,000 plus related indemnification or other obligations).
     Under each Operating Lease and its associated documents, the Company is subject to a financial covenant requiring it to maintain unrestricted cash, unencumbered cash investments, and unencumbered marketable securities of at least $300,000,000 (not including the collateral maintained as security for the Company's obligations under the Operating Leases).
     The Operating Leases are subject to customary default provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the Operating Leases and associated documents, payment defaults under other indebtedness of the Company, performance defaults under the Operating Leases (including cross-defaults between each of the Operating Leases), and events of bankruptcy. In the event that such defaults occur and are continuing, BNPPLC may accelerate repayment of its investment under the applicable Operating Leases; alternatively, BNPPLC may require the Company to pay all amounts due under one or more Operating Leases through the end of the term of the applicable Operating Leases.

Item 4.02. Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously announced by Lam Research Corporation (the "Company"), an independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors, composed of two independent board members appointed by the Board of Directors, has been conducting a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The independent committee, with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel, has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. The independent committee's assessment of conduct relating to the Company's historical stock option practices is ongoing. The committee's preliminary view is that there was no intentional misconduct by management.
On December 18, 2007, upon the recommendation of management and the independent committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to restate certain of its previously-issued financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. The significant majority of the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. The Company has not determined the final amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which specific periods require restatement.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements
FREMONT, Calif., December 21, 2007  Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) announced earlier this year that an independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors, had begun a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting.
The independent committee, with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel, has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. The independent committee's assessment of conduct relating to the Company's historical stock option practices is ongoing. The committee's preliminary view is that there was no intentional misconduct by management.
On December 18, 2007, upon the recommendation of management and the independent committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to restate certain of its previously-issued financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. The significant majority of the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003.
 
The Company has not determined the final amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which specific periods require restatement.
The Company's management and the independent committee have discussed this matter with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company is working with Ernst & Young LLP to complete its restatement and become current with its public filings as soon as possible.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the final conclusions of the Company, its Board of Directors, the Special Committee, the Board Audit Committee, and the Company's independent registered public accountants concerning matters related to the Company's stock option grants and which, if any, of its previously issued financial statements will be restated or in what amounts. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the discovery of new facts relating to the Company's stock option grants, differing judgments on how to interpret new or currently known facts and changes in the laws or regulations relating to the accounting treatment of these grants or the interpretation of such laws or regulations. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents
 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 25, 2006, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 25, 2007, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Selected Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 23, 2007
FREMONT, Calif., January 24, 2008Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced selected financial results for the quarter ended December 23, 2007. Highlights for the December 2007 quarter were:
Revenue for the period was $610.3 million compared to revenue of $684.6 million for the September 2007 quarter. Shipments for the December 2007 quarter were approximately $593 million compared to September 2007 quarter shipments of approximately $621 million. The amounts for cost of goods sold, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income and income before income taxes for the December and September 2007 quarters are preliminary due to the ongoing voluntary internal stock option review and could be subject to adjustment. Gross margin for the December 2007 quarter was $307.7 million, or 50.4% of revenue, compared to $343.9 million, or 50.2% of revenue, for the September 2007 quarter. Operating income for the December 2007 quarter was $161.3 million, or 26.4% of revenue, compared to $197.9 million, or 28.9% of revenue, for the September 2007 quarter.
The Company's ongoing operating income excludes legal and accounting expenses of $6.4 million and $3.1 million for the December 2007 and September 2007 quarters, respectively, incurred as a result of its voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing operating income to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing operating income is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends, comparing performance to prior periods, and enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing operating income to results under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
 
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2007 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.3 billion at the end of December. During the December 2007 quarter, capital expenditures were $24.4 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans were $3.4 million. Total shares outstanding as of December 23, 2007 were 124,753,459. At the end of the period, deferred revenue was $229.6 million and the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $41 million.
"Lam delivered financial performance in the December quarter that exceeded our guidance despite difficult industry conditions, and finished calendar 2007 with record revenue of $2.6 billion," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer of Lam Research. "We continue to make excellent progress in implementing our adjacent market strategy, with three new product releases in 2007 and our announced plan to acquire the SEZ Group, which together will enhance our ability to offer our customers a broader spectrum of solutions across multiple markets at the next-generation technology nodes."
"Our employees' outstanding performance and their commitment to setting the standard of excellence for the wafer fab equipment industry will position us to continue generating value for our customers and stakeholders throughout 2008," Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers, the progress and success of our adjacent market strategy, the completion of our acquisition of SEZ and our combined capabilities, our ability to generate value and continuing performance to our near-term and long-term strategic and financial objectives. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those changes, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the response of SEZ's shareholders to our tender offer. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 25, 2006, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 25, 2007, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.
 
As the Company announced on July 17, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors has appointed an Independent Committee to review the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. On August 24, 2007 the Company filed Form 12b-25 as notification that the Company is unable to timely file its Form 10-K for the period ended June 24, 2007 as a result of the pending review. On November 5, 2007 the Company filed Form 12b-25 as notification that the Company is unable to timely file its Form 10-Q for the period ended September 23, 2007 as a result of the pending review. On December 24, 2007, the Company filed a Form 8-K as notification that the independent committee, with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel, had reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards and that upon the recommendation of management and the independent committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to restate certain of its previously-issued financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. Because the review has not been completed and because the Company's auditors have not yet completed their review, the Company is only able to provide preliminary results for cost of goods sold, gross margins, operating expenses, operating income and income before income taxes for the period presented in this release at this time. These preliminary results may be subject to adjustment. Further, the Company cannot make assurances that the outcome of the review will not result in changes to or a restatement of its financial results for this or any historical period, that its Form 10-Q for the period ended December 23, 2007 will be timely filed, that the Company will be able to give timely guidance with respect to future periods or that it will not be required to make changes to its internal controls or processes.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for the First Half of Calendar Year 2008
     On January 31, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") established corporate performance goals for the first half of its calendar year 2008 incentive plan for certain of its officers other than the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman, including Martin B. Anstice, Abdi Hariri, Thomas J. Bondur, Richard A. Gottscho and Ernest E. Maddock as well as certain other non-executive officers. The 2008 incentive plan provides for the payment of incentive bonuses upon achievement of certain corporate, organizational and individual performance objectives. The corporate performance objective is based on the Company's operating profit. Each officer was assigned a target percentage of his or her base salary for the period, and the calculated incentive amounts may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amounts based on the achievement of the specified performance objectives. The calculated bonus amounts will vary to the extent that the actual performance exceeds or falls below performance targets. The amount of the final incentive payments is subject to the discretion of the Committee and may vary from the calculated incentive amount. The performance goals established for the first half of the year shall continue for the second half of the year unless the Committee determines to revise the goals for the second half of 2008.
Adoption of Multi-Year Cash Incentive Plan Performance Goals
     On January 31, 2008, the Committee also established performance goals and award amounts for 2008, the second calendar year of its 2007/2008 Multi-Year Incentive Plan ("2007/2008 MYIP") and the first calendar year of its 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Plan ("2008/2009 MYIP") for Mr. Anstice, Mr. Hariri, Mr. Bondur, Mr. Gottscho and Mr. Maddock and certain other officers.
     The 2007/2008 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2007 and 2008, and awards will vest and be paid in 2009. The 2008/2009 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2008 and 2009, and awards will vest and be paid in 2010.
     Award amounts will be calculated quarterly based on Lam's operating profits and the amounts so calculated may be enhanced based upon a stock price performance factor.
     Individual target amounts, based upon a multiple of each individual participant's salary, were established for each participant. Actual award accruals may vary from 0 to approximately 2.5 times the target amounts depending upon the operating profit and stock performance metrics, as applicable. The Committee also retains discretion to reduce amounts that would otherwise be accrued under the programs.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 3.01. Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
Lam Research Corporation today announced that it is in receipt of an Additional Staff Determination letter from NASDAQ Staff dated February 5, 2008, advising Lam that it is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). The letter, which the Company had expected, was issued in accordance with standard NASDAQ procedures due to the delayed filing of Lam's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 23, 2007. This follows similar letters received on November 7, 2007 indicating that Lam was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing due to the delayed filing of Lam's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 23, 2007 and on August 27, 2007 indicating that Lam was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing due to the delayed filing of Lam's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007.
On October 11, 2007, Lam Research attended a hearing before the Panel at which Lam's management presented its plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements. Following the hearing, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing, subject to certain requirements. As amended, the Panel's decision requires, among other things, that the Company file with the Securities and Exchange Commission the delayed reports by February 13, 2008. Under applicable NASDAQ rules, this date represents the full extent of the Panel's discretion to grant an exception with respect to the delayed filings. On February 6, 2008, Lam requested that the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council call for review the Panel's decision and in connection therewith, grant a stay of delisting of the Company. If Lam's request is granted, Lam's shares will continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market pending the outcome of such review. In the event that the Panel's decision is not called for review and a stay is not granted and that the Company is unable to file the delayed reports by February 13, 2008, Lam's common stock would be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Global Select Market.

As previously disclosed by the Company, an independent committee of the Company's Board of Directors, composed of two independent board members appointed by the Board of Directors, is conducting a review of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting. The voluntary review arose after the Company's independent auditors performed auditing processes, pursuant to recent guidance from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, relating to the Company's historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of its fiscal year-end 2007 audit. The independent committee, with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel, has reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differ from the recorded grant dates of such awards. The independent committee's assessment of conduct relating to the Company's historical stock option practices has been substantially completed. The independent committee found that there was no intentional misconduct by management. On December 18, 2007, upon the recommendation of management and the independent committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the Company's financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to restate certain of its previously-issued financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expenses relating to past stock option grants. The significant majority of the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. The Company has not determined the final amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which specific periods require restatement. The Company's management and the independent committee have discussed this matter with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will not be in a position to file the delayed 2007 Form 10-K, September Form 10-Q, or December Form 10-Q until after the completion of the review and until the Company can determine the amount of the non-cash adjustments to compensation expense related to prior stock option grants. Because the Company does not believe it can complete that work by February 13, 2008, the Company has requested that the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council call for review the Panel's January 15, 2008 decision as explained above.
On February 7, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing receipt of the NASDAQ notice. The press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

On February 8, 2008, Lam Research Corporation received a letter from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council (the "Listing Council") advising that the Listing Council has called for review the January 15, 2008 decision of the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") and that the Listing Council has determined to stay the Panel's decision to suspend Lam's securities from trading pending further action by the Listing Council.
The Listing Council has given Lam until March 28, 2008 to make any submissions that Lam would like to be incorporated into the written record to be considered by the Listing Council. While the Company continues to work diligently to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements, there can be no assurance that the Company will become compliant with NASDAQ requirements before the Listing Council takes any action lifting the stay.
As previously announced, Lam received letters from NASDAQ on August 27, 2007, November 7, 2007 and February 5, 2008 advising Lam that it is not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). These letters, which the Company had expected, were issued in accordance with standard NASDAQ procedures due to the delayed filing of Lam's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 23, 2007 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 23, 2007, respectively.
On October 11, 2007, Lam Research attended a hearing before the Panel at which Lam's management presented its plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's filing requirements. Following the hearing, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing, subject to certain requirements. As amended, the Panel's decision required, among other things, that the Company file with the Securities and Exchange Commission the delayed reports by February 13, 2008. This deadline has been stayed by the Listing Council's decision.

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

Guarantor agrees that until the Guaranteed Obligations has been paid in full and any commitments of Agent or facilities provided by Agent with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated, Guarantor shall not be released by or because of the taking, or failure to take, any action that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of Guarantor under this Guaranty or that, but for this section, might discharge or otherwise reduce, limit, or modify Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty. Guarantor waives and surrenders any defense to any liability under this Guaranty based upon any such action, including but not limited to any action of Agent described in the immediately preceding section of this Guaranty.

Guaranty to be Absolute
     6. . Guarantor waives:
Guarantor's Waivers of Certain Rights and Certain Defenses

     (b) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Borrower or a Guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Borrower or a Guarantor;
     (c) any defense based on any claim that Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of Borrower; and
     (d) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting Guarantor's liability hereunder.
No provision or waiver in this Guaranty shall be construed as limiting the generality of any other waiver contained in this Guaranty.
     7. . Until the Guaranteed Obligations has been paid in full and any commitments of Agent or facilities provided by Agent with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated, even though the Guaranteed Obligations may be in excess of Guarantor's liability hereunder, Guarantor waives to the extent permitted by applicable law any right of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution (contractual, statutory, or otherwise) including, without limitation, any claim or right of subrogation under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any successor statute, arising from the existence or performance of this Guaranty, and Guarantor waives to the extent permitted by applicable law any right to enforce any remedy that Agent now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, and waives any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security now or hereafter held by Agent.

3
 
property collateral pledged by Borrower: (1) the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) Agent may collect from Guarantor even if Agent, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower. This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Guarantor may have because any of the Guaranteed Obligations is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
     (c) Guarantor waives any right or defense it may have at law or equity, including California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a, to a fair market value hearing or action to determine a deficiency judgment after a foreclosure.
     10. . Any obligations of Borrower to Guarantor, now or hereafter existing, including but not limited to any obligations to Guarantor as subrogee of Agent or resulting from Guarantor's performance under this Guaranty, are hereby subordinated to the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition to Guarantor's waiver of any right of subrogation as set forth in this Guaranty with respect to any obligations of Borrower to Guarantor as subrogee of Agent, Guarantor agrees that, if Agent so requests, following and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Guarantor shall not demand, take, or receive from Borrower, by setoff or in any other manner, payment of any other obligations of Borrower to Guarantor until the Guaranteed Obligations has been paid in full and any commitments of Agent or facilities provided by Agent with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations have been terminated. If any payments are received by Guarantor in violation of such waiver or agreement, such payments shall be received by Guarantor as trustee for Agent and shall be paid over to Agent on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. Any security interest, lien, or other encumbrance that Guarantor may now or hereafter have on any property of Borrower is hereby subordinated to any security interest, lien, or other encumbrance that Agent may have on any such property.
Subordination
     11. . If this Guaranty is revoked, returned, or canceled, and subsequently any payment or transfer of any interest in property by Borrower to Agent is rescinded or must be returned by Agent to Borrower, this Guaranty shall be reinstated with respect to any such payment or transfer, regardless of any such prior revocation, return, or cancellation.
Reinstatement of Guaranty
     12. .

     14. . Where Borrower is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company, it is not necessary for Agent to inquire into the powers of Borrower or of the officers, directors, partners, members, managers, or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder, subject to any limitations on Guarantor's liability set forth herein.

Event of Default
     (i) Any Event of Default occurs under the Credit Agreement.

     (iii) Any involuntary lien of any kind or character attaches to any of the Collateral.
     (b) If an Event of Default occurs, Pledgee may do any one or more of the following:
     (i) Declare any Secured Obligations immediately due and payable, without notice or demand.
     (ii) Exercise as to any or all of the Collateral all the rights, powers and remedies of an owner, subject to the Section 7 hereof.
     (iii) Enforce the security interest given hereunder pursuant to the UCC and any other applicable law.
     (iv) Sell all or any part of the Collateral at public or private sale in accordance with the UCC, without advertisement, in such manner and order as Pledgee may elect. Pledgee may purchase the Collateral for its own account at any such sale. Pledgee shall give Pledgor such notice of any public or private sale as may be required by the UCC, provided that to the extent notice of any such sale is required by the UCC or other applicable law, Pledgor agrees that at least 10 days notice to Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification and provided further that, if Pledgee fails to comply with this sentence in any respect, its liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any) imposed on it as a matter of law under the UCC or other applicable law. Pledgor acknowledges that Collateral may be sold at a loss to Pledgor, and that, in such event, Pledgee shall have no liability or responsibility to Pledgor for such loss. Pledgor further acknowledges that a private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such
 
circumstances, agrees that no such private sale shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed not to be "commercially reasonable" solely as a result of such prices and other sale terms. Upon any such sale, Pledgee shall have the right to deliver, assign and transfer to the buyer thereof the Collateral so sold. Each buyer at any such sale shall hold the Collateral so sold absolutely and free from any claim or right of whatsoever kind, including any equity or right of redemption of Pledgor that may be waived or any other right or claim of Pledgor, and Pledgor, to the extent permitted by law, hereby specifically waives all rights of redemption, stay or appraisal that Pledgor has or may have under any law now existing or hereafter adopted.
Without limiting any other rights and remedies available to Pledgee, Pledgor expressly acknowledges and agrees that with respect to Collateral consisting of notes, bonds or other securities which are not sold on a recognized market, Pledgee shall be deemed to have conducted a commercially reasonable sale of such Collateral if (a) such sale is conducted by any nationally recognized broker-dealer (including any affiliate of Pledgee), investment banker or any other method common in the securities industry, and (b) if the purchaser is Pledgee or any affiliate of Pledgee, the sale price received by Pledgee in connection with such sale is reasonably supported by quotations received from one or more other nationally recognized broker-dealers, investment bankers or other financial institutions.
     (v) Enforce the security interest of Pledgee in any deposit account which is part of the Collateral by applying such account to the Secured Obligations.
     (vi) Exercise any other remedy provided under this Agreement or by any applicable law.

     (viii) Sell the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral. Pledgee may specifically disclaim any warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered to affect adversely the commercial reasonableness of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral.
All cash proceeds received by or on behalf of Pledgee in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral may, following the payment of the fees and expenses of Pledgee, be held by Pledgee as collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter applied in whole or in part by Pledgee to, the Secured Obligations in such order as Pledgee may elect. Any surplus of such cash or cash proceeds held by or on behalf of Pledgee and remaining after payment in full of all the Secured Obligations shall be paid to Pledgor. If the proceeds of sale, collection or other realization of or upon the Collateral pursuant to this Section are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses of such realization and the payment in full of all Secured Obligations, Pledgor shall remain liable for any deficiency to the extent Pledgor are
 
obligated therefor under the other documents executed in connection with the Secured Obligations and this Agreement.
     9. . If Pledgor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, Pledgee may perform or cause performance of such agreement and the expenses of Pledgee incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Pledgor under Section 13. Any powers conferred on Pledgee hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for reasonable care in the custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by it hereunder, Pledgee shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any Collateral. Pledgee shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which Pledgee accords its own property, it being understood that Pledgee shall not have any responsibility for (a) ascertaining, exercising or taking other action or giving Pledgor notice with respect to subscription rights, calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, lenders or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not Pledgee has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (b) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any Collateral. Pledgee shall not be liable for any loss to the Collateral resulting from acts of God, war, civil commotion, fire, earthquake, or other disaster or for any other loss or damage to the Collateral except to the extent such loss is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from Pledgee's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
RIGHT TO CURE; LIMITATION ON PLEDGEE'S DUTIES
     10. . Pledgee shall be under no duty or obligation whatsoever and Pledgor waives any right to require Pledgee to (i) make or give any presentment, demands for performances, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest or notices of dishonor in connection with any obligations or evidences of indebtedness held by Pledgee as Collateral, or in connection with any obligation or evidences of indebtedness which constitute in whole or in part the Secured Obligations, (ii) proceed against any person or entity, (iii) proceed against or exhaust any collateral, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in Pledgee's power; and Pledgor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of Pledgor or any other person, or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of Pledgor or any other person. Until the Secured Obligations is paid in full, Pledgor waives any right of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution (contractual, statutory or otherwise), including without limitation any claim or right of subrogation under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the U.S. Code) or any successor statute, arising from the existence or performance of this Agreement, and Pledgor waives any right to enforce any remedy which Pledgee now has or may hereafter have against Pledgor or against any other person and waives any benefit of and any right to participate in any Collateral or security whatsoever now or hereafter held by Pledgee.

instruments of transfer or assignment in blank in form and substance satisfactory to Pledgee, and (ii) following and during the continuance of an Event of Default, in the same form as received (with any necessary endorsement), all dividends and other distributions paid or payable in cash in respect of any Collateral and any such amounts, if received by Pledgor, shall be received in trust for the benefit of Pledgee and be segregated from the other property or funds of Pledgor.
     (b) Pledgee may at any time deliver the Collateral or any part thereof to Pledgor and the receipt by Pledgor shall be a complete and full acquittance for the Collateral so delivered, and Pledgee shall thereafter be discharged from any liability or responsibility therefor.
     (c) Upon the transfer of all or any part of the Secured Obligations, Pledgee may transfer all or any part of the Collateral and shall be fully discharged thereafter from all liability and responsibility with respect to such Collateral so transferred, and the transferee shall be vested with all the rights and powers of Pledgee hereunder with respect to such Collateral so transferred; but with respect to any Collateral not so transferred Pledgee shall retain all rights and powers hereby given. Pledgor agrees that Pledgee may disclose to any prospective purchaser or transferee and any purchaser or transferee of all or part of the Secured Obligations any and all information in Pledgee's possession concerning Pledgor, this Agreement and the Collateral.

     (b) Until all Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full and Pledgee shall have no obligation to extend credit to Pledgor, the power of sale and all other rights, powers and remedies granted to Pledgee hereunder shall continue to exist and may be exercised by Pledgee at the time specified hereunder irrespective of the fact that the Secured Obligations or any part thereof may have become barred by any statute of limitations, or that the personal liability of Pledgor may have ceased. Pledgor waives the benefit of any statute of limitations as applied to this Agreement.
     13. . All advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred or paid by Pledgee in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or in the enforcement thereof, and including the charges and expenses of Pledgee's custody unit, shall become a part of the Secured Obligations secured hereunder and shall be paid to Pledgee by Pledgor immediately and without demand, with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the highest rate of interest of any Secured Obligations secured by this Agreement (or, if there is no such interest rate, at the maximum interest rate permitted by law for interest on judgments). Such costs and attorneys' fees shall include the allocated cost of in-house counsel to the extent permitted by law.

2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
On March 11, 2008, Lam Research Corporation ("Lam Research") completed its previously announced acquisition of SEZ Holding AG ("SEZ"), the leading supplier of single-wafer clean technology and products to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. The acquisition was effected upon the completion of a tender offer for the outstanding shares of SEZ as well as the satisfaction of other conditions to closing. Upon the completion of the tender, Lam Research acquired approximately 95% of the outstanding shares of SEZ. Lam Research expects to take additional steps as necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding.
The tender offer was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered into on December 10, 2007 by and between Lam Research and SEZ (the "Transaction Agreement"). Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Lam Research acquired all shares of SEZ that were tendered in the offer at a price of CHF 38 per share in cash, for a total price of CHF 606 million, which approximates US$584 million at the current exchange rate. Net of cash acquired, the purchase price approximates US$457 million.
The foregoing description of the Transaction Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement which was filed as Exhibit 10.110 to Lam Research's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 14, 2007.

Adoption of Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goals for Calendar Year 2008
     On March 14, 2008, based upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), the independent members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") established performance goals under Lam's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan for calendar year 2008 for Stephen G. Newberry, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The performance goals included financial, operating and marketing objectives. Financial goals included revenue, gross margin, cash generation and operating profit targets. Non-financial targets included certain market position objectives. Mr. Newberry's 2008 annual incentive target is set at 125% of base salary. Actual incentive awards may range from zero to 2.25 times the target amount based on both corporate and individual performance factors. To the extent that the actual performance (whether corporate or individual) falls below predetermined performance targets, incentive awards are determined as a declining percentage of the target incentive amount. No incentive awards are paid under the incentive plan if predetermined minimum financial performance targets are not met.
Adoption of Multi-Year Cash Incentive Program Performance Goals
     On March 14, 2008, based on the recommendations of the Committee, the Board established performance goals and award amounts for 2008, the second calendar year of the Company's 2007/2008 Multi-Year Incentive Program ("2007 MYIP") and the first calendar year of its 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Program ("2008 MYIP") for Mr. Newberry.
     The 2007 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2007 and 2008, and awards will vest and be payable in 2009. The 2008 MYIP is based on company performance during calendar years 2008 and 2009, and awards will vest and be payable in 2010.
     The Multi-Year Incentive Programs accrue a certain percentage of the Company's ongoing operating income, which is calculated by dividing the accumulated individual target amounts by a baseline operating income figure and multiplying that result by the Company's actual ongoing operating income for each quarter. Actual Program accruals may be enhanced based upon a stock price performance factor. Actual award accruals may vary from zero to a maximum of 2.5 times the target amount depending upon the operating income and stock performance metrics, as applicable. The Board and Committee retain discretion to reduce amounts that would otherwise be accrued under the Programs.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

409A Liability
     As disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007, filed on March 31, 2008, a special committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Independent Committee") concluded its voluntary review into the historical stock option granting process followed by the Company. As a result of that review and conclusions reached by the Company, on March 30, 2008 the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board") authorized the Company (i) to satisfy the potential Internal Revenue Code Section 409A liability to current and past employees arising as a result of their exercise of misdated stock options, which vested after December 31, 2004, in 2006 or 2007 ("misdated options") and, as applicable, similar state tax laws, inclusive of applicable penalties and interest (collectively, the "409A Liability"), and (ii) if necessary, to compensate such employees for the additional tax liability associated with the Company's assumption of the 409A Liability ("gross-up payment").
     The Board currently expects that the cash cost to the Company to satisfy all 409A Liabilities, inclusive of the gross-up payments, will be in the range of $50 million to $55 million.
     The table below lists the estimated cost to the Company to satisfy the 409A Liabilities and the gross-up payments for our executive officers who exercised misdated options. It also presents the additional financial statement compensation expense incurred by the Company for those misdated options; i.e. the difference between the exercise price assumed on the date of the original grant and the closing price of our common stock on the new measurement date determined by the Independent Committee and the Company. Unlike the financial statement compensation expense, the estimated 409A Liability is calculated on the entire amount of income recognized by the executive as a result of the exercise of the misdated options, not just on the difference between the exercise price assumed on the date of the original grant and the closing price of our common stock on the new measurement date determined by the Independent Committee and the Company.
     The 409A Liability inclusive of the gross-up payment for Mr. Newberry relates to his new-hire option grant of August 12, 1997, a portion of which vested after December 31, 2004. Mr. Newberry's new-hire option grant provided him with the right to purchase 900,000 shares of the Company's common stock, calculated on a post-stock-split basis, at $18.48 per share. The Independent Committee and Company determined that the proper measurement date for financial accounting purposes related to Mr. Newberry's new hire option grant was August 29, 1997. The closing price of the Company's common stock on August 29, 1997, was $18.83 per share. Since the aggregate exercise price of Mr. Newberry's new hire option is less than the exercise price that would have been used if the Company had established the exercise price based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the financial accounting measurement date by $312,415, a portion of Mr. Newberry's new hire option grant is a misdated option.
     The 409A Liability inclusive of the gross-up payment for each of Messrs. Gottscho, Hariri and Bondur relate to misdated options issued in connection with the 2002 annual grant to executives that occurred on February 27, 2002, as part of the Company's customary executive compensation practices, and in the case of Messrs. Hariri and Gottscho, a portion of the 409A Liability relates to a misdated stock option made pursuant to the Company's Executive Pay Reduction Program.

     As disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007, filed on March 31, 2008, a special committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Independent Committee") concluded its voluntary internal review into the historical stock option granting process followed by the Company. As a result of that review and conclusions reached by the Company, on April 3, 2008, the Company filed a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The purpose of the tender offer is to amend certain misdated stock options, which vested after December 31, 2004 ("misdated options") that had an exercise price which was less than the closing price of the Company's common stock on the appropriate measurement date determined by the Independent Committee and the Company for financial accounting purposes. Employees eligible to participate in the tender offer will have the opportunity to increase the exercise price of these misdated options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the correct measurement date so as to avoid adverse tax consequences under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and, as applicable, similar provisions of state law. In exchange for increasing the exercise price of these misdated options, the Company will agree to make a cash payment to employees participating in the tender offer in order to make employees whole for the incremental exercise price increase. The Company expects to amend up to 741,168 misdated options and to make aggregate cash compensation payments of $2,409,023 in January of 2009 pursuant to the tender offer.
     Although current Section 16 officers are generally not eligible to participate in the tender offer, Ernest E. Maddock, Abdi Hariri, Thomas J. Bondur and Martin B. Anstice are eligible to participate because they were not Section 16 officers on the dates the misdated options were granted to them. The Company expects to make cash payments and to amend misdated options to each of Messrs. Maddock, Hariri, Bondur and Anstice as illustrated in the table below:

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended March 30, 2008
FREMONT, Calif., April 23, 2008 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2008 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended March 30, 2008. Revenue for the period was $613.8 million, gross margin was $287.2 million and net income was $103.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $610.3 million, gross margin of $307.7 million and net income of $115.1 million, or $0.91 per diluted share for the December 2007 quarter.
The earnings of the SEZ Group, after the March 11, 2008 acquisition date, have been consolidated into the March 2008 quarter results. The Company has decided to adopt an acceptance-based revenue recognition model for the SEZ Group, now known as the Spin Clean Division, which has the effect of deferring almost all of the post-acquisition March quarter Spin Clean Division revenues and the related cost of sales to a future period. Accordingly, Spin Clean Division revenues were limited to $1.7 million, and after operating expenses and an in-process research and development write-off related to the acquisition, the resulting U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") loss was $5.6 million after taxes.
The Company's ongoing results for the March 2008 quarter exclude certain costs related to the recent acquisition of the SEZ Group, including the foreign currency gains associated with the acquisition and the one-time charge for in-process research and development expense. In addition, the Company's ongoing results for the March 2008 and December 2007 quarters exclude the costs associated with its voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating income, ongoing net income, and ongoing diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $109.8 million, or $0.87 per diluted share in the March 2008 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $118.9 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, for the December 2007 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2008 quarter slightly exceeded the Company's expectations and was $293.6 million or 47.8% compared to ongoing gross margin of $307.7 million, or 50.4%, for the December 2007 quarter. The majority of the sequential decline was due to unfavorable customer and product mix. Ongoing operating expenses of $148.9 million for the March 2008 quarter were higher than the December 2007 quarter of $140.0 million, primarily due to the inclusion of the Spin Clean Division operating expenses and to a lesser extent higher employee compensation costs at the Company.
 
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2008 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.0 billion at the end of the March 2008 quarter, including approximately $0.2 billion attributed to the Spin Clean Division. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances were $270.1 million and $162.1 million, respectively. At the end of the March 2008 period, the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that is not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $43 million.
"Lam's March quarter performance met or slightly exceeded our expectations for shipments, revenues, gross margins and operating income. The headwind of the current economic environment creates challenges for us and many other semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the upcoming quarters, but we believe that our intense focus on creating yield enabling solutions in etch and clean coupled with our investment in long-term new market opportunities, has Lam Research well positioned to resume a strong growth trajectory when our customers recommence increased wafer fabrication equipment spending," said Steve Newberry, Lam Research's president and chief executive officer.
"Our acquisition of the SEZ Group is a significant milestone on our path to become a multi-market, $4+ billion dollar revenue company targeted for calendar year 2010. I am encouraged by the enthusiasm of the Clean Group employees in their initial collaboration efforts, particularly at the customer interface, where we now offer the broadest set of single-wafer wet clean solutions. Our partnership in R&D, where the sharing of process and hardware knowledge offers exciting opportunities, is already extremely active. Taken together, these elements reinforce our belief in the strategic merit of the acquisition. I want to convey appreciation to all employees for their continued hard work in facilitating the next leg of growth for Lam Research," Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the challenges we will face in the current economic environment, our focus on creating yield enabling solutions for our customers, our continued commitment to investing in long-term opportunities, the value of the acquisition of the SEZ Group, our progress toward a multi-market, $4+ billion revenue company, the opportunities presented by the acquisition of SEZ, our belief in the strategic value of the SEZ acquisition, the Company's continuation on its growth trajectory, the resumption by customers of increased wafer fabrication equipment spending, the future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers, and our ability to successfully integrate the SEZ Spin Clean Division. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the technical challenges presented by our new products. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 23, 2007, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On May 1, 2008, the Company completed its previously announced tender offer for certain misdated employee stock options, which vested after December 31, 2004 ("misdated options"). The misdated options had an exercise price which was less than the closing price of the Company's common stock on the appropriate measurement date determined by a special committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Company for financial accounting purposes. In connection with the completion of the tender offer, the Company has agreed to amend these misdated options to increase the exercise price to the appropriate fair market value per share on the correct measurement date so as to avoid adverse tax consequences under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A ("Section 409A") and, as applicable, similar provisions of state law. In exchange for increasing the exercise price of these misdated options, the Company has agreed to make a cash payment in January of 2009 to employees participating in the tender offer in order to make such employees whole for the incremental exercise price increase. No executive officers of the Company participated in the tender offer.
     The Company has also entered into a Stock Option Amendment and Special Bonus Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.143 with each of four executive officers who were not eligible to participate in the tender offer, to amend certain misdated options held by such executive officers. The four executive officers who entered into the stock option amendment agreements were not officers of the Company on the date that the misdated options were granted to them. As a result of the amendments, the exercise price of the misdated options has been increased to the appropriate fair market value per share on the correct measurement date so as to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A and, as applicable, similar provisions of state law. In exchange for increasing the exercise price of these misdated options, the Company agreed to make a cash payment in January of 2009 to these executive officers, except for Martin B. Anstice, in order to make such executive officers whole for the incremental exercise price increase. The stock option amendment agreement applicable to Mr. Anstice amends his misdated options without a cash payment in January 2009.
     The Company expects to make cash payments to each of Thomas J. Bondur, Abdi Hariri, and Ernest E. Maddock and to amend misdated options to each of Messrs. Anstice, Bondur, Hariri, and Maddock, as illustrated in the table below:

Exhibit 23.1
The Board of Directors SEZ Holding AG:
We consent to the incorporation by reference in the registration statements (Nos. 333-138545, 333-84638, 333-74500, 333-93115, 333-72751, 333-66833, 333-01011, 333-32981 and 333-127936) on Form S-8 of Lam Research Corporation of our report dated May 27, 2008, with respect to the consolidated balance sheet of SEZ Holding AG and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity, consolidated statement of recognized income and expense, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, which report appears in the Form 8-K/A of Lam Research Corporation dated March 11, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the acquisition of SEZ Holding AG ("SEZ") by Lam Research Corporation (the "Company"). Lam Research follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar and its fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of June each year whereas SEZ has a December 31 fiscal year end. In order to prepare the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended June 24, 2007, SEZ's operating results were first conformed to Lam's year end. This was done utilizing SEZ's historical audited consolidated financial statement as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 included below in Exhibit 99.2 and the unaudited interim periods contained therein as well as SEZ's historical financial information for the six months ended December 31, 2006. This pro forma information is also based upon the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007 and upon the historical condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 23, 2007. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should accordingly be read in conjunction with the above-mentioned historical financial statements.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations present the combined operating results of the Company and SEZ for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2007 and the six months ended December 23, 2007, after giving effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred on June 26, 2006 and after taking into account the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.
A pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has not been presented because the acquisition has already been reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of Lam Research Corporation as of March 30, 2008 which has been filed on May 9, 2008 with the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 30, 2008. The results of SEZ's operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company after the March 11, 2008 acquisition date.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for informational purposes only. The pro forma information do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have been reported if the acquisition had been in effect for the periods presented or which may result in the future.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.2
SEZ Holding AG and Subsidiaries
 
The Board of Directors SEZ Holding AG:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of SEZ Holding AG and subsidiaries ("the Company") as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity, consolidated statement of recognized income and expense, and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management and the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
IAS 1 requires that financial statements be presented with comparative financial information. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared solely for the purpose of meeting the requirements of Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly no comparative financial information is presented.
In our opinion, except for the omission of comparative financial information as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SEZ Holding AG and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2007
Accounting principles
Introduction
SEZ Holding AG is a Swiss corporation, domiciled at Leutschenbachstrasse 98 in Zurich. It is the holding company of SEZ Group, a global leading supplier of process equipment for microchip production. The SEZ Group operates, outside of Switzerland, primarily in the European Union countries, in North America and Asia and had 883 employees at the balance sheet date.
Basic principles
The consolidated financial statements of SEZ Holding AG have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The accounting principles are applied uniformly. The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors on May 27, 2008.
All standards of IASB and interpretations of International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that have been effective at the time of the preparation of consolidated financial statements have been applied, except for IAS 1. IAS 1 requires that financial statements be presented with comparative financial information. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared solely for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, no comparative information is presented. The presentation currency of the Group is the Swiss Franc (CHF). Except for per share data, and unless otherwise indicated, the financial statements are presented in CHF 1000. Assets have been determined on the historical cost basis, with the exception of derivative financial instruments and financial assets that are classified as available for sale or held for trading; these are recorded at fair value.
Assumptions and management judgments
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates affect the current period or also future periods, depending on the issue. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Additionally, the application of the Group's accounting policies may require management to make judgments that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Management judgment is particularly required when assessing the substance of transactions that have a complex structure or legal form. The most significant estimates, assumptions and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are described below.
 
The reported assets are reviewed annually for impairment. To assess if impairment exists, estimates are made of the expected future cash flows from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual cash flows can vary from these estimates. Different factors such as changes in use, reorganizations, technical reasons etc. could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets (note 13):
Deferred tax assets relating to the carry-forward of tax losses are recognized on an entity level to the extent that they can probably be offset or are set off against positive valuation differences. The estimation of the ability to offset is based on historical experience and the available and approved budgets. The effective ability to offset carry-forwarded tax losses in future periods depends strongly on the economic environment. Therefore, the ability to offset can be judged differently in following periods which could significantly affect the reported deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax assets (note 12):
Warranty provisions cover guarantee risks related to defective products. The calculation of these provisions is based on past experience. The calculation is reviewed annually for adequacy and is set per sold piece of equipment.
Warranty provisions (note 23):
Changes in accounting principles
Effective from 1 January 2007, SEZ implemented the following revised and new standards that have been published by IASB (International Accounting Standards Board):
IFRS 7 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" and Amendment to IAS 1 "Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures" were applied for the first time. Furthermore, as of 1 January 2007 IFRIC 7 "Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies", IFRIC 8 "Scope of IFRS 2  Share-based payment", IFRIC 9 "Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives" as well as IFRIC 10 " Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment " were also applied for the first time.
The new and revised standards and interpretations did not have any impact on the primary statements. The application of IFRS 7 and IAS 1 has resulted in additional disclosures on financial instruments and equity.
The other accounting policies have been applied unchanged.
 
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been issued by IASB until the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements by the board of directors. These are however not yet effective and are not applied early in these consolidated financial statements. The impact on the consolidated financial statements of SEZ has not yet been systematically evaluated. The expected impact, as disclosed below, only reflects a first assessment by Group management.
 
 
Valuation and accounting principles
Scope and principles of consolidation
Scope of consolidation
Information regarding the scope of consolidation is listed under note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of SEZ Holding AG as well as its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is a Group company which SEZ Holding AG controls by holding (either directly or indirectly) more than 50% of the voting rights of the company. Under the full consolidation method all assets and liabilities as well as expenses and earnings of the Group companies are included effective from the date of takeover of control. Intercompany receivables and liabilities as well as Group internal expenses, income and cash flows are eliminated. Intercompany profits from deliveries between consolidated companies which are included in the inventories as of year-end, are eliminated.
Purchase method and accounting for goodwill
The capital consolidation is accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The excess of the purchase price over the Group's proportion of the fair value of the net assets (equity) of the purchased company is recorded as goodwill. According to IFRS 3 "Business Combinations", goodwill from acquisitions is not systematically amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment, or, when indicators for a potential impairment exist, earlier.
Equity method
Investments in associates where SEZ Holding AG holds, either directly or indirectly, 20 to 50 % of the voting rights are accounted for using the equity method and recorded as investments in associates. Under this method, the investment is initially recorded at cost, and is increased or decreased by the proportionate share of the associate's profits or losses after the date of acquisition as well as by impairments. Dividends paid during the year reduce the carrying value of such investments.
 
Foreign currency transactions and translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the spot rate at the date of transaction. Gains or losses arising on settlement of these transactions are recognized in the income statement. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective subsidiary's functional currency are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Any resulting gains or losses are recognized in the income statement. In accordance with the net investment approach in IAS 21, foreign currency gains and losses arising from non-current intragroup loans from SEZ Holding AG to group companies are recognized in equity, net of the related tax effect.
Balance sheets of Group companies prepared in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss Francs at the year-end rate (the current rate method). Income and cash flow statements of Group companies are translated at average exchange rates of the year. Differences resulting from the translation of the individual balance sheets and income statements are recorded in consolidated shareholders' equity (translation reserve) without affecting the income statement.
Significant accounting and reporting policies
Historical cost concept
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, where positions are measured at purchase cost/ manufacturing cost or lower market value respectively. Financial assets classified as available for sale or held for trading purposes are recorded at fair value.
Balance sheet positions
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Proportionate production overheads are capitalized; however interest expense is not capitalized in the valuation of fixed assets manufactured by the Group. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and their respective depreciation periods are:
 
Leasing property
Long-term leasing agreements, which effectively constitute assets purchased with long-term financing, are recorded as fixed assets at their purchase price and amortized over the lease term. The corresponding lease liabilities are included in long-term and short-term debt, according to their maturities. The initial lease term for buildings is approximately 15 years.
Investments in associates
Investments in associates include investments in entities accounted for using the equity method. These are mainly entities, over which SEZ Group holds 20% to 50% of the voting rights but does not exercise control.
Other financial investments
Other financial investments consist of minority interests with voting rights below 20% and other financial assets. The other financial assets are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date. Unrealized changes in fair value are recorded within equity and transferred to financial income / expenses when the available-for-sale financial assets are sold or impaired.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist mainly of purchased computer software and licenses, purchased patents as well as goodwill. Software, licenses and patents are accounted for at historical cost less accumulated amortization, calculated on a straight-line basis, and impairments. Software is amortized over the estimated useful life of 3 to 5 years and licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over 4 to 10 years. Internally generated intangible assets, especially patents, are only capitalized in case criteria according to IAS 38 are fulfilled. Purchased patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum 17 years). Until December 31, 2004, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life (maximum 17 years). Since January 1, 2005, goodwill is not systematically amortized anymore. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Inventories and work in progress
Inventories include finished goods, work in progress and demonstration tools that are designated for sale. They are reported at the lower of cost (purchase price or production cost) and market value (net realizable value). The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method. Production costs include material cost, production department costs and proportionate factory overheads. Inventories with long turnover periods, as well as obsolete goods, are written down. Unrealized intercompany profits on inventories are eliminated from the income statement in consolidation. Demonstration tools, which are not designated for sale, are included in non-current assets.
 
Receivables
Receivables are disclosed at nominal values less individually calculated bad debt allowances to arrive at their recoverable amounts.
The bad debt allowances consist of a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, for which objective evidence exists, that the Group will not be able to collect them, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
When sufficient objective evidence exists, that a receivable is uncollectible, the receivable and the corresponding allowance for this receivable are derecognized.
Financial investments
Financial investments include marketable, readily realizable assets to be held for trading purposes. Purchases and sales are recorded as of the closing date, not as of the delivery date. These securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank accounts and fixed-term deposits with original maturities of up to 90 days.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when it is expected, that their carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use. The asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable in order to be classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.
 
Impairment of assets
Consideration is given at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment of the carrying amounts of the Group's assets. If any indicators exist, an asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Impairment is recognized whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the net selling price and the value in use. In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value based on the average borrowing rate of the country where the assets are located, adjusted for risks specific to the asset.
Treasury shares
Treasury shares are deducted from consolidated shareholders' equity at cost. Gains or losses arising from treasury share transactions are recorded directly in shareholders' equity without impacting the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are established for present obligations arising from past events, where the settlement thereof is expected to result in an outflow of economic benefits and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Liabilities
Non-current liabilities include those liabilities which are due and payable after one year from the balance sheet date. Current liabilities include those liabilities which are due and payable within one year from the balance sheet date. This also includes the short-term portion of long-term debt. All interest-bearing liabilities are recorded under debt. Interest bearing liabilities are recorded at cost (less transaction costs) using the effective interest rate method, where differences between cost and repayment value are amortized over the duration through the income statement.
Income statement positions
Revenue and income recognition
Sales from trading activities are recognized when all material benefits, risks and title restrictions have been transferred to the purchaser and there is no doubt regarding related revenues and costs. Expected costs related to the installation of goods, which have been factory tested and where revenue has been recognized, are accrued. Sales from services are recognized when the related work has been performed. Interest, dividends and other financial income are recognized in the income statement as earned.
 
Current income taxes and deferred taxes
Current income taxes are calculated on taxable profit. Deferred taxes are calculated using the "Balance Sheet Liability Method". Deferred taxes are recognized on taxable and deductible temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxes on loss carry forwards and valuation differences are capitalized to the extent that their realization through future taxable gains is probable. Deferred taxes are calculated using local tax rates. No provisions for deferred taxes have been recorded for undistributed retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries if such retained earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. Provisions for withholding taxes on planned dividend payments are accrued for if they are not recoverable.
Equity compensation plans  stock options
Through different equity compensation plans SEZ offers options to purchase SEZ Holding AG shares to members of the board of directors, the management board and key employees. Options granted prior to November 2002 are not in the scope of the recognition principles of IFRS 2. The exercise of these options is therefore recognized directly in equity. Generally IFRS 2 requires that the fair value of share-based compensation is determined and charged to net income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The fair value is recognized within personnel expenses and credited to equity (equity settlement). From time to time the company purchases own shares to cover the risk related to the issued options. The costs of these treasury shares are deducted from equity. Furthermore, there is conditional capital reserved for the Group's employee stock option plan. Legal dues in connection with the exercise of options are recorded in the income statement at exercise date.
Employee benefits
Employees of the Group's Austrian subsidiary are entitled to certain one-time benefits upon termination. These benefits are calculated based on the individual employee's years of service and their salary level. Provisions for termination benefits are based on actuarial calculations and cover the Group's expected termination benefit obligations. The employees of the Group's Austrian subsidiary are also entitled to certain anniversary benefits depending on their years of employment. Appropriate provisions that have been recorded for these liabilities are based on actuarial calculations. The calculation of these defined benefit liabilities at the closing date and the corresponding expenses are based on the projected unit credit method. The expenses to establish the provision for termination benefits are charged to the income statement except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized directly in equity. Contributions to defined contribution plans are recorded in the income statement on an accrual basis.
 
Research and development costs
Research and development costs include wages and salaries, material costs, related overhead costs as well as depreciation and amortization of prototypes, demonstration tools and patents dedicated to research and development. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred as the IAS 38 conditions for capitalizing development costs have not been met.
Financial income, financial expenses
Interest income and interest expenses are recorded in the income statement, considering the effective interest rate method. Exchange profits and losses from transactions are recognized directly in the income statement in the period they occur.
Transfer prices
Intercompany sales are undertaken at arm's length.
Derivative financial instruments
The SEZ Group occasionally secures foreign currency risks using derivative financial instruments, which are recorded at fair value in other receivables and liabilities. Unrealized gains or losses from these contracts, which are marked to market, are recorded in the financial result. SEZ does not apply hedge accounting.
Subsidies
Subsidies received for investing activities are initially recorded as liability in the financial statements as of the date of receipt. Such amounts are recognized as other operating income of the respective functional area over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. Subsidies received for current expenses are also allocated to the functional area.

In the reporting year there were no changes in the scope of consolidation.
The following foreign exchange rates were used to translate positions in the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement:
In the reporting year no subsidiaries have been purchased.
Net sales comprise:
Other income comprises:
 
The following expenses by nature are presented in the income statement according to the cost of sales method.
Included in wages and salaries are bonus payments to employees and member of the management board amounting to CHF 10,011,000. Note 30 provides information on the expenses from the issue of SEZ shares that were charged to equity. Detailed information on employee benefit expenses is included in note 22.
Administration expenses include costs and fees in connection with the acquisition of SEZ Holding AG by Lam Research Corporation in the amount of CHF 9,820,000.
 
SEZ Group has various internally generated patents and technologies in connection with its main product, the Spin-Processor. The Group constantly improves existing know-how and develops new patents and technologies. Research and development expenses reported in the income statement are decreased by subsidies received for investing activities and government grants of CHF 8,442,000.
Deferred taxes are calculated on the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base using the "Balance Sheet Liability Method".
 
Reconciliation of tax expense:
The local applicable tax rates vary from 8 % to 41 %.
 
As of December 31, 2007, the Group had tax loss carry forwards amounting to CHF 92,283,000, including losses incurred during the current period. Included are tax loss carry forwards of SEZ Holding AG in the amount of CHF 35,045,000, of SEZ America Inc. in the amount of CHF 15,348,000 and tax loss carry forwards of SEZ Japan Inc. in the amount of CHF 17,959,000, for which no deferred tax assets are recognized.
Also included is the tax loss carry forward of SEZ Management GmbH amounting to CHF 11,491,000, consisting of the tax loss carry forwards of SEZ America Inc. and SEZ Japan Inc., which can be utilized against future taxable profit in Austria according to local tax law. Because of the high probability of the future taxable profits a deferred tax asset in connection with this tax loss carry forward of CHF 11,491,000 has been recognized.
Additionally a deferred tax asset has been recognized in 2007 that relates to previous years' losses of SEZ Holding AG, which relates to a change in the assessment of tax-free revenues.
In Austria the possibility to opt for group taxation has been introduced effective from the year 2005. Since 2005, SEZ Management GmbH, SEZ AG, SEZ America Inc. and SEZ Japan Inc. therefore form a tax group. In connection with this tax group, foreign losses can be offset against profits of the Austrian entity that is responsible for the group. In the reporting year, the positive tax effect from this group taxation was CHF 348 000, which is partly caused by the loss for the period of SEZ America Inc. amounting to CHF 1,392,000 that was offset against profits of SEZ Management GmbH.
In the current year the company made use of a tax free research grant in Austria amounting to CHF 3,892,000. In the income statement the research grant was deducted from the expenses for research and development.
 
Deferred taxes relate to the following consolidated balance sheet line items:
Tax loss carry forwards that were not capitalized as deferred tax assets have following maturities and potential tax effects as of the balance sheet date:
In connection with the group taxation in Austria, the use of losses of SEZ Japan Inc. and SEZ America Inc. that have occurred since the reporting year 2005 lead to a subsequent taxation of the asserted losses in the year of use. The tax rate for the subsequent taxation currently amounts to 25%. This results in a positive net effect for SEZ Group from the tax rate differences between Japan, USA and Austria.
Other non income related taxes of approximately CHF 1,404,000 are included in the income statement according to function.
 
 
 
The position patents in the amount of CHF 8,292,000 result from the acquisition of L-Tech Corporation, a company that has developed and patented the Aerosonic drying and BMG copper plating technology. The position includes in particular the following two technologies:
On the basis of these two technologies, SEZ is currently working on new product developments. Patents from the acquisition of L-Tech Corporation are amortized on a straight line basis over expected useful life of 17 years and are subject to an annual impairment test. The book value of the patents from the acquisition of L-Tech Corporation includes accumulated amortization for 6 years as of December 31, 2007.
As per balance sheet date goodwill with a carrying amount of CHF 4,195,000 relates to the acquisition of L-Tech Corporation. This goodwill is tested for impairment annually together with the Aerosonic drying and BMG copper plating technology. The calculation of the recoverable amount is based on the forecasted sales for the period from 2008 to 2015 by using the Relief from Royalty method. In applying this method, the savings that result from the patents acquired with the entity are calculated, which would otherwise be payable in form of license fees for using these technologies in SEZ products. The expected economic life of the asset exceeds the period used in the calculation of the recoverable amount.
The sales included in the calculation are based on a significantly increasing proportion of the Aerosonic drying technology in SEZ products. The implementation of the BMG copper plating technology in SEZ products is expected in the foreseeable future. A pre-tax discount rate of 18% for the semiconductor industry is used in this calculation. The results do not indicate any impairment of the patents and the goodwill acquired with L-Tech Corporation.
Apart from the L-Tech goodwill there is a goodwill position amounting to CHF 2,892,000 from the acquisition of SEZ Japan Inc. A value in use calculation was performed for the Japanese market based on forecasted cash flows for the period from 2008 to 2012, assuming a market growing each year. A pre-tax discount rate of 15.5% for the semiconductor industry is used in this calculation adjusted for Japanese debt financing conditions. The results do not indicate any impairment of the goodwill from the acquisition of SEZ Japan Inc.
Group management does not believe that any reasonably possible change in key assumptions could lead to the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amounts; extraordinary events excluded.
 
Additions in the reporting year relate to property, plant and equipment in the amount of CHF 20,180,000, financial assets in the amount of CHF 366,000 and intangible assets in the amount of CHF 1,659,000. The additions to property, plant and equipment include no additions based on finance lease contracts. The additions to fixed and intangible assets in the cash flow statement therefore amount to CHF 18,699,000. The difference in the amount of CHF 3,140,000 refers to finished prototypes that have been transferred from current assets into non-current assets due to internal use.
Depreciation and amortization expenses in the amount of CHF 30,406,000 include depreciation of property, plant and equipment amounting to CHF 29,149,000 and amortization of intangible assets amounting to CHF 1,256,000. In the current year an impairment for property, plant and equipment amounting to CHF 1,883,000 has been recognized due to the closure of the laboratory in Japan.
The transfer in current year consist of assets amounting to CHF 4,965,000 that have been reclassified to assets held for sale within current assets as well as machines amounting to CHF 1,997,000 that have been reclassified to current assets.
Other financial assets of CHF 2,714,000 include a 9 % minority interest in ICS Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan (CHF 936,000) and other financial assets of CHF 1,778,000.
The fair market value of ICS Technology Co. Ltd. is determined by approximation to historical cost, as there are no prospective financial figures that would allow a reliable determination of fair value. The costs of acquiring the investments represent the lower limit for a fair value calculation based on the available financial statements of ICS Technology Co. Ltd. at December 31, 2007.
 
As per 31 December 2007 no trade receivables have been pledged.
The movement in the allowance for individually impaired trade receivables was as follows:
The movement in the allowance for collectively impaired trade receivables was as follows:
The distribution of trade receivables by location of customers is as follows:
 
The aging of trade receivables at the reporting date was:
The financial investments in the amount of CHF 21,451,000 are held for trading purposes and include shares in investment funds, structured investment products and shares in listed companies. Financial instruments in the amount of CHF 17,856,000 are denominated in Euro, in the amount of CHF 2,226,000 in Swiss Franc and in the amount of CHF 1,369,000 in American Dollar and Japanese Yen. Financial investments of SEZ Holding AG in the amount of CHF 14,495,000 are pledged to secure long-term loans of SEZ AG, which amounted to CHF 24,836,000 on the balance sheet date.
 
Cash and cash equivalents are generally available to the SEZ Group. CHF 27,220,000 of the balance is pledged in favor of bank deposits of group companies, amounting to CHF 2,153,000 on the balance sheet date. Fixed term deposits comprise Euro and Swiss Francs and were invested in the reporting year at interest rates between 2.22 % and 4.53 %.
The capital reserves are subject to legal limitations on profit distributions of CHF 3,360,000. Treasury shares are deducted from equity at purchase price.
Consolidated retained earnings are subject to certain distribution limitations. A portion thereof are required to be distributed by Group companies to SEZ Holding AG before they become available for distribution by the General Meeting of SEZ Holding AG.
The currency translation differences are due to the foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the opening equity and the current profit of the Group's foreign entities.
In the reporting year outstanding shares were as follows:
 
The provisions for employee benefits consist of defined benefit obligations for settlements at termination of employment, anniversary bonuses and other defined contribution obligations.
Provisions for employee benefits are attributable to the following defined benefit and contribution plans:
 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation developed as follows:
Expense recognized in the income statement:
The expense is included in the following income statement positions:
Actuarial losses recognized directly in equity:
Principal actuarial assumptions:
 
Provisions for defined benefit plans fully cover actuarial liabilities. There are no plan assets to cover the expected future benefits obligations. Actuarial losses relate to profit based salary components and the change in the underlying discount rate.
In the reporting year 2007 there was no legal requirement for the separation of assets associated with employee benefit plans.
Expenses in connection with the defined contribution plans amounted to CHF 1,781,000.
Non-current debt
Thereof debt due after more than five years: CHF 13,810,000.
Current debt
 
Non-current debt due to banks includes CHF 27,733,000 denominated in Euro and CHF 383,000 denominated in Swiss Francs. The debt due to banks denominated in Euro is subject to the following conditions: from January 1, 2009 and July 2010 respectively it must be repaid in 6 half-year installments. The subsidized interest rate is 1% during the periods the loan is not amortized and 1.5% afterwards. The debt due to banks denominated in Swiss Francs is subject to the following conditions: it must be repaid in half-year installments by June 30, 2009 latest with an interest rate of 3.25% p.a.
The short-term debt due to banks is denominated in different currencies and is subject to conditions usual in the market. Regarding future investment activities the available funds have been mainly invested on a short-term basis. Financial income and expense therefore mainly depend on short-term interest rate fluctuations.
The carrying value of buildings held under finance leases is reflected in the schedule of movements in non-current assets. The breakdown of the future lease payments is as follows:
 
The lease agreements contain interest rate adjustments at the beginning of each interest period based on the 6 month EURIBOR plus a premium of 0.68 to 0.90 percentage points. This interest rate has been used for the calculation of the present value of minimum lease payments. For the next five years future minimum lease payments under operating lease arrangements amount to CHF 4,006,000, thereof CHF 1,964,000 are due in 2008. Total operating lease expenses incurred during the reporting year amount to CHF 2,675,000.
Current provisions developed as follows:
Warranty provisions cover guarantee risks from defective products.
 
Related parties include executive officers, members of the board of directors and significant shareholders as well as companies controlled by these parties.
Board of directors' remuneration includes a fixed payment and a performance-based payment. In the past a fixed number of SEZ Holding AG stock options have been granted. Additional cash payments are made for special engagements based on hours incurred.
The following total compensation accounted for on an accrual basis has been granted to members of the board of directors and management:
The following cash payments (salaries and profit sharing) were made to the members of the board of directors and management:
In the reporting year no stock options have been granted to the board of directors and management. Members of the board of directors and management hold the following stock options from prior business years:
 
Members of the board of directors of the Austrian subsidiaries receive a fixed payment in the total amount of CHF 49,000.
The law firm Meyer Lustenberger, in which Dr. Thomas Lustenberger, member of the board of directors of SEZ Holding AG, is one of several partners, charged CHF 197,000 for legal advisory services, especially in connection with the acquisition of SEZ Holding AG by Lam Research Corporation.
As of year-end, there were no receivables or payables due from or to related parties, respectively. During the reporting year there were no other significant transactions with related parties.
Issued stock options of 51,942 could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in the calculation of diluted loss per share because they are antidilutive for 2007.
 
The dilutive effect is based on stock options issued at balance sheet date and considers effects, which could arise from a potential exercise of options into shares of the Group. Refer to note 29 regarding the development of stock options issued.
In the reporting year treasury shares created out of conditional capital are included in the weighted average outstanding shares from the date of issue.
The conditional capital disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements of SEZ Holding AG does not have any dilutive effect as of December 31, 2007.
The recognition principles in IFRS 2 do not apply to the outstanding stock options granted in connection with compensation plans as they were granted prior to November 2002.
Stock options that have been granted to certain employees, members of the management board and board of directors were issued with the following terms:
 
The following expenses from the issue of SEZ shares have been debited to equity, as the existing share plans are exempted from recognition in the income statement due to the transitional requirements in IFRS 2.
The average share price at the time of the exercise of stock options in the reporting year was CHF 39.75.
Financial risks associated with existing assets and liabilities are reported to and monitored centrally by the SEZ Group. Derivative financial instruments are mainly used to economically hedge foreign currency exposure.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
Following sections provide an overview of the extent of individual risks as well as goals, principles and processes implemented for measurement, monitoring and hedging the financial risks as well as on capital management of the Group. Further information on financial risks is included in remaining notes.
The credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss if a customer or counterparty of a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
As of December 31, 2007 approximately 52 percent of the Group's trade receivables are due from three customers, which lead to a concentration of credit risks. Due to the absence of any historical default of payment or other known credit risks of these customers, no allowance has been recognized in this context.
 
The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The credit policy contains a judgment of the creditworthiness of each customer considering their financial situation as well as past experience and other factors. In the course of monitoring the credit risk, customers are classified according to their risk grading. The risk grading of all existing customers is reviewed annually.
No guarantees or other commitments have been granted that would lead to an increase of credit risk beyond the carrying amounts.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:
The liquidity risk is the risk that SEZ is unable to meet its financial obligations at maturity.
The table below shows the contractual maturities of financial liabilities held by SEZ, including estimated interest payments:
 
The market risk is the risk that changes in market rates and prices, as exchange rates, interest rates or share prices, may have an impact on the consolidated net profit and/or the market value of financial instruments held by SEZ.
The aim of managing such market risks is to monitor and control these risks in order to ensure that they do not exceed a defined limit.
a) Foreign currency risks
Owing to its international activities, SEZ is exposed to currency risks. These financial risks occur in connection with transactions, in particular the purchase and sale of goods, which are effected in currencies different from the functional currency of the company in question. The Group also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts for trading purposes.
 
The table below shows the maximum foreign exchange risks from financial instruments in which the currency involved is different than the functional currency of the subsidiary which holds these financial instruments:
As of December 31, 2007 the following derivatives exist:
 
A reasonably possible change of the following currencies at the balance sheet date would have increased (decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below:
For loans that are subject of the Net Investment Approach a change in currencies by 5 % would have resulted in an increase/decrease of consolidated equity by CHF 4,163,000.
b) Interest rate risks
The interest rate risk comprises the interest cash flow risk (the risk of fluctuating interest payments due to changes in market conditions) and the interest price risk (the risk of fluctuating fair values due to changes in market conditions).
Interest-bearing financial instruments are mainly cash and short and long term financial liabilities.
In the reporting period the finance lease contracts for leased buildings in Austria had a variable interest rate based on the 6 month EURIBOR. These financing costs therefore depend on the interest rate development. No interest related derivative contracts existed in the reporting year.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
No changes in the fair value of fixed rate instruments (fixed term deposits and debt) are recognized in profit and loss. Therefore a change in interest rates would not affect profit and loss.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
An increase in interest rates for finance leasing by 2 basis points would have increased the loss by CHF 468,000. An opposite change in interest rates would have had the equal but opposite effect on the loss, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
 
c) Market price risk
SEZ is exposed to the market price risk through its minority investment in ICS Technology Co. Ltd. Taiwan, the other financial assets as well as its investment in investment funds, structured products and shares of listed companies that are held for trading.
The carrying amount of financial instruments, that are exposed to the market price risk amounts to CHF 21,400,000.
An increase in market prices by 2 percent would have decreased the loss by CHF 428,000 and equity by the corresponding amount, due to the fact, that all changes are recognized in profit and loss. An opposite change in market prices would have had the equal but opposite effect on profit and loss and equity, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
30.5 Fair Values
The carrying amounts of cash, securities, other financial assets, other short-term receivables, trade receivables, prepaid expenses and accrued income, short term liabilities and finance lease liabilities are equivalent to their fair values, for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction.
 
The carrying amounts of each category of financial instruments, as defined in IAS 39, are as follows:
 
The capital managed by SEZ consists of the consolidated equity. SEZ has set the following goals for the management of its capital:
SEZ monitors the equity by key figures equity ratio and return on equity. The equity ratio equates to equity as a percentage of total assets. Return on equity is obtained by measuring net profit as percentage of average equity. These ratios are reported to the management board and board of directors regularly by internal financial reporting. SEZ pursues a solid balance sheet with a high equity ratio in order to be able to finance future investments and expenditures for research and development. As a medium term goal SEZ has defined a return on equity of 10 %.
The ratios are shown in the table below:
SEZ does not have any financial covenants with minimal capital requirements.
 
There are no events subsequent to the closing date, which would require an adjustment of the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
On December 11, 2007 the board of directors of SEZ Holding AG announced that a binding transaction agreement had been signed with Lam Research Corporation ("LAM"), headquartered in Fremont, California (USA). The agreement stipulated that LAM submit a public offer for all outstanding shares of SEZ Holding AG at a price of CHF 38 per registered share. On February 12, 2008 SEZ Holding AG published that LAM has declared the public tender offer successful. At the end of the additional offering period on February 26, 2008, 15,954,204 registered shares (including outstanding stock options) had been tendered, corresponding to 94.26 percent of all issued SEZ shares and all SEZ shares that could be created through the exercise of all outstanding employee stock options. On March 11, 2008 Lam completed the acquisition.
The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on May 27, 2008.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended June 29, 2008
FREMONT, Calif., July 29, 2008 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2008 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended June 29, 2008. Revenue for the period was $566.2 million, gross margin was $234.7 million and net income was $72.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $613.8 million, gross margin of $287.2 million and net income of $103.5 million, or $0.82 per diluted share for the March 2008 quarter. Shipments for the June 2008 quarter were $495 million compared to $658 million during the March 2008 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the June quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments related to an accelerated integration of SEZ, a net tax benefit as the result of the successful resolution of certain foreign tax matters, foreign currency gains on the purchase of SEZ, and costs associated with its voluntary internal stock option review. The Company's March 2008 quarter excluded certain costs related to the recent acquisition of SEZ, including the foreign currency gains on the purchase and the one-time charge for in-process research and development expense as well as the costs associated with its voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating income, ongoing net income, and ongoing diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $75.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share in the June 2008 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $109.8 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, for the March 2008 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the June 2008 quarter was $247.3 million or 43.7% compared to ongoing gross margin of $293.6 million, or 47.8%, for the March 2008 quarter. The sequential decline was primarily due to unfavorable customer and product mix, factory utilization levels, and inclusion of a full quarter of SEZ results. Ongoing operating expenses for the June 2008 quarter increased to $160.7 million compared with the March 2008 quarter of $148.9 million. This increase was due to the inclusion of a full quarter of SEZ.
 
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2008 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $1.2 billion at the end of the June 2008 quarter compared to $1.0 billion at the end of the March 2008 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were $198.3 million during the June quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2008 quarter were $193.6 million and $128.3 million, respectively. At the end of the June 2008 period, the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that is not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $52 million.
"During this period of continued reductions in wafer fab equipment investment, Lam Research is leveraging its flexible business model to reduce expenses while utilizing our strong cash generation capability to allow for continued strong investments in R&D activities, both in etch and adjacent new markets, that offer the opportunity for significant long-term revenue and earnings expansion," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer.
"The largest of those new opportunities is in single-wafer clean, where we continue to make significant investments. We have created a new organization for all of our clean products by integrating SEZ together with our C3 linear clean technology and 2300 Coronus plasma bevel clean divisions. We expect the investments in our family of clean products will provide us an excellent opportunity to grow our business in a market that we expect to double in size over the next few years." Newberry concluded.
 
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers, our expectations for wafer fab equipment investment, the leverage we can obtain from our business model and our ability and plan to reduce expenses, the value of continued investments in R&D activities and our family of clean products, the existence and magnitude of any opportunity for long-term revenue and earnings expansion, and the anticipated size of the market for our family of clean products. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the technical challenges presented by our new products. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 24, 2007, and Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended September 23, 2007, December 23, 2007, and March 30, 2008, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

On July 29, 2008, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release and held a conference call announcing its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2008. Following the conference call, investors expressed interest in the Company's backlog. The Company had planned to disclose backlog in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008 to be filed this quarter.
The Company's unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. The Company's policy is to revise its backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. In general, the Company schedules production of its systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and its customers' delivery requirements. Included in the Company's systems backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted, prices and product specifications have been agreed upon, and shipment of systems is expected within one year. The spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided. Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates, the Company uses volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period, not exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts. Generally, orders for the Company's products and services are subject to cancellation by its customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders, the Company's backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes nor actual revenue levels for succeeding periods. The Company's backlog as of June 29, 2008 approximated $400 million.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 and shall not be deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information in the Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Lam Research Corporation Announces $250 Million Share Repurchase Program
FREMONT, Calif., September 8, 2008 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company's common stock from the public market or in private purchases. The program is effective immediately.

As of June 29, 2008, Lam Research had approximately $1.2 billion in total gross cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments and approximately 125 million shares outstanding.
"The decision to repurchase our Company's shares reflects both management's and the board's confidence in our long-term growth prospects," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer of Lam Research.

These plans are dependent on the Company's future financial condition, and management's determinations of the continued value of a repurchase program, changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, success of our competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the technical challenges presented by our current product offerings as well as our new products.

"The moves we are announcing today broaden and deepen the strength of our executive team," stated Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer. "In Martin's seven-plus year career at Lam Research, he has been instrumental in executing the company's migration to a lean, outsourced operating model that has enabled us to generate new levels of profitability and efficiency. His strong knowledge of Lam's operations, in addition to his financial acumen, makes him ideal for the COO role."
"Ernie Maddock has been responsible for an increasingly vital series of finance and operating roles at Lam since joining us eleven years ago. He makes an excellent successor to Martin, bringing broad operational knowledge of our global organization and functions to the chief finance position. I'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with both Martin and Ernie, and their extended teams, as we implement these well-deserved appointments," Newberry concluded.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Earnings for the Quarter Ended September 28, 2008
FREMONT, Calif., October 22, 2008 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the September 2008 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced earnings for the quarter ended September 28, 2008. Revenue for the period was $440.4 million, gross margin was $183.1 million and net income was $8.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $566.2 million, gross margin of $234.7 million and net income of $72.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted share for the June 2008 quarter. Shipments for the September 2008 quarter were $345 million compared to $495 million during the June 2008 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the September quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments related to the integration of SEZ, net tax expense on accelerated tax planning strategy, and interest on the tax liability associated with the outcome of our previously disclosed voluntary internal stock option review. The Company's June 2008 quarter excluded certain SEZ integration costs, a net foreign tax benefit, foreign currency gains on the purchase of SEZ, and costs associated with our voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating income, ongoing net income, and ongoing diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $32.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the September 2008 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $75.8 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the June 2008 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2008 quarter was $186.2 million or 42.3%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $247.3 million, or 43.7%, for the June 2008 quarter. The sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to reduced factory utilization levels consistent with reduced business activity. Ongoing operating expenses for the September 2008 quarter decreased to $149.9 million compared with the June 2008 quarter of $160.7 million. This decrease was primarily due to savings realized from the June quarter restructuring activities and a significant decrease in all-employee variable compensation on lower profit levels.

Lam Announces Earnings for the September 2008 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the September 2008 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances remained at approximately $1.2 billion at the end of the September 2008 quarter, similar to the level at the end of the June 2008 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $43 million during the September quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the September 2008 quarter were $103.5 million and $76.4 million, respectively. At the end of the September 2008 quarter, the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that was not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $41 million.
"Our September quarter results reflect the challenging environment for semiconductor equipment and the worsening conditions throughout the global economy," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "While the length and volatility of this downturn are unpredictable at this time, we remain focused on our ability to deliver long term sustainable growth while implementing appropriate actions consistent with our shorter term financial objectives. We are managing through the current weakness by making effective use of our strong balance sheet and significant cash position to make targeted, strategic investments while also prudently managing our operating expense structure. We believe these efforts will help us emerge from the present environment in a strong position to enable future revenue and profit growth," Newberry concluded.

Indemnification Agreements
     The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, at its regularly scheduled meeting on November 6, 2008, authorized the Company to enter into Indemnification Agreements with each of its Section 16 executive officers and directors. The form of Indemnification Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.148.
     Each Indemnification Agreement provides that, subject to certain exclusions, the Company shall indemnify the applicable Section 16 executive officer or director to the fullest extent permitted by law, including any greater indemnification that is afforded by a subsequent change in applicable law. The Indemnification Agreement also provides, among other things, for advancement of expenses and independent or disinterested determinations as to whether the standard for indemnification under the Indemnification Agreement has been met, and governs other procedural matters related to indemnification. The rights afforded to the indemnified persons under the Indemnification Agreements are not exclusive of other rights of indemnification such persons may enjoy under the Company's bylaws. The foregoing description of the Indemnification Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the form of such agreements attached hereto as Exhibit 10.148.
Stock Option Reformations
     During the Company's voluntary internal stock option review that was completed earlier this year, the Company concluded that certain stock options ("misdated options") granted in prior years to certain current independent members of the Board of Directors as well as to the current Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman had an exercise price which was less than the closing price of the Company's common stock on the appropriate measurement date for financial accounting purposes.
Table of Contents
     The Board determined that all currently outstanding and unexercised misdated options for the individuals noted below should be reformed to reflect an exercise price equal to the appropriate fair market value per share on the appropriate measurement date.
     The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to enter into a Reformation of Stock Option Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10.149 with each of these individuals to reform certain misdated options held by them. As a result of the reformations, the exercise prices of the misdated options will be shown as equal to the appropriate fair market value per share on the correct measurement date. No payments will be made to any of these option holders in connection with these amendments.
     The Reformation of Stock Option Agreements will correct the exercise price of misdated options granted to each of Messrs. Arscott, Berdahl, Elkus, Harris, Inman, Newberry, and Bagley, as illustrated in the table below:

Company
                    
                    
Indemnitee
     WHEREAS, the Company desires to attract and retain the services of highly qualified individuals, such as Indemnitee, to serve the Company;
     WHEREAS, in order to induce Indemnitee to continue to provide services to the Company, the Company wishes to provide for the indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, Indemnitee to the maximum extent permitted by law;

     WHEREAS, the Company and Indemnitee recognize the difficulty that companies sometimes experience obtaining appropriate levels of liability insurance for the companies' directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries, the significant cost of such insurance and the limited scope of coverage of such insurance;
     WHEREAS, the Company and Indemnitee further recognize the significant amount of corporate litigation in general, subjecting directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries to expensive litigation risks at the same time as the cost, limited availability and scope of coverage of liability insurance continues, constituting substantial challenges for the Company;
     WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection currently provided by applicable law, the Company's governing documents and available insurance as adequate under the present circumstances, and the Indemnitee and certain other directors, officers, employees, agents and fiduciaries of the Company may not be willing to continue to serve in such capacities without additional protection;
     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "") has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining highly qualified persons such as Indemnitee is detrimental to the best interests of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;
Board
 
     WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified; and
     WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the indemnification provided in the Bylaws and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants contained herein, the Company and Indemnitee do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise) and Indemnitee. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a [director][officer] of the Company.

provided, however
provided, however,
 
this Agreement or to purport to modify the professional obligations of Indemnitee's legal counsel. Advances shall be unsecured and interest free. Advances shall be made without regard to Indemnitee's ability to repay the expenses and without regard to Indemnitee's ultimate entitlement to indemnification under the other provisions of this Agreement. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement. The Indemnitee shall qualify for advances upon the execution and delivery to the Company of this Agreement which shall constitute an undertaking providing that the Indemnitee undertakes to the fullest extent required by law to repay the advance if and to the extent that it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment, not subject to appeal, that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company. This Section 9 shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to Section 8. The right to advances under this paragraph shall in all events continue until final disposition of any Proceeding, including any appeal therein.
     Section 10. .
Procedure for Notification and Defense of Claim
          (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor to the Company.
          (b) The Company will be entitled, but not obliged, to participate in the Proceeding at its own expense.
     Section 11. .
Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification
          (a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by the Board, by a majority vote of the directors of the Company who are not parties to the Proceeding, and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. In the event that (i) there are no disinterested directors serving on the Board, (ii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to the preceding sentence within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iii) a determination is made pursuant to the preceding sentence that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or (iv) there has been a Company Change in Control prior to the determination by the Board, Indemnitee shall be entitled to have his [or her] entitlement to indemnification to be determined by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee and, if it is so determined by Independent Counsel that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
          (b) Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Board or Independent Counsel, as applicable, making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to the Board or such counsel, as applicable, upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Board or Independent
 
Counsel, as applicable, shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
          (c) In the event that Indemnitee exercises his [or her] right to have his [or her] entitlement to indemnification determined by Independent Counsel as contemplated by Section 11(a), the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee. The Company may, within ten (10) days after written notice of such selection, deliver to the Indemnitee a written objection to such selection; , , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, and the final disposition of the Proceeding, including any appeal therein, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, the Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company to the selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
provided
however
          (d) In the event that Independent Counsel is selected to make the determination of Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification as contemplated by clause (ii) or (iii) of the second sentence of Section 11(a), neither the failure of the Board to have made a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Board that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct, and the Independent Counsel making such determination shall be bound by the presumptions set forth in Section 12.
          (e) The rights set forth in this Section 11 with respect to Indemnitee selecting Independent Counsel to determine Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, Indemnitee's rights set forth in Section 13.
     Section 12. .
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
          (a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the Board or Independent Counsel, as applicable, making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and
 
the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by the Independent Counsel of any determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Board or of Independent Counsel to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Board or by Independent Counsel that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
          (b) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty, or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
          (c) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or the Board or counsel selected by any committee of the Board or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, investment banker or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or the Board or any committee of the Board. The provisions of this Section 12(c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
          (d) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
     Section 13. .
Remedies of Indemnitee
          (a) Subject to Section 13(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the last sentence of Section 11(b) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of his entitlement to such indemnification or advancement of Expenses. Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
 
Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a); , , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his rights under Section 5 of this Agreement. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
provided
however
          (b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.
          (c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
          (d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such Expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advance of Expenses from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery, as the case may be, in the suit for which indemnification or advances is being sought.
          (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding, including any appeal therein.
     Section 14. .
Non-exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation
          (a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement of Expenses as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Charter, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right
 
of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Charter, Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
          (b) The Company currently maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Company or of any other Enterprise, and to the extent liability insurance coverage of comparable scope can continue to be purchased at reasonable cost, the Company shall continue to maintain such coverage. Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. Where it is feasible to do so without materially impairing the Indemnitee's ability to defend himself [or herself] in a Proceeding, Indemnitee agrees to cooperate with the Company to maximize the insurance coverage applicable to a particular Proceeding, including without limitation by agreeing to be jointly represented by legal counsel with other directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company who are also involved with the Proceeding, or by agreeing to legal representation by a legal services provider acceptable to the insurance carrier(s) that underwrite the liability insurance coverage purchased by the Company; that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to pressure an Indemnitee's or his [or her] legal counsel to violate any applicable rule of professional responsibility applicable to legal counsel's provision of legal services.
provided, however,
          (c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
          (d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
          (e) The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
 
employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of Expenses from such other Enterprise. Where Indemnitee has indemnification rights relating to a Proceeding through both the Company and any other Enterprise involved with the Proceeding and the other Enterprise disputes primary responsibility to advance Expenses to or indemnify Indemnitee, the indemnification rights under this Agreement shall apply; that the Company's agreement to protect Indemnitee will be without prejudice to any rights the Company may have to seek from such other Enterprise reimbursement of any Expenses or other amounts paid on behalf of Indemnitee.
provided, however,
     Section 15. . This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) ten (10) years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a [director][officer] of the Company or (b) one (1) year after the final termination of any Proceeding, including any appeal, then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement of Expenses hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement relating thereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his heirs, executors and administrators. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
Duration of Agreement
     Section 16. . If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On November 20, 2008, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") commenced a restructuring plan that is designed to better align the Company's cost structure with its business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Restructuring Plan consists of a reduction in force of approximately 600 regular, temporary and contract employee positions, or approximately 15% of the Company's total workforce. The timing and scope of reductions in the Company's workforce will vary by country based on local legal requirements. The Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during the first calendar quarter of 2009. When completed, the Restructuring Plan is expected to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $60 million. The Company is implementing further cost reduction activities which are not part of the Restructuring Plan that are targeted to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $20 million for a total annualized cost savings of approximately $80 million. All of the charges under the Restructuring Plan will result in cash expenditures and will be recorded in the current and following quarter. The Company is unable at this time to make a good faith determination of cost estimates, or ranges of cost estimates, associated with the program as set forth in paragraphs (b) (c) and (d) of Item 2.05 of Form 8-K.

Lam Research Corporation Updates 2008 December Quarter Outlook
FREMONT, Calif., December 19, 2008 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that it has revised its previously issued financial outlook for the quarter ending December 28, 2008 to reflect continued deterioration in semiconductor equipment market conditions.
Lam Research now expects that its performance for the December 2008 quarter will be as follows:
On November 20, 2008 Lam Research announced restructuring activities and other cost reduction actions targeted to reduce expenses by $15 million to $20 million per quarter. As detailed in the Company's amended 8-K filing on December 19, 2008 the charges associated with the restructuring activity are expected to be approximately $20 million to $26 million. These charges consist of approximately $15 million to $20 million of cash charges related to one-time termination benefits associated with the Company's reduction in force as well as non-cash charges for asset impairments of approximately $5 million to $6 million. The Company expects to complete the restructuring plan during the first calendar quarter of 2009.
"Business conditions in the semiconductor equipment sector have deteriorated further in recent weeks. The weakness in memory pricing, the softening end-user demand environment, and restrictions in the capital markets have caused our customers to dramatically reduce their equipment purchases", said Steve Newberry, president and chief executive officer of Lam Research. "As a result of these conditions we are adjusting our December quarter outlook and we expect this challenging environment will persist going into 2009. Throughout this economic cycle we are maintaining focused expense discipline to preserve a strong balance sheet with healthy cash balances," Newberry concluded.
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to expectations regarding results for the December 2008 quarter, estimated ranges of restructuring charges, the ability to preserve a strong balance sheet and cash balances. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, and the challenges presented by our new products and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies into our existing business. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2008 and the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2008, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 28, 2008
FREMONT, Calif., January 28, 2009 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2008 quarter were:
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 28, 2008. Revenue for the period was $283.4 million, gross margin was $101.4 million and net loss was $(24.2) million, or $(0.19) per diluted share, compared to revenue of $440.4 million, gross margin of $183.1 million and net income of $8.9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the September 2008 quarter. Shipments for the December 2008 quarter were $226 million compared to $345 million during the September 2008 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2008 quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments designed to better align the Company's cost structure with its business opportunities in consideration of market and economic uncertainties, a net tax benefit related to the renewal of the research and development tax credit, net tax expense on resolution of certain tax items, one-time costs associated with the restructuring of an employee benefit plan, exchange rate loss associated with the Company's accelerated tax planning strategy, and interest on the tax liability associated with the outcome of the Company's previously disclosed voluntary internal stock option review. The Company's September 2008 quarter excluded certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments related to the integration of SEZ, net tax expense on accelerated tax planning strategy, and interest on the tax liability associated with the outcome of the Company's previously disclosed voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating income, ongoing net income, and ongoing diluted earnings per share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net loss was $(11.7) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share in the December 2008 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $32.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the September 2008 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the December 2008 quarter was $109.1 million or 38.5%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $186.2 million, or 42.3%, for the September 2008 quarter. The sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to reduced manufacturing and field utilization levels and product mix challenges resulting from the reduced business activity. Ongoing operating expenses for the December 2008 quarter decreased to $126.5 million compared with the September 2008 quarter of $149.9 million. This decrease was driven by a reduction in employee variable compensation expenses, a reduction in deferred compensation liabilities due to recent stock market declines, and the partial quarter impact of the Company's December quarter restructuring activities.

The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2008 quarter is shown in the following table:
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.1 billion at the end of the December 2008 quarter, compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the September 2008 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $(39.0) million during the December quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the December 2008 quarter were $68.4 million and $54.2 million, respectively. At the end of the December 2008 quarter, the anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped to Japanese customers that was not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $8.6 million.
"The global semiconductor industry has entered one of the most difficult periods in its history, one that is presenting severe challenges to our customers and thus severely limiting investment in wafer fab equipment," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "While this environment will persist near-term, we remain optimistic about our long-term technology roadmap in etch, clean and other new markets. During the pause in customer spending we are strategically targeting our capital resources to new penetration opportunities, qualifying our next-generation tools and delivering cost-effective technology solutions aimed at reducing our customers' production costs. Our objective through these actions is to deliver superior value to our customers and emerge from this period of reduced spending well positioned to deliver strong financial and operational performance," Newberry concluded.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Adoption of Performance Goals For Calendar Year 2009 under the Company's 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Program
     The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established performance factors and target amounts for the first six months of 2009 under the Company's 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2008/2009 MYIP"), a program under the Company's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP"), for Martin B. Anstice, Richard A. Gottscho, Abdi Hariri, and Ernest E. Maddock. A similar recommendation by the Committee with respect to Stephen G. Newberry was also approved by the independent members of the Board.
     Awards under the 2008/2009 MYIP will vest, to the extent earned, and be paid in cash in 2010. For the first six months of 2009, the performance factor is a metric related to ongoing operating cash flow. The multiplier resulting from achievement of this factor may be additionally enhanced by a stock price performance multiplier. Actual payouts may vary from 0 to 2.5 times target amounts.
Adoption of 2009/2010 Long-Term Incentive Program
     The Committee also authorized a 2009/2010 Long-Term Incentive Program (the "2009/2010 LTIP") covering calendar years 2009 and 2010, and set 2009 target amounts under the program for Mr. Anstice, Dr. Gottscho, Mr. Hariri and Mr. Maddock. A similar recommendation by the Committee with respect to Mr. Newberry was approved by the independent members of the Board.
     The 2009/2010 LTIP has two components: (1) a cash component pursuant to a 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2009/2010 MYIP") established under the EIP, and (2) an equity component (the "2009 Long-Term Equity Component") governed by the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the 2009/2010 LTIP, one-half of the target amount is allocated to the 2009/2010 MYIP and the other half to the 2009 Long-Term Equity Component .
     Accruals under the 2009/2010 MYIP will be based on the Company's performance during calendar years 2009 and 2010, and awards will vest, to the extent earned, and be paid in cash in 2011. The performance factor for the first six months of 2009 under the 2009/2010 MYIP is the same as that for the first six months of 2009 under the 2008/2009 MYIP. Actual payouts may vary from 0 to 2.5 times target amounts.
     Under the 2009 Long-Term Equity Component, each named executive officer received, on February 26, 2009, a grant of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and a stock option grant. The number of RSUs granted equals one-half of the target amount allocated to the 2009 Long-Term Equity Component divided by $20.21, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Each named executive officer also was granted a stock option covering 2.5 shares of the Company's common stock for each RSU granted. The stock options have an exercise price equal to $20.21, the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, and will have a five-year term. The RSUs and options will vest on the second anniversary of the grant date.

Adoption of Annual Incentive Program Performance Goals for Calendar Year 2009
          The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") established performance objectives for its calendar year 2009 annual incentive program (the "2009 AIP"), a program under the Company's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan and the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, for Martin B. Anstice, Richard A. Gottscho, Abdi Hariri, and Ernest E. Maddock. A similar recommendation by the Committee with respect to Stephen G. Newberry was also approved by the independent members of the Board.
          The 2009 AIP provides for the payment of performance-based compensation based on cash target amounts, which are established as a percentage of base salary. These cash target amounts will be paid out based on the achievement of specified performance factors, including metrics related to ongoing operational cash flow and to specific business unit performance. Each named executive officer ("NEO") other than Mr. Newberry and Mr. Anstice has additional performance factors specifically relating to performance of his business unit or other organization. For Messrs. Newberry and Anstice, the weighting of the performance factors is: ongoing operational cash flow factor, 50%, and business unit performance factors, collectively 50%. Performance factors for the other NEOs include the ongoing operational cash flow factor and some or all of the business unit performance factors assigned to Messrs. Newberry and Anstice, which for those NEOs are collectively weighted at 50%, as well as organization-specific performance factors, which also are collectively weighted for those NEOs at 50%.
          Awards under the 2009 AIP will be delivered, at the discretion of the Committee, in the form of cash, Company stock, or a combination thereof. The determination of the form of payment will be made in early 2010. The stock portion, if any, of each award will be determined by dividing the cash value of such portion of the award by the closing price of the Company's stock on a date selected by the Committee when making the determination to pay some or all of any payment in stock. The maximum amounts payable under the AIP, as a percentage of the participant's 2009 base salary, are: Mr. Newberry, 125%; Mr. Anstice, 85%; Mr. Maddock, 80%; Dr. Gottscho, 75%; and Mr. Hariri, 70%.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
On March 19, 2009, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") commenced a restructuring plan that is designed to align the Company's cost structure with its outlook for the current economic environment and future business opportunities (the "Restructuring Plan"). The Company expects to incur certain cash charges in connection with a workforce reduction of approximately 375 regular, temporary and contract employee positions, or approximately 10% of the Company's total workforce. It is estimated that approximately 225 of the employee positions to be eliminated are located in North America, with the remainder located throughout Asia and Europe. These workforce reductions are expected to be largely completed by the June 2009 quarter but the timing of actions may vary by country based on local legal requirements. The Restructuring Plan is also expected to include certain cash and non-cash charges related to the exit of facilities the Company will cease to use and non-cash charges for asset impairments. The Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed by the June 2009 quarter.
The Restructuring Plan is targeted at reducing the Company's cost structure by approximately $85 million to $95 million on an annualized basis. The Company expects to see the full benefit of these cost reductions in the June 2009 quarter. These savings are in addition to the $94 million of annualized cost savings from restructuring plans announced in calendar year 2008. The Company currently expects to incur total charges under the Restructuring Plan of approximately $20 million to $23 million during the quarter ending March 29, 2009. These charges consist of approximately $18 million to $20 million of cash charges related to one-time termination benefits associated with the Company's reduction in force, approximately $1 million to $2 million of cash charges for facilities-related expenses, and non-cash charges for asset impairments of approximately $1 million.
The Company expects to realize additional cost savings and record incremental exit costs in the June 2009 quarter for facilities it will cease to use. The Company is unable at this time to make a good faith determination of cost estimates, or ranges of cost estimates, associated with all of the June 2009 quarter activities under the Plan as set forth in paragraphs (b) (c) and (d) of Item 2.05 of Form 8-K. In accordance with paragraph (d) of Item 2.05, the Company will timely file an amendment to this report after its determination of such estimates or ranges of estimates.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(b) Effective March 30, 2009, Abdi Hariri, currently the Group Vice President of the Customer Support Business Group, will assume the position of Group Vice President of Global Operations.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Company intends to make an early repayment of its long-term debt with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. ("ABN AMRO") during the quarter ending March 29, 2009. As of March 19, 2009, the outstanding principal balance under the agreement with ABN AMRO was $237.5 million, with originally scheduled principal repayment terms of (a) $12.5 million due in each of the June 2009 and December 2009 quarters and (b) the remaining principal amount of $212.5 million due on March 6, 2010. The Company plans to prepay the entire outstanding principal amount of $237.5 million during the quarter ending March 29, 2009. There are no pre-payment penalties associated with the repayment.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 29, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., April 22, 2009 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 29, 2009. Revenue for the period was $174.4 million, gross margin was $36.5 million and net loss was $(198.4) million, or $(1.58) per diluted share, compared to revenue of $283.4 million, gross margin of $101.4 million and net loss of $(24.2) million, or $(0.19) per diluted share, for the December 2008 quarter. Shipments for the March 2009 quarter were $159 million compared to $226 million during the December 2008 quarter.
As a result of a combination of factors, including the current economic environment, a sustained decline in the Company's market valuation and a decline in the Company's operating results, the Company has concluded that the fair value of its Clean Product Group has been reduced below its carrying value. As a result, the Company has recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $89.1 million during the March 2009 quarter. The goodwill impairment charge is based on the Company's current best estimate. If there is a change to this estimate, it will be reflected in the March 2009 quarter financial statements included in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2009, which is anticipated to be filed on or before May 8, 2009.
The Company's ongoing results for the March 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, the goodwill impairment charge noted above, a net tax expense for a change in state tax law, a net tax expense and an exchange rate gain associated with the Company's accelerated tax planning strategy, an investment impairment, and interest on the tax liability associated with the outcome of the Company's previously disclosed voluntary internal stock option review. The Company's ongoing results for the December 2008 quarter excluded certain costs for restructuring activities and asset impairments, a net tax benefit related to the renewal of the research and development tax credit, net tax expense on resolution of certain tax items, one-time costs associated with the restructuring of an employee benefit plan, a net tax benefit and an exchange rate loss associated with the Company's accelerated tax planning strategy, and interest on the tax liability associated with the outcome of the Company's previously disclosed voluntary internal stock option review. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating loss, ongoing net loss, and ongoing net loss per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net loss was $(89.8) million, or $(0.71) per diluted share in the March 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net loss of $(11.7) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, for the December 2008 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2009 quarter was $46.7 million or 26.8%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $109.1 million, or 38.5%, for the December 2008 quarter. The sequential decline in gross margin was primarily due to lower manufacturing and field utilization levels resulting from reduced business activity as well as product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the March 2009 quarter increased to $128.9 million compared with the December 2008 quarter of $126.5 million. This increase was driven by additional accounts receivables reserves for specific distressed customers, partially offset by a reduction in employee expenses as a result of restructuring and other cost-savings activities.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the March 2009 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2009 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $806.4 million at the end of the March 2009 quarter, compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the December 2008 quarter. The Company paid the outstanding principal balance of $237.5 million of its long-term debt during the March 2009 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $(24.2) million during the March 2009 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the March 2009 quarter were $43.7 million and $36.1 million, respectively. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $7.5 million as of March 29, 2009.
"We are developing next-generation technology solutions alongside our customers and are continuing to win new application tool selection decisions in both etch and clean at the leading-edge technology nodes. We are fortunate to have a strong balance sheet with sufficient cash to: continue making investments in key R&D programs, place next-generation tools at customer sites for joint development projects and evaluations, and deploy inventories to meet short-term shipment requirements as well as respond to any future increases in demand," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "Our focus remains on investing in strategic opportunities while aggressively managing the cost structure and cash expenditures of the Company. This will enhance our ability to meet the expectations and needs of our customers and strengthen our market position for the next upturn," Newberry concluded.
 
Lam Announces Financial Results for the March 2009 Quarter
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to our estimate of the goodwill impairment charge, the anticipated revenue from shipments to Japanese customers, the potential uses of our cash and other assets, and our ability to develop next generation technology solutions, win new application tool selection decisions in both etch and clean, continue to be able to invest in research and development, place next-generation tools at customer sites, be successful in deploying our inventory to meet demand, focus on and invest in strategic opportunities, be successful in managing our cost structure and cash expenditures, meet the expectations and needs of our customers, and strengthen our market position. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: difficult business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those conditions, factors that tend to make our quarterly results more volatile (such as exchange rate fluctuations), changing customer demands, the actions of our competitors, and the challenges presented by the development and marketing of our new products and the integration of acquired businesses and technologies into our existing business. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2008, and Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 28, 2008 and December 28, 2008, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations.

Table of Contents
On May 15, 2009, the Company's Board of Directors amended and restated the Company's Bylaws, effective as of such date. The amendment and restatement made the following changes to the Bylaws:
Advance Notice Provision
The Company's Bylaws previously contained an advance notice bylaw requiring, generally, that a stockholder intending to nominate a candidate for election to the Board of Directors or otherwise propose business at an annual meeting must provide notice to the Company at least 60 days in advance of the meeting and otherwise comply with the securities laws. The amended and restated Bylaws revise the advance notice bylaw to require a stockholder intending to nominate candidates for an election to the Board of Directors or otherwise to propose business at an annual meeting to (a) provide notice at least 45 days prior to the anniversary of the mailing of the previous year's proxy statement of the Company and (b) provide additional disclosure regarding, among other things, derivative instruments and short positions in the Company's stock held by such stockholder. The advance notice provisions also apply to certain special meetings where directors of the Company are to be elected by requiring a stockholder to submit nominations no later than the later of the ninetieth day prior to the meeting and the tenth day following the announcement of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at the special meeting.
Record Dates
The amended and restated Bylaws also reflect a change regarding an anticipated amendment to Delaware law allowing separate record dates for notice and for voting.
Access to List of Stockholders
The amended and restated Bylaws reflect a recent amendment to the Delaware law governing the Company's obligation to make a list of stockholders available in connection with each stockholder meeting.
Elimination of Dissolution Provisions
The amended and restated Bylaws delete the articles of the Bylaws addressing dissolution and the appointment of a custodian to replace the Company's board in certain limited circumstances.
The amended and restated Bylaws also reflect a previously approved amendment adopted in December 2007 to permit the issuance of shares without stock certificates.
The text of the amended and restated Bylaws is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

Adopted May 15, 2009
 
(a) An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the board of directors shall each year fix.
(b) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (1) pursuant to the corporation's proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (2) by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (3) by any stockholder of record of the corporation (the "Record Stockholder") at the time of the giving of the notice required in the following paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (3) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or propose business (other than business included in the corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (such act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) at an annual meeting of stockholders.
(c) For nominations or business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a Record Stockholder pursuant to clause (3) of the foregoing paragraph, (1) the Record Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation, (2) any such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and (3) the Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, must have acted in accordance with the representations set forth in the Solicitation Statement required by these bylaws. To be timely, a Record Stockholder's notice shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 45 or more than 75 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.2(c), if the meeting is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the Record Stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day before such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there has been no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or indicating the increase in the size of the board of directors made by the corporation at
 
least 10 days before the last day a Record Stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with the preceding sentence, a Record Stockholder's notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a Record Stockholder's notice.
(d) Such Record Stockholder's notice shall set forth:
1. if such notice pertains to the nomination of directors, as to each person whom the Record Stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, and such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected;
2. as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
3. as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "party"):
(i) the name and address of each such party;
(ii)(A) the class, series, and number of shares of the corporation that are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by each such party, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by each such party, and any
 
other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which either party has a right to vote, directly or indirectly, any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation held by each such party (for purposes of this Section 2.2(d), a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially directly or indirectly by each such party that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which either party is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that each such party is directly or indirectly entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of each such party's immediate family sharing the same household (which information set forth in this paragraph shall be supplemented by such stockholder or such beneficial owner, as the case may be, not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date);
(iii) any other information relating to each such party that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and
(iv) a statement whether or not each such party will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation reasonably believed by the Record Stockholder or beneficial holder, as the case may be, to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by the Record Stockholder (such statement, a "Solicitation Statement").
 
(e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at an annual meeting unless (i) the person is nominated by a Record Stockholder in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(3) or (ii) the person is nominated by or at the direction of the board of directors. Only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these bylaws, to declare that such defectively proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
(f) For purposes of these bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.2. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders, other than those required by statute, may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the president. The board of directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.
(b) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors. The notice of such special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) by any stockholder
 
of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the secretary setting forth the information set forth in Section 2.2(d)(1) and 2.2(d)(3) of this Article II. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder of record's notice required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder of record's notice. A person shall not be eligible for election or reelection as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) by a stockholder of record in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Article II.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.3. Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
 
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
 
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
Except as set forth in the immediately following paragraph of this Section 2.8 or otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. The board of directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
 
At the election of directors of the corporation, each holder of stock or of any class or classes or of a series or series thereof shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal the number of which (except for such provision as to cumulative voting) he would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to his shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be elected by him, and he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute them among the number for, or for any two or more of them as he may see fit; provided, however, that no stockholder shall be entitled to so cumulate such stockholder's votes unless the candidates for which such stockholder is voting have been placed in nomination in accordance with Section 2.2 of this Article II and a stockholder has given timely notice of an intention to cumulate votes. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than sixty (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting; , however, that in the event that less than seventy (70) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. If any one stockholder has given proper notice of an intention to cumulate votes pursuant to this Section 2.8, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for candidates properly in nomination.
provided
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has
 
been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
In the event of the delivery to the corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and any revocation thereof is referred to in this Section 2.10 as a "Consent"), the secretary of the corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consents and shall as soon as practicable thereafter conduct such reasonable investigation as he deems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the validity of such Consents and all matters incident thereto, including, without limitation, whether the holders of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consents have given consents. No consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be effective unless delivered to the corporation within sixty (60) days following the record date relating thereto fixed pursuant to this Section 2.10.
 
Except as otherwise permitted by law, in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, in the manner provided by law. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
 
The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors then in office.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
 
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold. office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot.
 
Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
A vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by a court order may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for
 
such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor shall be elected and qualified.
 
The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
 
The first meeting of each newly elected board. of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors , or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
 
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice if the times of such meetings are fixed by the board of directors.
 
Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be given to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. Notice of such special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either (i) by mail not less than four (4) days before the date of the meeting, or (ii) personally, by telephone, telecopy, telegram, telex or other similar means of communication on twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director whom the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.
 
At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
 
If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
 
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
 
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attending each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attending each meeting of the board of directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
 
The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiaries who is not an "executive officer" (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or a director of the corporation, whenever in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.
 
Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors; provided, however, that, so long as stockholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his or her removal would be sufficient to elect him or her if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire board of directors.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.
 
The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the board of directors, a chairman of the board of directors, who shall not be considered an officer of the corporation solely by reason of being appointed to such position.
 
The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee.

A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney of such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for, a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
 
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any uncertificated shares.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 28, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., July 29, 2009 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 28, 2009. Revenue for the period was $217.8 million, gross margin was $67.8 million and net loss was $(88.5) million, or $(0.70) per diluted share, compared to revenue of $174.4 million, gross margin of $36.5 million and net loss of $(198.4) million, or $(1.58) per diluted share, for the March 2009 quarter. Shipments for the June 2009 quarter were $246 million compared to $159 million during the March 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the June 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, a legal judgment, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, certain one-time contract termination costs, a net tax expense for valuation allowance, net tax expense on resolution of certain tax matters, and interest and legal fees related to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A tax expenses. The Company's ongoing results for the March 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a net tax expense for a change in state tax law, a net tax expense and an exchange rate gain associated with the Company's accelerated tax planning strategy, an investment impairment, and interest on Internal Revenue Code Section 409A tax expenses. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating loss, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net loss, and ongoing net loss per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing ongoing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, and enhances the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net loss was $(57.0) million, or $(0.45) per diluted share in the June 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net loss of $(89.8) million, or $(0.71) per diluted share, for the March 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the June 2009 quarter was $67.8 million or 31.1%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $46.7 million, or 26.8%, for the March 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory and field utilization due to increased business volume. Ongoing operating expenses for the June 2009 quarter decreased to $114.3 million compared with the March 2009 quarter of $128.9 million. This decrease was driven by a full quarter savings in employee-related expenses and other cost reduction measures that were a part of the March 2009 quarter restructuring. In addition, in the March 2009 quarter, the Company recorded accounts receivable reserves for specific distressed customers that did not recur in the June 2009 quarter.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the June 2009 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2009 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $757.8 million at the end of the June 2009 quarter, compared to $806.4 million at the end of the March 2009 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $(58.1) million during the June 2009 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2009 quarter were $64.7 million and $45.8 million, respectively. Our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $13 million as of June 28, 2009.
"Relative to the March quarter, business conditions improved in the June quarter, contributing to Lam's ability to show improved financial results for the quarter. Shipments and revenues increased as a result of customer investments to add wafer starts at the leading edge in both foundry and memory, as well as higher fab utilization contributing to improvement in the customer service business," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "While we are encouraged that our customers have increased spending on equipment, we plan to maintain our focus on cash management while continuing our strategic investments in leading-edge solutions for our customers' current and next-generation wafer fabrication needs," Newberry concluded.
 
Lam Announces Financial Results for the June 2009 Quarter
Statements made in this press release which are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements relate, but are not limited, to the anticipated revenue from shipments to Japanese customers, the potential uses of our cash and other assets, our business focus on minimizing cash expenditures and making strategic investments in providing leading-edge solutions, and our projections for future business conditions. Some factors that may affect these forward-looking statements include: difficult business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy and the efficacy of our plans for reacting to those conditions, changing customer demands, the actions of our competitors, and the challenges presented by the development and marketing of our new products. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including specifically the report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 29, 2008, and the reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 28, 2008, December 28, 2008, and March 29, 2009, which could cause actual results to vary from expectations. The Company undertakes no obligation to update the information or statements made in this press release.

Mr. Newberry is also entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally, subject to the applicable terms and conditions of such plans and the determination of the independent members of the Board, and to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan. Mr. Newberry will receive other benefits, such as health insurance, vacation, and other benefit plans and compensation programs generally applicable to executive officers of the Company.
If a "change in control" (as defined in the Newberry Agreement) of the Company occurs during the period of Mr. Newberry's employment under the Newberry Agreement, and if there is an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Newberry Agreement) of Mr. Newberry's employment either in contemplation of or within the 12 months following such change in control, Mr. Newberry will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 18 months of Mr. Newberry's then-current base salary (without giving effect to any salary reduction program currently in place), plus an amount equal to the average of the last five annual payments made to Mr. Newberry under the Company's Annual Incentive Plan or any predecessor or successor plans (the "Short Term Plan," and such average, the "Short Term Plan Average"), plus an additional amount equal to the Short Term Plan Average multiplied by the number of full months worked in the calendar year in which Mr. Newberry's employment is terminated divided by twelve; (2) payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan which were earned by Mr. Newberry but not yet paid; (3) medical benefits, as described in the Newberry Agreement; (4) vesting, as of the date of termination, of the unvested portions of any stock option or restricted stock unit awards granted to Mr. Newberry prior to the change in control, and issuance of shares underlying any restricted stock units ("RSUs") within 10 days of the date of termination; and (5) payment of any amounts accrued as of the change in control under any long-term cash-based variable compensation plans of the Company (the "Long Term Plans"), plus an amount equal to the remaining target amount under the Long Term Plans.
If Mr. Newberry is involuntarily terminated other than in connection with a change in control, he will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 18 months of Mr. Newberry's then-current base salary (without giving effect to any salary reduction program currently in place), plus an amount equal to the Short Term Plan Average, plus an amount equal to the amount which Mr. Newberry would have earned under the Short Term Plan for such calendar year multiplied by the number of full months worked in the calendar year in which Mr. Newberry's employment is terminated divided by twelve (the "Pro-Rated Short Term Plan Amount"); (2) payment of certain accrued but unpaid amounts under the Short Term Plan and any Long Term Plan; (3) medical benefits, as described in the Newberry Agreement; and (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs that were granted twelve (12) months or more before the termination date, in an amount such that the total vested shares under any such awards equals the total number of calendar months worked, divided by the total number of months over which such award vests, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such award.
In the event of Mr. Newberry's death or disability, he (or his estate) will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's then-current base salary (without giving effect to any salary reduction program currently in place) less, in the case of Mr. Newberry's death, certain insurance payments plus the Pro-Rated Short Term Plan Amount; (2) payment of certain accrued but unpaid amounts under the Short Term Plan and any Long Term Plan; (3) medical benefits (in the case of Mr. Newberry's death, benefits to which Mr. Newberry's dependents are entitled); and (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs, in an amount equal to the greater of 50% of such awards or an amount such that the total vested shares under any such awards equals the total number of calendar months worked, divided by the total number of months over which such award vests, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such award.
In the event of any other termination of Mr. Newberry's employment during the term of the Newberry Agreement, Mr. Newberry will be entitled to payment of any earned but unpaid base salary, any accrued and unused vacation, and reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the business of the Company. If Mr. Newberry voluntarily resigns, he will be entitled to no additional benefits, any unvested stock options will be cancelled 90 days after the date of termination unless earlier exercised, and any RSUs will be cancelled on the date of termination.
The Newberry Agreement subjects Mr. Newberry to customary confidentiality and non-competition obligations during the term of the Newberry Agreement, and non-solicitation obligations for a period of six months following the termination of his employment.
Anstice Agreement
The terms of the Anstice Agreement are substantively similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, with the following material differences:
The Anstice Agreement provides that Mr. Anstice shall serve as an Executive Vice President of the Company.
Under the Anstice Agreement, Mr. Anstice will receive a base salary of $450,000 ($393,750 per year while the Company's executive salary reduction program remains in effect), subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board.
The severance terms of the Anstice Agreement are generally similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, provided that (1) Mr. Anstice will receive 12 months' base salary instead of 18 months' base salary in the event of his involuntary termination, whether or not in connection with a change in control; (2) instead of a payment of the full Short Term Plan Average, a payment of 50% of the Short Term Plan Average; and (3) in the event of death or disability, neither Mr. Anstice nor his estate will be entitled to any payment based on Mr. Anstice's base salary.
Maddock Agreement
The terms of the Maddock Agreement are substantively similar to those of the Anstice Agreement, with the following material differences:
The Maddock Agreement provides that Mr. Maddock shall serve as a Senior Vice President of the Company.
Under the Maddock Agreement, Mr. Maddock will receive a base salary of $440,000 ($385,000 per year while the Company's executive salary reduction program remains in effect), subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board.
Change in Control Agreements
The Change in Control Agreements provide that, if a "change in control" (as defined in the applicable Change in Control Agreement) of the Company occurs during the period of employment of the applicable executive officer under the Change in Control Agreement, and there is an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) of the executive officer's employment either in contemplation of or within the 12 months following such change in control, the executive officer will be entitled to payments and benefits substantively similar to those contained in the change of control provisions of the Anstice Agreement and the Maddock Agreement.
The Change in Control Agreements contain confidentiality, non-competition, and non-solicitation terms which are substantively similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, the Anstice Agreement and the Maddock Agreement.

Exhibit 10.1
Stephen G. Newberry Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Stephen G. Newberry (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company, which supersedes the Employment Agreement between the parties dated January 1, 2003 as amended December 17, 2008 (the "Original Agreement").
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's offices and positions.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30, 2012 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The Board will provide notice of its intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the Board provides notice of its intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
3. .
Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $800,000 ($660,000 while the executive salary reduction program in effect as of the date of this Agreement remains in effect). The independent members of the Board, at least annually, will review, and potentially adjust, such base salary on a prospective basis, reasonably taking into account Executive's performance and prevailing compensation for executives at similar levels in similar sized companies in the industry. Such salary shall be paid periodically in accordance with normal Company payroll. The annual compensation specified in this Section 3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Compensation."
Base Compensation
(b) . Executive shall be entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally (collectively, such plans are referred to in this Agreement as the "Combined Plans" and which are currently the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which includes the Multi-Year Incentive Plan and the equity components of the Long-Term Incentive Plan), subject to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determination of the independent members of the Board.
Variable Compensation
(c) . The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.
Deferred Compensation
(d) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the benefit plans and compensation programs maintained by the Company of general applicability to other executive officers of the Company, including (without limitation) retirement plans, savings or profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement or excess-benefit plans, stock option, life, disability, health, accident and other insurance programs, paid vacations (but accruing at not less than three weeks per year), and similar plans or programs, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan or program in question and to the determination of the independent members of the Board or the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan or program, as appropriate.
Benefits
(e) . The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
4. . Executive and the Company agree to use reasonable good faith efforts, to the extent reasonably practicable and not materially adverse to Executive, to structure payment of all amounts of Executive's compensation from the Company so as to avoid non-deductibility of any such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or any successor provision.
Section 162(m)
 
5. .
Benefits Upon a Change in Control
(a) If a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) occurs during the Employment Period, and an Involuntary Termination of Executive's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control
1
or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
2
, then:
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum equal to (A) eighteen (18) months of Base Compensation (without giving effect to any salary reduction program currently in effect), plus (B) an amount equal to the average of the short-term variable compensation plan (currently the Annual Incentive Plan, and for prior years the annual variable compensation plan called the "MBO", and together with any future short-term variable compensation plan, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Short Term Plan") payments earned by the Executive over the last five (5) years in which the Executive was employed with the Company on December 31
st
of such year (the "Five Year Average Amount"), plus (C) a pro-rata amount (based on the number of full months worked during the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs) of the Five Year Average Amount.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Company shall pay the Executive, not later than March 15th of the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the full amount he would have earned under such prior-year plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if his employment had not been terminated.
(iii) The Executive will receive the benefits he qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan, or if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Executive qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Executive prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date; the stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms, or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs within ten (10) days of the Termination Date.
 
 
 
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which currently would include two Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Executive, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal, for each performance cycle under each plan, the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
(ii) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Executive shall receive the Payment Amounts when it is ordinarily paid out. For avoidance of doubt, if there are multiple Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles, portions of the Payment Amounts may be paid in different years, each in accordance with the terms of the relevant performance cycle.
Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.
 
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).
i.e.
6. .
Severance Benefits other than in a Change in Control
(a) . In the event of any termination of Executive's employment at any time during the term of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall pay the Executive any unpaid Base Compensation due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (2) the Company shall pay the Executive all of the Executive's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (3) following submission of proper expense reports by the Executive (or his estate), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in connection with the business of the Company. These payments shall be made promptly at the Company's next scheduled payroll date.

(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Executive's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than: (A) any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally, or (B) unless in connection with a Change in Control, in which case this clause (B) shall not apply, any such reduction that is based on a good faith market review of executive compensation conditions and levels (for similar positions in comparable companies) conducted in accordance with the normal compensation evaluation process applicable to executive officers of the Company generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual Base Compensation (determined in the same manner as in Section 7(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits plus current annual target amounts under the Combined Plans, and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (FAS 123R) associated with that award;
 
(iv) the relocation of the Company's principal executive office to a location more than fifty (50) miles from its present location but only if the Executive is required to change his principal place of employment to such new location;
(v) any termination of the Executive's employment by or at the request of the Company other than for Cause, Disability or death;
(vi) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of this Agreement by any successors contemplated in Section 8 below; or
(vii) any material breach by the Company of any material provision of this Agreement;
subject to the following: (A) None of the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination if the Executive has agreed thereto. (B) The Board providing notice of its intent not to enter into, renew or extend this Agreement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof shall not be considered an Involuntary Termination (although any of the foregoing actions which occurs after the Board provides notice of its intent not to enter into, renew or extend this Agreement may constitute an Involuntary Termination). (C) Except with respect to an event described in Section 7(c)(v), the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination only if and to the extent that (x) within 90 days of the occurrence of the events giving rise to an Involuntary Termination, the Executive provides written notice to the Company setting forth in reasonable detail such facts which Executive believes constitute Involuntary Termination, (y) any circumstances constituting Involuntary Termination remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following the Company's receipt of such written notice, and (z) the Termination Date occurs within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the initial existence of the event giving rise to an Involuntary Termination.
(d) . "Termination Date" shall mean:
Termination Date
(i) In the case of a termination for Cause, the last day of the thirty (30) day notice period, unless the reason for such termination is cured by the Executive prior to the end of the thirty (30) day period;
(ii) In the case of a Company initiated Involuntary Termination (under Section 2(b)(i) of this Agreement), the last day of the ninety (90) day notice period required under such section, or such earlier date at which the Company waives notice and pays the Executive in lieu of such notice;
(iii) In the case of the Executive's Voluntary Resignation or of an Involuntary Termination initiated by the Executive (each under Section 2(b)(ii) of this Agreement), the last day of the applicable notice period required under such section, or such earlier date at which the Company waives notice and pays the Executive in lieu of such notice;
(iv) In the case of Executive's death, the date of such death; and
 
(v) In the case of Executive's Disability, the date of such Disability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Involuntary Termination occuring in contemplation of a Change in Control, if the Termination Date would otherwise have occurred prior to the Change in Control, the Termination Date shall take place on the date of the Change in Control. If more than one Termination Date may apply, then the priority provisions of Section 2(e) of this Agreement shall determine which Termination Date controls. The Company and the Executive shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.
(e) . "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:
Change in Control

(ii) A change in the composition of the Board occurring within a two-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" shall mean directors who either (A) are directors of the Company as of the effective date of this Agreement, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of the Incumbent Directors at the time of such election or nomination (but shall not include an individual whose election or nomination is in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors to the Company);
(iii) The stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior hereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company's assets (other than to a subsidiary or subsidiaries); or
(iv) Any other event as determined by the independent members of the Board, in the sole discretion of the independent members of the Board.
 
(f) . "Voluntary Resignation" shall mean Executive's termination of his employment at any time, for any reason, by the Executive, other than by reason of Involuntary Termination, death or Disability.

For all purposes under this Agreement, the term "Company" shall include any Successor Company which executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this subsection (a) or which becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law.

Notice
(a) . Notices and all other communications contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by Federal Express or a comparable air courier company. In the case of the Executive, notices sent by courier shall be addressed to him at the home address that he most recently communicated to the Company in writing. In the case of the Company, notices sent by courier shall be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to the attention of its Chief Legal Officer.

Any termination by the Company for Cause or by the Executive as a result of a Voluntary Resignation or any Involuntary Termination shall be communicated by a notice of termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 9(a) of this Agreement.

Notice of Termination
10.
Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 10 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.
 
(b) The Executive agrees that prior to the Termination Date, the Executive will not either directly or indirectly, whether as a director, officer, consultant, employee or advisor or in any other capacity (1) render any planning, marketing or other services respecting the creation, design, manufacture or sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and/or software to any business, agency, partnership or entity ("Restricted Business") other than the Company, or (2) make or hold any investment in any Restricted Business in the United States other than the Company, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than 2% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation. For purposes of this Section 10, the term "Company" shall mean and include the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, any Successor Company and any other corporation or entity of which the Executive may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or any Successor Company.
(c) Prior to the Termination Date, and for the period extending six (6) months thereafter, the Executive will not directly induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Company to leave its employ and join any Restricted Business in or within 50 miles of Fremont, California.
(d) The Executive agrees that the Company would suffer an irreparable injury if he were to breach the covenants contained in subparagraphs (b) or (c) and that the Company would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Executive hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
(e) If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 10 shall be deemed to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope or other provisions thereof, then the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provisions hereof (but only to the extent necessary to render such restrictions enforceable) and then enforce this Section 10 in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.
11. .
Existing Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreements
Executive represents and warrants (1) that prior to the date hereof he has provided the Company with true and complete copies of any and all written confidentiality and/or non-compete agreements to which Executive is a party as of the date hereof (together with a written description of any such oral agreements), and (2) to the best of Executive's knowledge, full compliance with the terms of each such agreement will not materially interfere with Executive's duties hereunder (except to the extent that Executive reasonably may determine to absent himself from certain Company meetings and communication during the first year of the Employment Period). The Executive further covenants that he will not willfully and knowingly fail to fully abide by the terms of any and all such agreements and will work in good faith with the Company to avoid any breach thereof.
 
12. .
Arbitration
At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
 
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Original Agreement shall be superseded by this Agreement effective July 1, 2009. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Whole Agreement; Amendment
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
 
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Exhibit 10.2
Martin B. Anstice Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Martin B. Anstice (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company.
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as an Executive Vice President and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's offices and positions.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30, 2012 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The CEO will provide notice of the Company's intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the CEO provides notice of the Company's intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
3. .
Compensation and Benefits

Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.

(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).

At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known.
 
The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments

Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate
 
payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Exhibit 10.3
Ernest E. Maddock Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Ernest E. Maddock (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company.
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as a Senior Vice President and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") and Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's offices and positions.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30, 2012 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The CEO will provide notice of the Company's intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the CEO provides notice of the Company's intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
3. .
Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $440,000 ($385,000 while the executive salary reduction program in effect as of the date of this Agreement remains in effect). The Compensation Committee, at least annually, will review, and potentially adjust, such base salary on a prospective basis, reasonably taking into account Executive's performance and prevailing compensation for executives at similar levels in similar sized companies in the industry. Such salary shall be paid periodically in accordance with normal Company payroll. The annual compensation specified in this Section 3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Compensation."
Base Compensation
(b) . Executive shall be entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally (collectively, such plans are referred to in this Agreement as the "Combined Plans" and which are currently the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which includes the Multi-Year Incentive Plan and the equity components of the Long-Term Incentive Plan), subject to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determination of the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan.
Variable Compensation
(c) . The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.
Deferred Compensation
(d) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the benefit plans and compensation programs maintained by the Company of general applicability to other executive officers of the Company, including (without limitation) retirement plans, savings or profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement or excess-benefit plans, stock option, life, disability, health, accident and other insurance programs, paid vacations (but accruing at not less than three weeks per year), and similar plans or programs, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan or program in question and to the determination of the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan or program.
Benefits
(e) . The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
4. . Executive and the Company agree to use reasonable good faith efforts, to the extent reasonably practicable and not materially adverse to Executive, to structure payment of all amounts of Executive's compensation from the Company so as to avoid non-deductibility of any such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or any successor provision.
Section 162(m)
 
5. .
Benefits Upon a Change in Control
(a) If a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) occurs during the Employment Period, and an Involuntary Termination of Executive's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control
1
or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
2
, then:
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum equal to (A) twelve (12) months of Base Compensation (without giving effect to any salary reduction program currently in effect), plus (B) an amount equal to the average of the short-term variable compensation plan (currently the Annual Incentive Plan, and for prior years the annual variable compensation plan called the "MBO", and together with any future short-term variable compensation plan, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Short Term Plan") payments earned by the Executive over the last five (5) years in which the Executive was employed with the Company on December 31
st
of such year (the "Five Year Average Amount"), plus (C) a pro-rata amount (based on the number of full months worked during the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs) of the Five Year Average Amount.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Company shall pay the Executive, not later than March 15
th
of the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the full amount he would have earned under such prior-year plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if his employment had not been terminated.
(iii) If the Executive qualifies for participation in the Company's Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, then the Executive will receive the benefits he qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan or, if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Executive qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
3
If the Executive does not qualify for participation in the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the
 
 
 
Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay in a lump sum any COBRA premiums the Executive would be required to pay for the COBRA benefits selected by Executive for twelve (12) months after the Executive's Termination Date.
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Executive prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date. Unless the grant was made prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. For options granted prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the grant's award agreement shall control its exercisability
4
. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs within ten (10) days of the Termination Date.
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which currently would include two Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Executive, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal, for each performance cycle under each plan, the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
(ii) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Executive shall receive the Payment Amounts when it is ordinarily paid out. For avoidance of doubt, if there are multiple Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles, portions of the Payment Amounts may be paid in different years, each in accordance with the terms of the relevant performance cycle.
Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of
 
 
 
Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).
i.e.
6. .
Severance Benefits other than in a Change in Control
(a) . In the event of any termination of Executive's employment at any time during the term of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall pay the Executive any unpaid Base Compensation due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (2) the Company shall pay the Executive all of the Executive's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (3) following submission of proper expense reports by the Executive (or his estate), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in connection with the business of the Company. These payments shall be made promptly at the Company's next scheduled payroll date.

(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Executive's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than: (A) any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally, or (B) unless in connection with a Change in Control, in which case this clause (B) shall not apply, any such reduction that is based on a good faith market review of executive compensation conditions and levels (for similar positions in comparable companies) conducted in accordance with the normal compensation evaluation process applicable to executive officers of the Company generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual Base Compensation (determined in the same manner as in Section 7(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits plus current annual target amounts under the Combined Plans, and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (FAS 123R) associated with that award;

Non-Compete; Non-Solicit
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 10 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.

The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties.

Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein.

Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate
 
payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

NAME
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement effective as of July 1, 2009.
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:
1. . If a Change in Control (as defined in Section 5(e) below) occurs during the term of this Agreement, and an Involuntary Termination of Executive's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control (as defined in Section 5(g) below) or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
Benefits Upon a Change in Control

, then:
(a) . Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date (as defined in Section 5(d) below), the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of Executive's base salary, as currently in effect (such amount to be computed without regard to any salary reduction program then in effect).
Base Salary
(b) .
Variable Compensation
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive an amount equal to the average of the short-term variable compensation plan (currently the Annual Incentive Plan, and for prior years the annual variable compensation plan called the "MBO", and together with any future short-term variable compensation plan, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Short Term Plan") payments earned by the Executive over the last five (5) years in which the Executive was employed with the Company on December 31
st
of such year (the "Five Year Average Amount")
2
;
(ii) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a pro-rata amount (based on the number of full months worked during the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs) of the Five Year Average Amount;
 
 
(iii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Company shall pay the Executive, not later than March 15
th
of the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the full amount Executive would have earned under such prior-year plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if Executive's employment had not been terminated.
(c) .
Medical Insurance
(i) If the Executive qualifies for participation in the Company's Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, then the Executive will receive the benefits Executive qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan, or if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Executive qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
(ii) If the Executive does not qualify for participation in the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay in a lump sum any COBRA premiums the Executive would be required to pay for the COBRA benefits selected by Executive for twelve (12) months after the Executive's Termination Date (eighteen (18) months for an Executive who has been employed with the Company for twenty (20) years or more as of the Termination Date).
(d) . The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Executive prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date. Unless the grant was made prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms, or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. For options granted prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the grant's award agreement shall control its exercisability
Equity Awards
3
. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs within ten (10) days of the Termination Date.
2. . In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which currently would include two Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Executive, subject to
Long-Term Cash Plan Awards
 
 
 
the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal, for each performance cycle under each plan, the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(a) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
(b) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Executive shall receive the Payment Amounts when it is ordinarily paid out. For avoidance of doubt, if there are multiple Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles, portions of the Payment Amounts may be paid in different years, each in accordance with the terms of the relevant performance cycle.
Change in Control, No Termination
3. . No Change in Control benefits under Sections 1 or 2 will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
Limitations
4. . If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.

(b) . "Disability" shall mean that the Executive is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reasons of any readily determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuing period of not less than twelve (12) months.

Disability
(c) . "Involuntary Termination" shall mean:
Involuntary Termination

"Termination Date" shall mean the last day of notice period required by Section 5(c) above, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice, in which case the earlier date at which the Company waives notice and pays the Executive in lieu of such notice shall be the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Involuntary Termination occuring in contemplation of a Change in Control, if the Termination Date would otherwise have occurred prior to the Change in Control, the Termination Date shall take place on the date of the Change in Control. The Company and the Executive shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.

Non-Compete; Non-Solicit
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique and that Executive's level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on Executive's part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 8 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.
(b) The Executive agrees that prior to the Termination Date, the Executive will not either directly or indirectly, whether as a director, officer, consultant, employee or advisor or in any other capacity (1) render any planning, marketing or other services respecting the creation, design, manufacture or sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and/or software to any business, agency, partnership or entity ("Restricted Business") other than the Company, or (2) make or hold any investment in any Restricted Business in the United States other than the Company, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than 2% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
10. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.

Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection 10(f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 10(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 10(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 10(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or
Section 409A of the Code
provided
 
before March 15
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . This Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (x) June 30, 2012, or (y) the date on which Executive's salary grade drops below X34, unless prior to the first such date to occur, the Company enters an Acquisition Agreement, in which case this Agreement shall remain in effect in connection with such Change in Control. Further, in the event that a reduction in Executive's salary grade occurs in contemplation of a Change in Control, this Agreement shall remain in effect in connection with that Change in Control.
Term
(l) . At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
Arbitration
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
 
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for Executive's reasonable attorney's fees to the extent Executive prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.

Adoption of Performance Goals For Second Half of Calendar Year 2009 under the Company's 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Programs
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established certain semi-annual performance factors for the second six-month period of calendar year 2009 under the Company's 2008/2009 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2008/2009 MYIP") and the Company's 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2009/2010 MYIP"), programs under the Company's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP"), for certain officers of the Company, including the Company's named executive officers.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 27, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., October 21, 2009Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the September 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 27, 2009. Revenue for the period was $318.5 million, gross margin was $136.8 million and net income was $16.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $217.8 million, gross margin of $67.8 million and net loss of $(88.5) million, or $(0.70) per diluted share, for the June 2009 quarter. Shipments for the September 2009 quarter were $355 million compared to $246 million during the June 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the September 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and the finalization of a portion of certain liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses. The Company's ongoing results for the June 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and asset impairments, a legal judgment, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, certain one-time contract termination costs, a net tax expense for valuation allowance, net tax expense on resolution of certain tax matters, and interest and legal fees related to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A tax expenses. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income (loss), ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income (loss), and ongoing net income (loss) per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $4.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the September 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net loss of $(57.0) million, or $(0.45) per diluted share, for the June 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the September 2009 quarter was $131.3 million or 41.2%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $67.8 million, or 31.1%, for the June 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory and field utilization as a result of increased business volume and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the September 2009 quarter increased to $123.3 million compared with the June 2009 quarter of $114.3 million. This increase was primarily the result of one-time credits against spending realized in the June 2009 quarter, planned additional spending on R&D programs and additional employee variable compensation as a result of higher profit levels.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the September 2009 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the September 2009 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $761.2 million at the end of the September 2009 quarter, compared to $757.8 million at the end of the June 2009 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $2.7 million during the September 2009 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the September 2009 quarter were $89.7 million and $55.6 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23 million as of September 27, 2009.
"Lam Research had strong shipments and revenue performance in the September quarter, allowing the Company to return to profitability and generate positive cash flow once again. As business conditions improve, we continue our focus on developing leading-edge solutions for our customers while responding rapidly to meet their current production needs," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "As we look forward to an improved business environment, we would like to thank our employees for their personal sacrifice during the downturn and their continued commitment to the success of Lam Research," Newberry concluded.

2.1
PLACE OF MEETINGS
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the Corporation.
2.2
ANNUAL MEETING
(a) An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the board of directors shall each year fix.
(b) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (1) pursuant to the corporation's proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (2) by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (3) by any stockholder of record of the corporation (the "Record Stockholder") at the time of the giving of the notice required in the following paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (3) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or propose business (other than business included in the corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (such act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) at an annual meeting of stockholders.

In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a Record Stockholder's notice.

2. as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
3. as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "party"):
(i) the name and address of each such party;
(ii)(A) the class, series, and number of shares of the corporation that are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by each such party, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by each such party, and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which either party has a right to vote, directly or indirectly, any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation held by each such party (for purposes of this Section 2.2(d), a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or
otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially directly or indirectly by each such party that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which either party is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that each such party is directly or indirectly entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of each such party's immediate family sharing the same household (which information set forth in this paragraph shall be supplemented by such stockholder or such beneficial owner, as the case may be, not later than ten (10) days after the record date for the meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date);
(iii) any other information relating to each such party that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and
(iv) a statement whether or not each such party will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation reasonably believed by the Record Stockholder or beneficial holder, as the case may be, to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by the Record Stockholder (such statement, a "Solicitation Statement").

Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) by any stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the secretary setting forth the information set forth in Section 2.2(d)(1) and 2.2(d)(3) of this Article II. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder of record's notice required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder of record's notice. A person shall not be eligible for election or reelection as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) by a stockholder of record in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Article II.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.3. Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
2.4
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS
All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6
QUORUM
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.8
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). Each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. The board of directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election (with abstentions and "broker non-votes" not counted as votes cast either for or against such nominee's election); provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders at which (i) the number of nominees for the board exceeds the number of open board seats; (ii) one or more nominees has been nominated pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees set forth in these bylaws or pursuant to the provisions of any future law, rule or regulation that require the Corporation to allow stockholder nominations in a manner other than that provided in these bylaws; and (iii) any such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting (other than director elections), unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
2.9
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.10
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
In the event of the delivery to the corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and any revocation thereof is referred to in this Section 2.10 as a "Consent"), the secretary of the corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consents and shall as soon as practicable thereafter conduct such reasonable investigation as he deems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the validity of such Consents and all matters incident thereto, including, without limitation, whether the holders of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consents have given consents. No consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be effective unless delivered to the corporation within sixty (60) days following the record date relating thereto fixed pursuant to this Section 2.10.
2.11
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
Except as otherwise permitted by law, in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
2.12
PROXIES
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual
signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, in the manner provided by law. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
2.14
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.
3.1
POWERS
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
3.2
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors then in office.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
3.3
ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless a stockholder demands election by written ballot at the meeting and before voting begins.
3.4
RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. When one or more directors so resigns, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies. When one or more directors resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date or upon the happening of a future event, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
A vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by a court order may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present, or by the unanimous written consent of all shares entitled to vote thereon. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor shall be elected and qualified.
3.5
PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE
The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
3.6
FIRST MEETINGS
The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place as shall be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for special meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
3.7
REGULAR MEETINGS
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice if the times of such meetings are fixed by the board of directors.
3.8
SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE
Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be given to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. Notice of such special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either (i) by mail not less than four (4) days before the date of the meeting, or (ii) personally, by telephone, telecopy, telegram, telex or other similar means of communication on twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director whom the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.
3.9
QUORUM
At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
3.10
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
3.11
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
3.12
BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
3.13
FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attending each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attending each meeting of the board of directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
3.14
APPROVAL OF LOANS TO OFFICERS
The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiaries who is not an "executive officer" (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or a director of the corporation, whenever in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.
3.15
REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.
3.16
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the board of directors, a chairman of the board of directors, who shall not be considered an officer of the corporation solely by reason of being appointed to such position.
4.1
COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS
The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in the bylaws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committees shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, fix any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation), (ii) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or (v) amend the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the board resolution establishing the committee, the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to section 253 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 27, 2009
FREMONT, Calif., January 27, 2010Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2009 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 27, 2009. Revenue for the period was $487.2 million, gross margin was $223.2 million and net income was $69.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $318.5 million, gross margin of $136.8 million and net income of $16.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the September 2009 quarter. Shipments for the December 2009 quarter were $519 million compared to $355 million during the September 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2009 quarter exclude certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities, the reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of the remaining liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses, and the impairment of an investment. The Company's ongoing results for the September 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities and the reversal of accrued liabilities due to settlement of a portion of certain liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $60.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share in the December 2009 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $4.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the September 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the December 2009 quarter was $218.5 million or 44.8%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $131.3 million, or 41.2%, for the September 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory utilization as a result of increased business volume and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the December 2009 quarter increased to $142.3 million compared with the September 2009 quarter of $123.3 million. This increase was a function of higher variable compensation expense associated with our improvement in profitability, new product material spending to support additional market opportunities arising from an improved business outlook, and the restoration of employee salaries and accompanying benefits (excluding executive management) to levels prior to the actions to reduce base compensation in the March 2009 quarter.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the December 2009 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2009 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $830.6 million at the end of the December 2009 quarter, compared to $761.2 million at the end of the September 2009 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $73.3 million during the December 2009 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the December 2009 quarter were $134.4 million and $73.9 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $11 million as of December 27, 2009.
"In the December 2009 quarter we saw significant growth in shipments, revenue and earnings for Lam Research. As we move into 2010 we will continue to focus on delivering market share gains in our etch and clean businesses to expand revenues, earnings per share and cash generation from cycle to cycle," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "I would like to thank our employees, suppliers and shareholders for their continued commitment to our success," Newberry concluded.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Adoption of Annual Incentive Program Performance Goals for Calendar Year 2010
The Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") established performance objectives for the first six months of its calendar year 2010 annual incentive program (the "2010 AIP"), a program under the Company's 2004 Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP") for Martin B. Anstice, Richard A. Gottscho, Abdi Hariri, and Ernest E. Maddock. A similar recommendation by the Committee with respect to Stephen G. Newberry was also approved by the independent members of the Board.
The 2010 AIP provides for the payment of performance-based compensation based on cash target amounts, which are established as a percentage of base salary paid. These cash target amounts will be earned at percentages ranging from 0% to 100% of the maximum award depending on the level of ongoing operating profit as a percentage of revenue that the Company achieves. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to reduce the amounts of such awards and will base such determinations on metrics related to both corporate performance (including ongoing operating profit as a percentage of revenue) and organizational performance (including market share, new market and new product revenue, gross margin, cash from operations, organizational financial performance, business process improvement, and product development).
Awards under the 2010 AIP will be delivered in cash. The maximum amount payable to an executive under the AIP is 225% of the target opportunity. The target opportunities, as a percentage of the participant's 2010 base salary paid, are: Mr. Newberry, 150%; Mr. Anstice, 85%; Mr. Maddock, 80%; Dr. Gottscho, 80%; and Mr. Hariri, 75%.
Adoption of Performance Goals for First Half of Calendar Year 2010 under the Company's 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Program
The Committee established performance factors for the first six months of 2010 under the Company's 2009/2010 Multi-Year Incentive Program (the "2009/2010 MYIP") for Mr. Anstice, Dr. Gottscho, Mr. Hariri, and Mr. Maddock. A similar recommendation by the Committee with respect to Mr. Newberry was also approved by the independent members of the Board. The 2009/2010 MYIP is the cash component of the 2009/2010 Long-Term Incentive Program (the "2009/2010 LTIP"). Target and maximum award opportunities for the 2009/2010 MYIP were established when the 2009/2010 LTIP was adopted in February 2009 and no changes have been made to those targets or maximums. For the first six months of 2010, the performance factor is calculated utilizing ongoing operating profitability. Consistent with prior years' programs, the award resulting from achievement of this factor may be enhanced by a stock price performance multiplier if the Company's stock price increases above a specified baseline price. Actual payouts may vary from 0 to 2.5 times target amounts depending on achievement of the performance factor and the stock price. Awards will vest, to the extent earned, and will be paid in cash in 2011.
Adoption of Target Amounts, and Performance Goals for the First Half of Calendar Year 2010, under the Company's 2010/2011 Long-Term Incentive Program
The Committee also set 2010 target amounts and maximum award opportunities under the 2010/2011 Long-Term Incentive Program (the "2010/2011 LTIP") for Mr. Anstice, Dr. Gottscho, Mr. Hariri and Mr. Maddock. A similar recommendation by the Committee with respect to Mr. Newberry was approved by the independent members of the Board. For Messrs. Newberry, Anstice, Gottscho, Hariri and Maddock, the target amounts under the 2010/2011 LTIP were set at $4,500,000, $2,000,000, $1,350,000, $1,250,000 and $1,600,000, respectively.
The 2010/2011 LTIP has two components: (1) a cash component pursuant to the 2010/2011 MYIP; and (2) an equity component (the "2010/2011 Long-Term Equity Component") governed by the Company's 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the 2010/2011 LTIP, one-half of the target value is allocated to the 2010/2011 MYIP and the other half to the 2010/2011 Long-Term Equity Component.
The performance factor for the first six months of 2010 under the cash component pursuant to the 2010/2011 MYIP is the same as under the 2009/2010 MYIP: ongoing operating profitability. The award resulting from achievement of this factor may be enhanced by the same stock price performance multiplier adopted for the 2010 year of the 2009/2010 MYIP. Actual payouts may vary from 0 to 2.5 times target amounts depending on achievement of the performance factor and the stock price. Accruals under the 2010/2011 MYIP will be based on the Company's performance during calendar years 2010 and 2011. Awards will vest, to the extent earned, and be paid in cash in 2012.
Under the 2010/2011 Long-Term Equity Component, 50% of the component is delivered in restricted stock units ("RSUs") with time-based vesting and 50% is delivered in RSUs with performance-contingent vesting. On February 5, 2010, each named executive officer received a grant of RSUs with time-based vesting and a grant of RSUs with performance-contingent vesting. The number of RSUs with time-based vesting granted equals one-half of the target amount allocated to the 2010/2011 Long-Term Equity Component divided by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. Each named executive officer also was granted an RSU with performance-contingent vesting for the same number of shares. The RSUs with time-based vesting will vest on the second anniversary of the grant date so long as the executive remains employed by the Company through the vest date. The RSUs with performance-contingent vesting will vest on the second
Table of Contents
anniversary of the grant date based on an ongoing operating profitability factor. From 0% to 100% of the shares will vest, depending on the level of ongoing operating profit percentage achieved during the four highest-performing quarters of calendar years 2010 and 2011.
Grant of Awards and Adoption of Vesting Conditions under Global Product Group Key Incentive Program
Dr. Gottscho also participates in the Global Product Group Key Incentive Program. The purpose of this program is to motivate critical technical talent to achieve key long-term performance objectives relating to factors such as penetration of new markets and new product development. On February 1, 2010, the Committee approved a grant of 28,000 RSUs to Dr. Gottscho, which will be made on February 5, 2010, with both performance-based and time-based vesting elements. In order for the RSUs to vest, certain goals with respect to company-wide market share and product line market share must be achieved and Dr. Gottscho must be employed by the Company through the vesting date.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 28, 2010
FREMONT, Calif., April 21, 2010Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2010 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 28, 2010. Revenue for the period was $632.8 million, gross margin was $292.9 million and net income was $120.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $487.2 million, gross margin of $223.2 million and net income of $69.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the December 2009 quarter. Shipments for the March 2010 quarter were $735 million compared to $519 million during the December 2009 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2009 quarter excluded certain costs for previously announced restructuring activities, the reversal of accrued liabilities due to final settlement of the remaining liabilities for Internal Revenue Code Section 409A related expenses, and the impairment of an investment. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine "ongoing" results for the March 2010 quarter. Management uses the presentation of ongoing gross margin, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site.
Ongoing net income was $120.3 million, or $0.94 per diluted share in the March 2010 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $60.7 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the December 2009 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2010 quarter was $292.9 million or 46.3%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $218.5 million, or 44.8%, for the December 2009 quarter. The sequential increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved factory utilization as a result of increased business volume and a more favorable product mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the March 2010 quarter remained essentially flat compared with the December 2009 quarter.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the March 2010 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2010 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $843.8 million at the end of the March 2010 quarter, compared to $830.6 million at the end of the December 2009 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $109.3 million during the March 2010 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the March 2010 quarter were $238.4 million and $138.2 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23 million as of March 28, 2010.
"Shipments for the March 2010 quarter represented an all-time high for Lam Research reflecting market share gains in both our etch and clean businesses, supported by strong operational performance of the factory and supply chain," said Steve Newberry, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "The continued success of the spin-clean business, evidenced by the recent shipment of our 3,000
th
spin-clean process chamber, is complemented by our linear-clean and plasma-based bevel clean technologies. Our clean products represent a technology and productivity leadership portfolio that is advancing the success of our adjacent-market growth strategy," Newberry concluded.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 26, 2010
FREMONT, Calif., January 26, 2011Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2010 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 26, 2010. Revenue for the period was $870.7 million, gross margin was $407.4 million (46.8%), and net income was $221.9 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $805.9 million, gross margin of $377.3 million (46.8%), and net income of $193.7 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, for the September 2010 quarter. Shipments for the December 2010 quarter were $892 million compared to $808 million during the September 2010 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2010 quarter exclude certain benefits for research and development tax credits. The Company's ongoing results for the September 2010 quarter exclude certain benefits for restructuring activities and asset impairments. Management uses the presentation of ongoing operating income, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing net income, ongoing operating income, ongoing operating expenses, and ongoing operating margin results to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamrc.com.
Ongoing net income was $217.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share in the December 2010 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $190.6 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, for the September 2010 quarter. Ongoing operating expenses for the December 2010 quarter were $166.3 million compared with the September 2010 quarter of $158.5 million. This change is primarily due to increased research and development activities and enhanced levels of sales and marketing expense associated with customer joint development projects.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the December 2010 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2010 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.2 billion at the end of the December 2010 quarter, compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the September 2010 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $185.6 million during the December 2010 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the December 2010 quarter were $222.9 million and $135.1 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $47.7 million as of December 26, 2010.
"Lam delivered record shipments, revenues and earnings per share for the December quarter. In calendar year 2010, our system shipments grew by nearly 200%, significantly outperforming the 120% growth in wafer fab equipment spending and leading to record levels of revenue and earnings at $3 billion and $5.35 per share respectively," stated Steve Newberry, chief executive officer and vice chairman of the board. "Our performance reflects the strong market share gains we achieved in 2010 across both etch and clean product lines. Looking ahead, we are focused on further strengthening our market positions by increasing our investments in field-based customer technology and productivity solutions, as well as core R&D programs targeted at meeting our customers' future technology needs."

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 27, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., April 20, 2011Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 27, 2011. Revenue for the period was $809.1 million, gross margin was $374.0 million (46.2%), and net income was $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $870.7 million, gross margin of $407.4 million (46.8%), and net income of $221.9 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, for the December 2010 quarter. Shipments for the March 2011 quarter were $813 million compared to $892 million during the December 2010 quarter.
The Company's ongoing results for the December 2010 quarter exclude certain benefits for research and development tax credits. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine "ongoing" results for the March 2011 quarter. Management uses ongoing operating income, ongoing operating expenses, ongoing operating margin, ongoing net income, and ongoing net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of ongoing results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investor's ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. A table presenting a reconciliation of ongoing net income to results under U.S. GAAP is included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamrc.com.
Ongoing net income was $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share in the March 2011 quarter compared to ongoing net income of $217.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, for the December 2010 quarter. Ongoing gross margin for the March 2011 quarter was $374.0 million or 46.2%, compared to ongoing gross margin of $407.4 million, or 46.8%, for the December 2010 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to customer mix. Ongoing operating expenses for the March 2011 quarter were $177.0 million compared with the December 2010 quarter of $166.3 million. This change is consistent with our plans to increase investments in core product research and development as well as customer-specific programs.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the March 2011 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $1.4 billion at the end of the March 2011 quarter, compared to $1.2 billion at the end of the December 2010 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $241.6 million during the March 2011 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the March 2011 quarter were $246.6 million and $150.3 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $36.2 million as of March 27, 2011.
"Lam delivered strong performance in the March quarter providing a solid foundation for the remainder of 2011. I am particularly pleased with our solid cash generation performance, which represented a return of approximately 30% of revenues. Strong demand for smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices is expected to drive a healthy level of investment on the part of our customers over the course of CY'11," said Steve Newberry, chief executive officer and vice chairman of the board.
"These investment levels create opportunities for Lam, and we remain committed to making the strategic investments necessary to strengthen and grow our market position in both etch and clean. We have increased our level of customer engagement through joint partnerships and programs designed to improve our customers' manufacturing productivity and address their most complex technical challenges. These customer-centric programs coupled with investments in core product R&D enable Lam Research to be well-positioned for growth in the coming years."

On May 5, 2011, Lam Research Corporation issued a press release announcing that it proposes to offer $700 million of convertible senior notes, subject to market conditions and other factors. The notes would be issued in two tranches of $350 million each due in May 2016 and May 2018, respectively, and are to be offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes will be convertible, upon certain conditions, into cash up to their principal amount and, with respect to any excess conversion value, shares of Lam Research common stock. The interest rate, conversion rate, offering price and other terms will be determined by negotiations between the Company and the initial purchasers of the notes. The Company also expects to grant to the initial purchasers the right to purchase an additional $50 million of each tranche to cover over-allotments.
Lam Research intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase, depending on interest, a minimum of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock and may repurchase up to 3,000,000 shares of its common stock from purchasers of notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers. The price of the common stock repurchased in such transactions is expected to equal the closing price per share of its common stock on the date of the pricing of the offering. This activity could affect the market price of Lam Research common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. In addition, following this offering Lam Research may from time to time repurchase additional shares of common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase program. Any future repurchases could affect the market price of Lam Research common stock or the notes.
In connection with the pricing of the notes, Lam Research also expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates. Lam Research intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions (taking into account the proceeds to it from the sale of the warrants). If the initial purchasers exercise their over-allotment option with respect to a series of notes, Lam Research expects to sell additional warrants and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes, together with the proceeds from the additional warrants, to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions.
The balance of the net proceeds of the offering is intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. Lam Research may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire other businesses, products or technologies, or to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. The Company does not have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisition at this time.
A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

LAM RESEARCH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO OFFER $700 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES

FREMONT, Calif., May 5  Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that it proposes to offer $700 million of convertible senior notes, subject to market conditions and other factors. The notes would be issued in two tranches of $350 million each due in May 2016 and May 2018, respectively, and are to be offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The notes will be convertible, upon certain conditions, into cash up to their principal amount and, with respect to any excess conversion value, shares of Lam Research common stock. The interest rate, conversion rate, offering price and other terms will be determined by negotiations between the company and the initial purchasers of the notes. The company also expects to grant to the initial purchasers the right to purchase an additional $50 million of each tranche to cover over-allotments.
Lam Research intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase, depending on interest, a minimum of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock and may repurchase up to 3,000,000 shares of its common stock from purchasers of notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers. The price of the common stock repurchased in such transactions is expected to equal the closing price per share of its common stock on the date of the pricing of the offering. This activity could affect the market price of Lam Research common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. In addition, following this offering Lam Research may from time to time repurchase additional shares of common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Any future repurchases could affect the market price of Lam Research common stock or the notes.
In connection with the pricing of the notes, Lam Research also expects to enter into privately negotiated convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates. Lam Research intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions (taking into account the proceeds to it from the sale of the warrants). If the initial purchasers exercise their over-allotment option with respect to a series of notes, Lam Research expects to sell additional warrants and use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the additional notes, together with the proceeds from the additional warrants, to enter into additional convertible note hedge transactions.
The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to shares of Lam Research common stock upon any conversion of the notes; however, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect with respect to Lam Research common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Lam Research common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. In connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the initial purchasers or their affiliates that will be parties to those transactions have advised Lam Research that they expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to Lam Research common stock. This activity
could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of Lam Research common stock or the notes above market levels that would have prevailed or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of Lam Research common stock or the notes. In addition, the initial purchasers or their affiliates that are parties to those transactions have advised Lam Research that they may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Lam Research common stock and/or purchasing or selling of Lam Research common stock in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Lam Research common stock or the notes, which could affect holders' ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to the notes, it could affect the number of shares and value of the consideration that holders will receive upon conversion of the notes.
The balance of the net proceeds of the offering is intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. Lam Research may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire other businesses, products or technologies, or to repurchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. The company does not have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisition at this time.
This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any of these securities. Any offers of the notes will be made only by means of a confidential offering memorandum. The notes, the convertible note hedge transactions, the warrants and the shares of Lam Research common stock underlying these securities have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Item 8.01 Other Items.
On May 6, 2011, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the pricing of its private offering of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, an increase from the $700 million in aggregate principal amount previously announced. The notes will be issued in two tranches of $375 million each (an increase from $350 million each) due in May 2016 (the "2016 Notes") and May 2018 (the "2018 Notes," and together with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes"), respectively, and will be sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 2016 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year, and the 2018 Notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per year, in each case, payable semi-annually. The Notes will each be convertible into cash and shares, if any, of the Company's common stock. The conversion rate for each of the 2016 Notes and the 2018 Notes will initially be 15.8687 shares per $1,000 principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 32.5% to the $47.56 per share closing price of the Company's common stock on May 5, 2011. The Notes will be convertible prior to February 15, 2016 in the case of the 2016 Notes and prior to February 15, 2018 in the case of the 2018 Notes, only upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, and will be convertible thereafter regardless of these circumstances. Upon conversion of the Notes, holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each Note converted, and any excess conversion value above the principal amount of the Note will be delivered in shares of the Company's common stock. The Company has granted to the initial purchasers the right to purchase an additional $75 million (an increase from $50 million) in aggregate principal amount of each tranche to cover over-allotments.
The sale of the Notes is expected to close on May 11, 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.
The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $735,500,000, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
The Company intends to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase approximately 1,000,000 shares of its common stock from purchasers of Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers. The price of the common stock repurchased in such transactions will be $47.56 per share, the closing price of the Company's common stock on May 5, 2011. This activity could affect the market price of the Company's common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the Notes. In addition, following this offering the Company may from time to time repurchase additional shares of common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase program. Any future repurchases could affect the market price of the Company's common stock or the Notes.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 11, 2011, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") completed the private offering of $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0.50% convertible notes due 2016 (the "2016 Notes"), including the simultaneous closing of the full exercise on May 9, 2011 by the initial purchasers of the overallotment option with respect thereto, and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes," and collectively with the 2016 Notes, the "Notes"), including the simultaneous closing of the full exercise on May 9, 2011 by the initial purchasers of the overallotment option with respect thereto.
The net proceeds from this offering, including net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option, were approximately $835,600,000, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts, the estimated offering expenses and the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, after taking into account the proceeds from the warrant transactions. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, after taking into account the proceeds from the separate warrant transactions described below, was approximately $47.3 million.
The 2016 Notes were issued under an indenture governing the 2016 Notes (the "2016 Indenture") and the 2018 Notes were issued under an indenture governing the 2018 Notes (the "2018 Indenture," and together with the 2016 Indenture, the "Indentures"), in each case with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
The 2016 Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 0.50% and the 2018 Notes will bear interest at an annual rate of 1.25%, in each case from May 11, 2011 or from the most recent date on which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2011. The 2016 Notes will mature on May 15, 2016, and the 2018 Notes will mature on May 15, 2018, unless earlier converted or repurchased. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.
The Notes are convertible, in certain circumstances, into shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company common stock"). Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the principal amount of the Notes to be converted and deliver shares of Company common stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the principal amount of the Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 15.8687 shares of Company common stock per $1,000

principal amount of Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $63.02 per share of Company common stock, subject to adjustment.
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes on or after February 15, 2016 (in the case of the 2016 Notes) and February 15, 2018 (in the case of the 2018 Notes) until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the relevant series of Notes. Prior to February 15, 2016 (in the case of the 2016 Notes) and February 15, 2018 (in the case of the 2018 Notes), holders may convert their Notes under any of the following conditions:
 
 
 
Holders of the Notes who convert their Notes in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the Indentures, may be entitled to a make-whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally, in the event of a fundamental change that occurs prior to the maturity of a series of Notes, the holders of those Notes may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their Notes for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The Indentures contain customary events of default with respect to the Notes, including that upon certain events of default (including failure to timely pay principal or interest) occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of an outstanding series of Notes may declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all of such series of Notes to be due and payable.
The above description of the Indentures and the Notes is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Indentures, filed as Exhibits 4.1 and 4.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

The information provided in response to Item 1.01 or this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference in this Item 3.02.
On May 5, 2011, and May 10, 2011, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions with one of the initial purchasers of the Notes and an affiliate of the other initial purchaser of the Notes (the "hedge counterparties"), in order to limit potential dilution from conversion of the Notes in the event the market price per share of the Company common stock, as measured under the terms of the convertible note hedge

transactions, is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Notes.
Also on May 5, 2011 and May 10, 2011, the Company sold warrants to acquire, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, Company common stock to the hedge counterparties in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. If the market price of the Company common stock at the time of exercise of the applicable warrants exceeds the strike price of those warrants, the Company will owe the hedge counterparties net shares of Company common stock in an amount based on the excess of the then current market price of the Company common stock over the strike price of the applicable warrants. The warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price of Company common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. If the market value of the Company's common stock upon exercise of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants, the dilution mitigation under the convertible note hedge transactions described above will be capped, which means that there would be dilution from conversion of the Notes to the extent the then market value per share of Company common stock, as measured under the applicable warrant transactions, exceeds the strike price of those warrants at the time of settlement.
The Notes and the underlying Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, or upon exercise of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, have not been registered under the Securities Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The Notes were offered and sold only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
As a result of the obligations under the Notes upon conversion being payable in cash as described above, the number of shares of Company common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes may constitute less than 1% of the number of shares outstanding of the Company common stock.
Item 8.01 Other Items.
The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repurchase 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock pursuant to an agreement with one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate at a purchase price of $47.56 per share. This activity could affect the market price of the Company's common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the Notes. In addition, following this offering the Company may from time to time repurchase additional shares of common stock pursuant to its stock repurchase program. Any future repurchases could affect the market price of the Company's common stock or the Notes.

The Trustee (and if different, the Conversion Agent) shall notify the Company of any conversion pursuant to this Article 14 on the Conversion Date for such conversion. No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 15.03.
Notice of Conversion
If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(c) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in subsection (b) above.

payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge required by law or that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such conversion being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such conversion.
(e) If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion, unless the tax is due because the Holder requests such shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name, in which case the Holder shall pay that tax. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(f) Except as provided in Section 14.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article 14.

(h) Upon conversion, a Holder shall not receive any separate cash payment for accrued and unpaid interest, if any, except as set forth below. The Company's settlement of the Conversion Obligation shall be deemed to satisfy in full its obligation to pay the principal amount of the Note and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date. As a result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes, accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid first out of the cash paid upon such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date, Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on such Regular Record Date will receive the full amount of interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes so converted; that no such payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (3) to the extent of any Defaulted Amounts, if any Defaulted Amounts exist at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.
provided
(i) The Person in whose name the certificate for any shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record as of the close of business on the last Trading Day of the related Observation Period. Upon a conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for conversion.
 
(j) The Company shall not issue any fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion based on the Daily VWAP on the Last Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period. For each Note surrendered for conversion, the full number of shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Observation Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation shall be paid in cash.
Section 14.03 (a) If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall, under the circumstances described below, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described below.

In such event, the Conversion Obligation shall be paid to Holders in cash on the third Business Day following the Conversion Date. The Company shall notify the Holders of Notes of the Effective Date of any Make-Whole Fundamental Change and issue a press release announcing such Effective Date no later than five Business Days after such Effective Date (the "").

If the holders of the Common Stock receive only cash in a Make-Whole Fundamental Change described in clause (b) of the definition of Fundamental Change, the Stock Price shall be the cash amount paid per share.

(i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table above or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the earlier and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(ii) if the Stock Price is greater than $180.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate; and
(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $47.56 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 21.0261 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04.
(f) Nothing in this Section 14.03 shall prevent an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04 in respect of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
Section 14.04 The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company if any of the following events occurs, except that the Company shall not make any adjustments to the Conversion Rate if Holders of the Notes participate (other than in the case of a share split or share combination), at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock and solely as a result of holding the Notes, in any of the transactions described in this Section 14.04, without having to convert their Notes, as if they held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate, the principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder.

(a) If the Company exclusively issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of its Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 14.04(a) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b) If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than 60 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any increase made under this Section 14.04(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance had not occurred.
For purposes of this Section 14.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the
 
Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (i) dividends, distributions or issuances as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) or Section 14.04(e), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(d), and (iii) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 14.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities of the Company, the ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
where,
 
Any increase made under the portion of this Section 14.04(c) above shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock receive the Distributed Property, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 14.04(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the
 
Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where,
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall occur on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period; that in respect of any conversion during the Valuation Period, references in the portion of this Section 14.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate.
provided
For purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and subject in all respect to Section 14.11), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon

such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 14.04(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) and this Section 14.04(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 14.04(c) is applicable that also includes one or both of:
(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 14.04(a) is applicable (the ""); or
Clause A Distribution
(B) a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 14.04(b) is applicable (the ""),

Clause C Distribution
 
effective date" within the meaning of Section 14.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of Section 14.04(b).
(d) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any increase pursuant to this Section 14.04(d) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of the Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution.
(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
where,
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(e) shall occur at the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this Section 14.04(e) with respect to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the date that such tender or exchange offer expires and the Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate.
provided
(f) If the application of the formulas in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 14.04 would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made (other than as a result of a reverse share split or share combination). In no event will the Company adjust the Conversion Rate to the extent that the adjustment would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value per share of the Common Stock.
(g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
 
(h) In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 14.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to either of the preceding two sentences, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 14, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;
(iii) upon the issuance of any shares of the Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security not described in clause (ii) of this subsection and outstanding as of the date the Notes were first issued;
(iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
(v) for accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
(j) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 14 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
(k) The Company will not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Company will carry forward any adjustment that is less than 1% of the Conversion Rate, take such carriedforward adjustments into account in any subsequent adjustment, and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) annually on the anniversary of the first date of issue of the Notes and otherwise and (ii)(x) on the Conversion Date for any Notes or (y) on the effective date of any Fundamental Change or Make-Whole Fundamental Change, unless such adjustment has already been made.
 
(l) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent if not the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at its last address appearing on the Note Register of this Indenture.

(the ""), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Conversion Agent, the Company and the Holders of the Notes. Additional Notes may be issued in an unlimited aggregate principal amount, subject to certain conditions specified in the Indenture.
Notes
Indenture
Trustee
In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal of, and interest on, all Notes may be declared, by either the Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, and upon said declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions and certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and the principal amount on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the Holder who surrenders a Note to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, and in certain other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as described therein. It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal (including the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, if applicable) of and accrued and unpaid interest on this Note at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the lawful money herein prescribed.
The Notes are issuable in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral multiples thereof. At the office or agency of the Company referred to on the face hereof, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture,
 
Notes may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other authorized denominations, without payment of any service charge but, if required by the Company or Trustee, with payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer or similar tax that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such exchange of Notes being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such exchange.

No Notice of Conversion with respect to any Notes may be surrendered by a Holder thereof if such Holder has also delivered a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice to the Company in respect of such Notes and not validly withdrawn such Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in accordance with Section 15.03.
Notice of Conversion
If more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the Conversion Obligation with respect to such Notes shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted thereby) so surrendered.
(c) A Note shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the close of business on the date (the "") that the Holder has complied with the requirements set forth in subsection (b) above.

payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge required by law or that may be imposed in connection therewith as a result of the name of the Holder of the new Notes issued upon such conversion being different from the name of the Holder of the old Notes surrendered for such conversion.
(e) If a Holder submits a Note for conversion, the Company shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax due on the issue of any shares of Common Stock upon conversion, unless the tax is due because the Holder requests such shares to be issued in a name other than the Holder's name, in which case the Holder shall pay that tax. The Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock being issued in a name other than the Holder's name until the Trustee receives a sum sufficient to pay any tax that is due by such Holder in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
(f) Except as provided in Section 14.04, no adjustment shall be made for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of any Note as provided in this Article 14.

As a result, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the Conversion Date shall be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. Upon a conversion of Notes, accrued and unpaid interest will be deemed to be paid first out of the cash paid upon such conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Notes are converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date, Holders of such Notes as of the close of business on such Regular Record Date will receive the full amount of interest payable on such Notes on the corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion. Notes surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to the open of business on the immediately following Interest Payment Date must be accompanied by funds equal to the amount of interest payable on the Notes so converted; that no such payment shall be required (1) for conversions following the Regular Record Date immediately preceding the Maturity Date; (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the corresponding Interest Payment Date; or (3) to the extent of any Defaulted Amounts, if any Defaulted Amounts exist at the time of conversion with respect to such Note.
provided

Upon a conversion of Notes, such Person shall no longer be a Holder of such Notes surrendered for conversion.
 
(j) The Company shall not issue any fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes and shall instead pay cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock issuable upon conversion based on the Daily VWAP on the Last Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period. For each Note surrendered for conversion, the full number of shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate Daily Settlement Amounts for the applicable Observation Period and any fractional shares remaining after such computation shall be paid in cash.
Section 14.03 (a) If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs and a Holder elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change, the Company shall, under the circumstances described below, increase the Conversion Rate for the Notes so surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of Common Stock (the ""), as described below.

In such event, the Conversion Obligation shall be paid to Holders in cash on the third Business Day following the Conversion Date. The Company shall notify the Holders of Notes of the Effective Date of any Make-Whole Fundamental Change and issue a press release announcing such Effective Date no later than five Business Days after such Effective Date (the "").

The exact Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case:
(i) if the Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table above or the Effective Date is between two Effective Dates in the table, the number of Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices and the earlier and later Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year;
(ii) if the Stock Price is greater than $190.00 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate; and
(iii) if the Stock Price is less than $47.56 per share (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above pursuant to subsection (d) above), no Additional Shares shall be added to the Conversion Rate.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 21.0261 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 14.04.

(a) If the Company exclusively issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of its Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
 
 
Any adjustment made under this Section 14.04(a) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately after the open of business on the effective date for such share split or share combination, as applicable. If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this Section 14.04(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.
 
(b) If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock any rights, options or warrants entitling them, for a period of not more than 60 calendar days after the announcement date of such issuance, to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
Any increase made under this Section 14.04(b) shall be made successively whenever any such rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance. To the extent that shares of the Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase with respect to the issuance of such rights, options or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such Ex-Dividend Date for such issuance had not occurred.
For purposes of this Section 14.04(b), in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock at less than such average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of announcement for such issuance, and in determining the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any consideration received by the
 
Company for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors.
(c) If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire its Capital Stock or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding (i) dividends, distributions or issuances as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) or Section 14.04(e), (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash as to which an adjustment was effected pursuant to Section 14.04(d), and (iii) Spin-Offs as to which the provisions set forth below in this Section 14.04(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, other assets or property or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities of the Company, the ""), then the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Distributed Property
 
where,
 
Any increase made under the portion of this Section 14.04(c) above shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. If such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "FMV" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount thereof, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of the Common Stock receive the Distributed Property, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the "FMV" (as defined above) of any distribution for purposes of this Section 14.04(c) by reference to the actual or when-issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the
 
Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution.
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.04(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company, that are, or, when issued, will be, listed or admitted for trading on a U.S. national securities exchange (a ""), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
Spin-Off
 
where,
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under the preceding paragraph shall occur on the last Trading Day of the Valuation Period; that in respect of any conversion during the Valuation Period, references in the portion of this Section 14.04(c) related to Spin-Offs to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed to be replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the Ex-Dividend Date of such Spin-Off and the Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate.

For purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and subject in all respect to Section 14.11), rights, options or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's Capital Stock, including Common Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights, options or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (""): (i) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of the Common Stock; (ii) are not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of the Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 14.04(c) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event, whereupon

such rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made under this Section 14.04(c). If any such right, option or warrant, including any such existing rights, options or warrants distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights, options or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Ex-Dividend Date with respect to new rights, options or warrants with such rights (in which case the existing rights, options or warrants shall be deemed to terminate and expire on such date without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights, options or warrants, or any Trigger Event or other event (of the type described in the immediately preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights, options or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or purchased without exercise by any holders thereof, upon such final redemption or purchase (x) the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options or warrants had not been issued and (y) the Conversion Rate shall then again be readjusted to give effect to such distribution, deemed distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or purchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights, options or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights, options or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or purchase, and (2) in the case of such rights, options or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights, options and warrants had not been issued.
For purposes of Section 14.04(a), Section 14.04(b) and this Section 14.04(c), any dividend or distribution to which this Section 14.04(c) is applicable that also includes one or both of:
(A) a dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock to which Section 14.04(a) is applicable (the ""); or
Clause A Distribution
(B) a dividend or distribution of rights, options or warrants to which Section 14.04(b) is applicable (the ""),

Clause C Distribution
 
effective date" within the meaning of Section 14.04(a) or "outstanding immediately prior to the open of business on such Ex-Dividend Date" within the meaning of Section 14.04(b).
(d) If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
 
 
Any increase pursuant to this Section 14.04(d) shall become effective immediately after the open of business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid, the Conversion Rate shall be decreased, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to make or pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if "C" (as defined above) is equal to or greater than "SP
0
" (as defined above), in lieu of the foregoing increase, each Holder of a Note shall receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of shares of the Common Stock, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Ex-Dividend Date for such cash dividend or distribution.
(e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries make a payment in respect of a tender or exchange offer for the Common Stock, to the extent that the cash and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the Common Stock exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula:
 
where,
 
 
 
 
 
 
The adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 14.04(e) shall occur at the close of business on the 10th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange offer expires; that in respect of any conversion within the 10 Trading Days immediately following, and including, the expiration date of any tender or exchange offer, references in this Section 14.04(e) with respect to 10 Trading Days shall be deemed replaced with such lesser number of Trading Days as have elapsed between the date that such tender or exchange offer expires and the Conversion Date in determining the Conversion Rate.
provided
(f) If the application of the formulas in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 14.04 would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be made (other than as a result of a reverse share split or share combination). In no event will the Company adjust the Conversion Rate to the extent that the adjustment would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value per share of the Common Stock.
(g) Except as stated herein, the Company shall not adjust the Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of its Common Stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its Common Stock or the right to purchase shares of its Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable securities.
 
(h) In addition to those adjustments required by clauses (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 14.04, and to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to the applicable rules of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company from time to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the Company's best interest. In addition, the Company may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) or similar event. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to either of the preceding two sentences, the Company shall mail to the Holder of each Note at its last address appearing on the Note Register a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 14, the Conversion Rate shall not be adjusted:
(i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company's securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;
(ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase those shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries;

(iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
(v) for accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
(j) All calculations and other determinations under this Article 14 shall be made by the Company and shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share.
(k) The Company will not be required to make an adjustment in the Conversion Rate unless the adjustment would require a change of at least 1% in the Conversion Rate. However, the Company will carry forward any adjustment that is less than 1% of the Conversion Rate, take such carriedforward adjustments into account in any subsequent adjustment, and make such carried forward adjustments, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1%, (i) annually on the anniversary of the first date of issue of the Notes and otherwise and (ii)(x) on the Conversion Date for any Notes or (y) on the effective date of any Fundamental Change or Make-Whole Fundamental Change, unless such adjustment has already been made.
 
(l) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee (and the Conversion Agent if not the Trustee) an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume without inquiry that the last Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to each Holder at its last address appearing on the Note Register of this Indenture.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price and the principal amount on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, to the Holder who surrenders a Note to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of the Note. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee in certain circumstances, without the consent of the Holders of the Notes, and in certain other circumstances, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to execute supplemental indentures modifying the terms of the Indenture and the Notes as described therein. It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any past Default or Event of Default under the Indenture and its consequences.

Exhibit 3.2
1.1
REGISTERED OFFICE
The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.
1.2
OTHER OFFICES
The board of directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
2.1
PLACE OF MEETINGS
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the Corporation.
2.2
ANNUAL MEETING
(a) An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the board of directors shall each year fix.
(b) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (1) pursuant to the corporation's proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (2) by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (3) by any stockholder of record of the corporation (the "Record Stockholder") at the time of the giving of the notice required in the following paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (3) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or propose business (other than business included in the corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (such act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) at an annual meeting of stockholders.
(c) For nominations or business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a Record Stockholder pursuant to clause (3) of the foregoing paragraph, (1) the Record Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation, (2) any such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and (3) the Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, must have acted in accordance with the representations set forth in the Solicitation Statement required by these bylaws. To be timely, a Record Stockholder's notice shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 45 or more than 75 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.2(c), if the meeting is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the Record Stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day before such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there has been no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or indicating the increase in the size of the board of directors made by the corporation at least 10 days before the last day a Record Stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with the preceding sentence, a Record Stockholder's notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a Record Stockholder's notice.
(d) Such Record Stockholder's notice shall set forth:
1. if such notice pertains to the nomination of directors, as to each person whom the Record Stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected, and a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the board of directors, in accordance with the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines;
 
2. as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
3. as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "party"):
(i) the name and address of each such party;
(ii)(A) the class, series, and number of shares of the corporation that are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by each such party, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by each such party, and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which either party has a right to vote, directly or indirectly, any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation held by each such party (for purposes of this Section 2.2(d), a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially directly or indirectly by each such party that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which either party is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that each such party is directly or indirectly entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of each such party's immediate family sharing the same household (which information set forth in this paragraph shall be supplemented by such stockholder or such
 
beneficial owner, as the case may be, not later than ten (10) days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, that if such date is after the date of the meeting, not later than the day prior to the meeting);
(iii) any other information relating to each such party that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and
(iv) a statement whether or not each such party will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation reasonably believed by the Record Stockholder or beneficial holder, as the case may be, to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by the Record Stockholder (such statement, a "Solicitation Statement").
(e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at an annual meeting unless (i) the person is nominated by a Record Stockholder in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(3) or (ii) the person is nominated by or at the direction of the board of directors. Only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these bylaws, to declare that such defectively proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
(f) For purposes of these bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.2. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
2.3
SPECIAL MEETING
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders, other than those required by statute, may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the president. The board of directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.
(b) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors. The notice of such special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) by any stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the secretary setting forth the information set forth in Section 2.2(d)(1) and 2.2(d)(3) of this Article II. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder of record's notice required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder of record's notice. A person shall not be eligible for election or reelection as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) by a stockholder of record in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Article II.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.3. Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
2.4
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS
All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise required by these bylaws, the certificate of incorporation or the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
 
2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6
QUORUM
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.8
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). Each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. The board of directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
 
A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election (with abstentions and "broker non-votes" not counted as votes cast either for or against such nominee's election); provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders at which (i) the number of nominees for the board exceeds the number of open board seats; (ii) one or more nominees has been nominated pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees set forth in these bylaws or pursuant to the provisions of any future law, rule or regulation that require the Corporation to allow stockholder nominations in a manner other than that provided in these bylaws; and (iii) any such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting (other than director elections), unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
2.9
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.10
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
In the event of the delivery to the corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and any revocation thereof is referred to in this Section 2.10 as a "Consent"), the secretary of the corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consents and shall as soon as practicable thereafter conduct such reasonable investigation as he deems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the validity of such Consents and all matters incident thereto, including, without limitation, whether the holders of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consents have given consents. No consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be effective unless delivered to the corporation within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation.
 
2.11
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS
Except as otherwise permitted by law, in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
2.12
PROXIES
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
 
stockholder; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, in the manner provided by law. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
2.14
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.
2.15 ORGANIZATION
Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chairman of the board or, in his or her absence, the president of the Corporation or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints. Whether or not a quorum is present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn such meeting to another place, date and time.
3.1
POWERS
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
3.2
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors constituting the whole board of directors shall be eleven, provided that the board of directors may change such number (but not below the number of directors then in office) by resolution from time to time within a range of seven to fifteen directors.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
3.3
ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless a stockholder demands election by written ballot at the meeting and before voting begins.
3.4
RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. When one or more directors so resigns, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies. When one or more directors resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date or upon the happening of a future event, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
A vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by a court order may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor shall be elected and qualified.

Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or uncertificated shares.

The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote, provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 26, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., July 27, 2011Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 26, 2011. Revenue for the period was $752.0 million, gross margin was $338.5 million (45.0%), and net income was $125.9 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $809.1 million, gross margin of $374.0 million (46.2%), and net income of $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, for the March 2011 quarter. Shipments for the June 2011 quarter were $793 million compared to $813 million during the March 2011 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for the June 2011 quarter exclude certain costs for restructuring and impairments, the non-cash portion of convertible debt interest expense, and tax expense associated with legal entity restructuring. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP results to determine "non-GAAP" results for the March 2011 quarter. Management uses non-GAAP operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
Non-GAAP net income was $142.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, in the June 2011 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $182.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, for the March 2011 quarter. Gross margin for the June 2011 quarter was $338.5 million or 45.0%, compared to gross margin of $374.0 million or 46.2%, for the March 2011 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower factory and field utilization as a result of the decline in volume from the March to the June quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the June 2011 quarter were $179.5 million compared with the March 2011 quarter of $177.0 million and reflect our continued investments in strategic development activities.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the June 2011 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.3 billion at the end of the June 2011 quarter, compared to $1.4 billion at the end of the March 2011 quarter. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $198.1 million or 26% of revenue during the June 2011 quarter. Additionally, during the quarter the Company completed a convertible debt financing and generated $835.5 million in net cash, which includes proceeds from warrant sales, offset by issuance fees and purchase of a convertible note hedge. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2011 quarter were $257.6 million and $157.2 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $70.4 million as of June 26, 2011.
"Lam delivered solid operating performance and financial results for the June quarter," said Steve Newberry, Lam's chief executive officer and vice chairman. "We are seeing significant near term declines in wafer fab equipment spending, and as result our September quarter shipments, revenues and earnings per share will be well below our June quarter results. Even in this environment, we continue to execute to our strategic priorities and make key R&D investments that position the company for future growth opportunities. Longer term, we continue to believe that on a rolling average basis, twelve-month wafer fab equipment spending should be healthy over the next several years and our outstanding product portfolio, supported by our solid balance sheet and strong cash generation capabilities enable the company to deliver increased value to our customers and our shareholders in that environment," Newberry concluded.

Lam Research Corporation Announces an Increase to Share Repurchase Program
FREMONT, Calif., September 1, 2011 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase of $500 million in the Company's authorization for share repurchases, raising the total authorization under the program to $750 million. Repurchases of the Company's common stock may be made in both public market and private transactions, and may include the use of derivative contracts and structured share repurchase agreements. The increased authorization limit is effective immediately.
The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and will be funded using the Company's available cash. As of June 26, 2011, Lam Research had approximately $2.3 billion in total gross cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments, and as of August 12, 2011 had approximately 124 million shares outstanding.
"We believe that this increase to our share repurchase program enhances our flexibility with respect to providing value to our shareholder base," stated Steve Newberry, Lam's chief executive officer and vice chairman. "Our strong balance sheet and cash generation capabilities provide us with the ongoing opportunity to leverage this flexibility."

These plans are dependent on the Company's future financial condition, its determinations of the continued value of a repurchase program, changing business conditions in the semiconductor industry and the overall economy, and its plans for reacting to those changes, changing customer demands, the success of the Company's competitors' strategies including their development of new technologies, and the technical challenges presented by the Company's current product offerings and new products.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 25, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., October 19, 2011Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the September 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 25, 2011. Revenue for the period was $680.4 million, gross margin was $283.9 million (41.7%), and net income was $71.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $752.0 million, gross margin of $338.5 million (45.0%), and net income of $125.9 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the June 2011 quarter. Shipments for the September 2011 quarter were $580 million compared to $793 million during the June 2011 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the September 2011 and June 2011 quarters exclude certain costs for restructuring and impairments and the amortization of convertible note discount. Additionally, the Company's non-GAAP results for the June 2011 quarter exclude tax expense associated with legal entity restructuring. Management uses non-GAAP operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
Non-GAAP net income was $78.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the September 2011 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $142.3 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, for the June 2011 quarter. Gross margin for the September 2011 quarter was $283.9 million, or 41.7%, compared to gross margin of $338.5 million, or 45.0%, for the June 2011 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable product mix and reflects the impact of lower factory utilization as a result of the decline in business volumes. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the September 2011 quarter were $182.8 million compared with the June 2011 quarter of $179.5 million resulting from our continued increase in research and development activities.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the September 2011 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the September 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.2 billion at the end of the September 2011 quarter, compared to $2.3 billion at the end of the June 2011 quarter. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances during the quarter was due to activity related to our stock repurchase program partially offset by cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $86.9 million or 13% of revenue during the September 2011 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the September 2011 quarter were $179.5 million and $112.5 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $43.4 million as of September 25, 2011.
"As expected, our September quarter results reflect the impact of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty on wafer fab equipment spending," said Steve Newberry, Lam's chief executive officer and vice chairman. "While customers are currently delaying near-term expansion plans, they continue to make investments in leading edge technologies that enhance their competitiveness. We expect that when advanced technology device demand increases, capacity expansion will resume. Lam traditionally excels in this environment, and we remain focused on making the critical strategic investments that extend our technical leadership, strengthen customer trust and drive our long-term growth," Newberry concluded.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 30, 2011, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") entered into Employment Agreements with Stephen G. Newberry (the "Newberry Agreement") and Martin B. Anstice (the "Anstice Agreement"). The agreements are effective as of January 1, 2012.
The summaries of the terms of the agreements that follow are qualified in their entirety by the respective texts of such agreements. The Newberry Agreement and the Anstice Agreement are attached as Exhibits 10.158 and 10.159 respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference
Newberry Agreement
The Newberry Agreement supersedes the Employment Agreement between the Company and Mr. Newberry dated January 1, 2003, as amended December 17, 2008 and the Employment Agreement dated July 1, 2009, as amended December 7, 2010. The Newberry Agreement provides that Mr. Newberry shall serve as the Company's Vice Chairman, for a term commencing on January 1, 2012 and ending on December 31, 2014, subject to the right of the Company or Mr. Newberry, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Newberry Agreement prior to December 31, 2014, and provided that Mr. Newberry's employment under the Newberry Agreement will terminate upon his death or "disability," as defined in the Newberry Agreement.
Under the Newberry Agreement, Mr. Newberry will receive a base salary of $500,000 per year, subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Board. That amount will be paid solely in cash during 2012, and during 2013 and 2014 will be paid partially in cash, and partially in restricted stock units, as described in the Newberry Agreement. Mr. Newberry will continue to vest in his current 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but he will not be eligible for future awards under the Company's short-term or long term variable compensation plans. Mr. Newberry will receive other benefits, such as health insurance, vacation, and other benefit plans and compensation programs generally applicable to executive officers of the Company. He will be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred in the performance of his duties and will receive a reasonable level of administrative support.
If a "change in control" (as defined in the Newberry Agreement) of the Company occurs during the period of Mr. Newberry's employment under the Newberry Agreement, and if there is an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Newberry Agreement) of Mr. Newberry's employment either in contemplation of or within the 12 months following such change in control, Mr. Newberry will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's Base Compensation; (2) if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year which Mr. Newberry would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated ; (3) medical benefits, as described in the Newberry Agreement; (4) vesting, as of the date of termination, of the unvested portions of any stock option or restricted stock unit awards granted to Mr. Newberry prior to the change in control, and issuance of shares underlying any restricted stock units ("RSUs") within 10 days of the date of termination with generally a two year exercise period applicable to any stock options; and (5) payment of any amounts accrued as of the last full completed quarter as of the change in control under any long-term cash-based variable compensation plans (which will only include the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Mr. Newberry) of the Company (the "Long Term Plans"), plus an amount equal to the remaining target amount under the Long Term Plans.
If Mr. Newberry is involuntarily terminated other than in connection with a change in control, he will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's base salary, plus (2) if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year which Mr. Newberry would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated; and (3) medical benefits, as described in the Newberry Agreement; and (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs that were granted 12 months or more before the termination date, in an amount such that the total vested shares under any such awards equals the total number of calendar months worked, divided by the total number of months over which such award vests, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such award; and any Long Term Plans (which will only include the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Mr. Newberry) which are accrued as of the last full completed quarter prior to the termination date, paid within ten days.
In the event of Mr. Newberry's death or disability, he (or his estate) will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Newberry's Base Compensation less, in the case of Mr. Newberry's death, certain insurance payments, and, if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year which Mr. Newberry would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated plus; (2) payment of certain accrued but unpaid amounts under

any Long Term Plan (which will only include the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Mr. Newberry); (3) medical benefits (in the case of Mr. Newberry's death, benefits to which Mr. Newberry's dependents are entitled); and (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs, in an amount equal to the greater of 50% of such awards or an amount such that the total vested shares under any such awards equals the total number of calendar months worked, divided by the total number of months over which such award vests, multiplied by the number of shares subject to such award.
In the event of any other termination of Mr. Newberry's employment during the term of the Newberry Agreement, Mr. Newberry will be entitled to payment of any earned but unpaid base salary, any accrued and unused vacation, and reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the business of the Company. If Mr. Newberry voluntarily resigns, he will be entitled to no additional benefits (except as he may be eligible for under the Executive Retiree Medical Plan), any unvested stock options will be cancelled 90 days after the date of termination unless earlier exercised, and any RSUs will be cancelled on the date of termination.
The Newberry Agreement subjects Mr. Newberry to customary confidentiality and non-competition obligations during the term of the Newberry Agreement, and non-solicitation obligations for a period of six months following the termination of his employment.
Anstice Agreement
The terms of the Anstice Agreement are substantively similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, with the following material differences:
The Anstice Agreement provides that Mr. Anstice shall serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
Under the Anstice Agreement, Mr. Anstice will receive a base salary of $665,000, subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Independent Members of the Board. Mr. Anstice will not receive a portion of his base salary in restricted stock units for 2013 and 2014 but will be eligible for future awards under the Company's Short Term and Long Term Plans.
The severance terms of the Anstice Agreement are generally similar to those of the Newberry Agreement, provided that (1) Mr. Anstice will receive 18 months' base salary instead of 12 months' Base Compensation in the event of his involuntary termination, whether or not in connection with a change in control; and (2) in the event of death or disability, neither Mr. Anstice nor his estate will be entitled to any payment based on Mr. Anstice's Base Compensation; and (3) for stock options granted prior to July 1, 2009, the grant agreements will control how long the stock options remain exercisable.

Exhibit 10.158
Stephen G. Newberry Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Stephen G. Newberry (the "Vice Chairman") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Vice Chairman desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Vice Chairman's employment with the Company, which supersedes the Employment Agreements between the parties dated January 1, 2003 as amended December 17, 2008 (the "Original Agreement") and the Employment Agreement effective July 1, 2009, as amended (the "Second Agreement").
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Vice Chairman by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Vice Chairman shall serve as the Vice Chairman of the Company, and in such capacity the Vice Chairman shall perform the duties and responsibilities as Vice Chairman of the Company, including: (i) working with the Company's Chief Executive Officer and senior management team; (ii) periodically meeting with customers and investors; and (iii) other duties and as the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Vice Chairman, in all cases to be consistent with Vice Chairman's position.
Position
(b) . Vice Chairman shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Vice Chairman shall not devote substantial business efforts and time to another for profit company except as authorized by the lead independent Director. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Vice Chairman from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company, such as serving on the Board of Directors of another for profit company.
Vice Chairman's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Vice Chairman for the period commencing on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2014 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will not be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Vice Chairman's
Termination
employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
(i) . The Company may terminate the Vice Chairman's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Vice Chairman thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Vice Chairman's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Vice Chairman's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Vice Chairman ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Vice Chairman the compensation Vice Chairman would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Vice Chairman's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Vice Chairman. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Vice Chairman may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Vice Chairman may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Vice Chairman, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Vice Chairman during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Vice Chairman
(c) . The Vice Chairman's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Vice Chairman's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Vice Chairman gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Vice Chairman has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
3. .
Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $500,000. For 2012, such amount will be paid solely in cash. For 2013 and 2014, the Vice Chairman will receive a portion of his compensation in restricted stock units, as described in Section 3(c) below, and a portion of his compensation as a cash retainer for Vice Chairman's service as a Director. The cash retainer will be in the same amount, and payable at the same time, as non-employee Directors. In 2013 and 2014, the cash portion of the Vice Chairman's base compensation will be determined by subtracting the restricted stock unit grant value and the cash retainer from the annual base compensation rate. All cash base compensation will be payable in regular installments in accordance with normal Company payroll. In addition, Vice Chairman will be entitled to such increases in Vice Chairman's base compensation, if any, as may be determined from time to time in the sole discretion of the Board. The annual compensation specified in this Section 3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Compensation." During the Employment Period, the Vice Chairman shall serve as a member of the Board without additional compensation.
Base Compensation
(b) . Vice Chairman shall not be entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally (collectively, such plans are referred to in this Agreement as the "Combined Plans" and which are currently the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which includes the Multi-Year Incentive Plan and the equity components of the Long-Term Incentive Plan), subject to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determination of the independent members of the Board. Vice Chairman will continue to vest in his current 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan but will not be eligible for future awards under the Combined Plans.
Variable Compensation
(c) . In 2013 and 2014, the Vice Chairman will receive a portion of his compensation as a restricted stock unit grant. For 2013, the restricted stock unit grant will have a value equal to one-half of the grant value of the annual non-employee director restricted stock unit award and, for 2014, the restricted stock unit grant will have a value equal to the grant value of the annual non-employee director restricted stock unit award. In these cases, the number of shares underlying the restricted stock units shall be determined by dividing (x) the grant value by (y) the price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant (which may be a closing price or an average price over a designated period, determined in the same manner as calculated for the Company's non-employee directors). The Vice Chairman's restricted stock units will be granted on the same date, and have the same terms, as restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors of the Company for his service as a Director. Vice Chairman shall not be entitled to receive any other stock option grants or other equity based compensation except as may be granted to him in the discretion of the independent members of the Board.
Restricted Stock Units
(d) . The Vice Chairman shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.
Deferred Compensation
 
(e) . During the Employment Period, the Vice Chairman shall be eligible to participate in the benefit plans and compensation programs maintained by the Company of general applicability to executive officers of the Company, including (without limitation) retirement plans, savings or profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement or excess-benefit plans, equity award, life, disability, health, accident and other insurance programs, paid vacations (but accruing at not less than three weeks per year), and similar plans or programs, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan or program in question and to the determination of the independent members of the Board or the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan or program, as appropriate.
Benefits
(f) . The Company shall reimburse the Vice Chairman for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Vice Chairman in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement. Reasonable and necessary business expenses shall include travel expenses between Vice Chairman's principal location of employment (Montana and Cabo San Lucas) and Company headquarters as well as travel to other locations on Company business.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
(g) . During the Employment Period, the Company will provide the Vice Chairman with a reasonable level of administrative support acceptable to the Vice Chairman. This may either be provided by the Company directly or may be reimbursed by the Company pursuant to appropriately incurred expenses by the Vice Chairman.
Administrative Support
4. . Vice Chairman and the Company, to the extent applicable, agree to use reasonable good faith efforts, to the extent reasonably practicable and not materially adverse to the Vice Chairman, to structure payment of all amounts of Vice Chairman's compensation from the Company so as to avoid non-deductibility of any such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or any successor provision.
Section 162(m)
5. .
Benefits Upon a Change in Control
(a) If a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) occurs during the Employment Period, and an Involuntary Termination of Vice Chairman's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control
1
or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
2
, then:
 
 
 
 
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Vice Chairman a lump sum equal to twelve (12) months of Base Compensation.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the 2011 calendar year, the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman, not later than March 15, 2012, the full amount he would have earned under such 2011 plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if his employment had not been terminated.
(iii) The Vice Chairman will receive the benefits he qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan, or if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Vice Chairman qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Vice Chairman prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date. The stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms, or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs to the Vice Chairman within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which would potentially include only the 2011/2012, if unpaid, Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Vice Chairman, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control plus the Remaining Target Amount (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Vice Chairman.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Vice Chairman's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
 
a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Vice Chairman within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
(ii) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Vice Chairman's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Vice Chairman shall receive the Payment Amounts when ordinarily paid out.
Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Vice Chairman has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Vice Chairman's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Vice Chairman's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Vice Chairman with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Vice Chairman by the Company, regardless of whether the Vice Chairman's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Vice Chairman is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Vice Chairman is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).
i.e.
6. .
Severance Benefits other than in a Change in Control

In the event of any termination of Vice Chairman's employment at any time during the term of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman any unpaid Base Compensation due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (2) the Company shall pay the Vice Chairman all of the Vice Chairman's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (3) following submission of proper expense reports by the Vice Chairman (or his estate), the Company shall reimburse the Vice Chairman for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Vice Chairman in connection with the business of the Company. These payments shall be made promptly at the Company's next scheduled payroll date.

7. . The following terms referred to in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:
Definition of Terms
(a) . "Cause" shall mean: (1) Vice Chairman's willful and continued failure to perform the duties and responsibilities of his position after there has been delivered to Vice Chairman a written demand for performance from the Board which describes the basis for the Board's belief that Vice Chairman has not substantially performed his duties and responsibilities and provides Vice Chairman with thirty (30) days to take corrective action; (2) Any act of personal dishonesty knowingly taken by Vice Chairman in connection with his
Cause
 
responsibilities as an employee of the Company with the intention or reasonable expectation that such action may result in substantial financial enrichment of Vice Chairman; (3) Vice Chairman's conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony; (4) a willful and knowing act by the executive which constitutes gross misconduct; or (5) A willful breach of a material provision of this Agreement by the Vice Chairman. Termination for Cause shall not be deemed to have occurred unless, by the affirmative vote of all of the members of the Board (excluding the Vice Chairman), at a meeting called and held for that purpose (after reasonable notice to the Vice Chairman and his counsel and after allowing the Vice Chairman and his counsel to be heard before the Board), a resolution is adopted finding that in the good faith opinion of such Board members the Vice Chairman was guilty of conduct set forth in (1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this Section 7(a), specifying the particulars thereof.
(b) . "Disability" shall mean that the Vice Chairman is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reasons of any readily determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuing period of not less than twelve (12) months. A Disability must be certified by an approved Company physician. The date of Disability is the date on which the Disability is incurred.
Disability
(c) . "Involuntary Termination" shall mean:
Involuntary Termination
(i) a material reduction of the Vice Chairman's duties or responsibilities as Vice Chairman (other than for Cause or as a result of death or Disability);
(ii) a material reduction in the Vice Chairman's Base Compensation and benefits package, other than a reduction in Base Compensation which is part of, and generally consistent with, a general reduction of salaries of all executive officers of the Company and of any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control, or other than a change in Vice Chairman's benefits package that continues to provide Vice Chairman with comparable benefits to those enjoyed prior to the change;
(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Vice Chairman's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than: (A) any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally, (B) any such reduction resulting from a drop in the Company's stock price or (C) unless in connection with a Change in Control, in which case this clause (C) shall not apply, any such reduction that is based on a good faith market review of executive compensation conditions and levels (for similar positions in comparable companies) conducted in accordance with the normal compensation evaluation process applicable to executive officers of the Company generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual Base Compensation (determined in the same manner as in Section 7(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits and the 2011/2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, if unpaid), and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) associated with that award;
 
(iv) the relocation of the Company's principal executive office to a location more than fifty (50) miles from its present location but only if the Vice Chairman is required to change his principal place of employment to such new location;
(v) any termination of the Vice Chairman's employment by or at the request of the Company other than for Cause, Disability or death;
(vi) the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of this Agreement by any successors contemplated in Section 8 below; or
(vii) any material breach by the Company of any material provision of this Agreement;
subject to the following: (A) None of the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination if the Vice Chairman has agreed thereto. (B) The Board providing notice of its intent not to enter into, renew or extend this Agreement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof shall not be considered an Involuntary Termination (although any of the foregoing actions which occurs after the Board provides notice of its intent not to enter into, renew or extend this Agreement may constitute an Involuntary Termination). (C) Except with respect to an event described in Section 7(c)(v), the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination only if and to the extent that (x) within 90 days of the occurrence of the events giving rise to an Involuntary Termination, the Vice Chairman provides written notice to the Company setting forth in reasonable detail such facts which Vice Chairman believes constitute Involuntary Termination, (y) any circumstances constituting Involuntary Termination remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following the Company's receipt of such written notice, and (z) the Termination Date occurs within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the initial existence of the event giving rise to an Involuntary Termination.
(d) . "Termination Date" shall mean:
Termination Date
(i) In the case of a termination for Cause, the last day of the thirty (30) day notice period, unless the reason for such termination is cured by the Vice Chairman prior to the end of the thirty (30) day period;
(ii) In the case of a Company initiated Involuntary Termination (under Section 2(b)(i) of this Agreement), the last day of the ninety (90) day notice period required under such section, or such earlier date at which the Company waives notice and pays the Vice Chairman in lieu of such notice;
(iii) In the case of the Vice Chairman's Voluntary Resignation or of an Involuntary Termination initiated by the Vice Chairman (each under Section 2(b)(ii) of this Agreement), the last day of the applicable notice period required under such section, or such earlier date at which the Company waives notice and pays the Vice Chairman in lieu of such notice;
(iv) In the case of Vice Chairman's death, the date of such death; and
 
(v) In the case of Vice Chairman's Disability, the date of such Disability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Involuntary Termination occurring in contemplation of a Change in Control, if the Termination Date would otherwise have occurred prior to the Change in Control, the Termination Date shall take place on the date of the Change in Control. If more than one Termination Date may apply, then the priority provisions of Section 2(e) of this Agreement shall determine which Termination Date controls. The Company and the Vice Chairman shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.
(e) . "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:

(iii) The stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior hereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company's assets (other than to a subsidiary or subsidiaries); or
(iv) Any other event as determined by the independent members of the Board, in the sole discretion of the independent members of the Board.

For all purposes under this Agreement, the term "Company" shall include any Successor Company which executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this subsection (a) or which becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law.
Company's Successors

(a) . Notices and all other communications contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by Federal Express or a comparable air courier company. In the case of the Vice Chairman, notices sent by courier shall be addressed to him at the home address that he most recently communicated to the Company in writing. In the case of the Company, notices sent by courier shall be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to the attention of its Chief Legal Officer.

Any termination by the Company for Cause or by the Vice Chairman as a result of a Voluntary Resignation or any Involuntary Termination shall be communicated by a notice of termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with Section 9(a) of this Agreement.

Notice of Termination
10. .
Non-Compete; Non-Solicit
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Vice Chairman's services are special and unique and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Vice Chairman's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 10 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.
 
(b) The Vice Chairman agrees that prior to the Termination Date, the Vice Chairman will not either directly or indirectly, whether as a director, officer, consultant, employee or advisor or in any other capacity (1) render any planning, marketing or other services respecting the creation, design, manufacture or sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and/or software to any business, agency, partnership or entity ("Restricted Business") other than the Company, or (2) make or hold any investment in any Restricted Business in the United States other than the Company, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than 2% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation. For purposes of this Section 10, the term "Company" shall mean and include the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, any Successor Company and any other corporation or entity of which the Vice Chairman may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or any Successor Company.
(c) Prior to the Termination Date, and for the period extending six (6) months thereafter, the Vice Chairman will not directly induce or attempt to influence any employee of the Company to leave its employ and join any Restricted Business in or within 50 miles of Fremont, California.
(d) The Vice Chairman agrees that the Company would suffer an irreparable injury if he were to breach the covenants contained in subparagraphs (b) or (c) and that the Company would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Vice Chairman hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
(e) If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 10 shall be deemed to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope or other provisions thereof, then the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provisions hereof (but only to the extent necessary to render such restrictions enforceable) and then enforce this Section 10 in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.
11. .
Existing Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreements
Vice Chairman represents and warrants (1) that prior to the date hereof he has provided the Company with true and complete copies of any and all written confidentiality and/or non-compete agreements to which Vice Chairman is a party as of the date hereof (together with a written description of any such oral agreements), and (2) to the best of Vice Chairman's knowledge, full compliance with the terms of each such agreement will not materially interfere with Vice Chairman's duties hereunder (except to the extent that Vice Chairman reasonably may determine to absent himself from certain Company meetings and communication during the first year of the Employment Period). The Vice Chairman further covenants that he will not willfully and knowingly fail to fully abide by the terms of any and all such agreements and will work in good faith with the Company to avoid any breach thereof.
12. .
Arbitration
 
At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Vice Chairman's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Vice Chairman agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Vice Chairman shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Vice Chairman and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Vice Chairman shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Vice Chairman, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Vice Chairman shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Vice Chairman, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
 
(a) . The Vice Chairman shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Vice Chairman may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Vice Chairman and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Vice Chairman). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Vice Chairman, or the Vice Chairman's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Original and Second Agreements shall be superseded by this Agreement effective January 1, 2012. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Vice Chairman pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Vice Chairman for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Vice Chairman to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Vice Chairman be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Vice Chairman under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Vice Chairman shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
Whole Agreement; Amendment
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
 
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Vice Chairman's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Vice Chairman is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Vice Chairman are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Vice Chairman's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Vice Chairman's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Vice Chairman in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Vice Chairman with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Vice Chairman on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Vice Chairman's termination of employment shall refer to Vice Chairman's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Vice Chairman during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Vice Chairman in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Vice Chairman is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Vice Chairman.
Assignment by Company
 
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Vice Chairman agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Vice Chairman's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Exhibit 10.159
Martin B. Anstice Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Martin B. Anstice (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company, which supersedes the Employment Agreement between the parties effective July 1, 2009, as amended (the "Original Agreement").
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's office and position.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on January 1, 2012, and ending on December 31, 2014 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The Board will provide notice of the Company's intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the Board provides notice of the Company's intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
3. .

The Company shall pay Executive, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts").

Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.

(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).

At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to
 
the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the "Original Agreement" shall be superseded by this Agreement effective January 1, 2012. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a
 
"deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On December 14, 2011, Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Lam"), and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Lam ("Merger Sub") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Novellus Systems, Inc., a California corporation ("Novellus"). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Novellus (the "Merger"), with Novellus continuing as the surviving corporation ("Surviving Corporation") and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Lam.
As a result of the Merger, subject to certain exceptions, (i) each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Novellus will be converted into the right to receive 1.125 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Lam common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustment, (ii) each issued and outstanding option to acquire shares of Novellus' common stock issued under any equity compensation plan of Novellus, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an option (A) exercisable for that number of shares of Lam common stock equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Novellus common stock for which such option was exercisable multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (B) with an exercise price per share equal to (x) the per share exercise price of such Novellus stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger divided by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; and (iii) each outstanding restricted stock unit with respect to shares of common stock granted pursuant to any equity compensation plan of Novellus, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a restricted stock unit, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting requirements and deferral provisions) as applied to each such restricted stock unit, with respect to the number of shares of Lam common stock that is equal to the number of shares of Novellus common stock subject to the restricted stock unit immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share). Holders of Novellus common stock prior to the merger will receive cash in the merger in lieu of fractional shares of Lam common stock.
Each of Lam and Novellus have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) to conduct their respective operations in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice between the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and (ii) not to solicit proposals relating to alternate transactions during such period and not to engage in discussions concerning or furnish non-public information in connection with such alternative transactions. In addition, Lam and Novellus made certain other customary covenants, including, among others and subject to certain exceptions, (A) in the case of Lam, to cause a stockholders meeting to be held to consider approval of the issuance of Lam common stock in the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and, in the case of Novellus, to cause a shareholders meeting to be held to consider adopting the Merger Agreement and (B) in the case of Lam, for its board of directors to recommend approval by Lam's stockholders of the issuance of Lam common stock in the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and in the case of Novellus, for its board of directors to recommend adoption by Novellus shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement by Novellus' shareholders, (ii) approval by Lam's stockholders of the issuance of Lam common stock in the Merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (iii) approval for listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market of the Lam common stock to be issued in the Merger; (iv) expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period; (v) absence of laws, orders, judgments and injunctions that restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger; (vi) effectiveness under the Securities Act of 1933 of the Form S-4 registration statement relating to the issuance of the Lam common stock in the Merger and absence of any stop order in respect thereof or proceedings by the SEC for that purpose; (vii) the receipt of certain tax opinions regarding the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; (viii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to the businesses of Lam and Novellus and compliance by Lam and Novellus with their respective covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; and (ix) the number of shareholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Lam and Novellus and further provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Lam may be required to pay Novellus, or Novellus may be required to pay Lam, a termination fee of $120,000,000.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by this reference.
Richard Hill, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Novellus, has agreed, among other things, to vote his shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms of a voting agreement entered into with Lam (the "Voting Agreement"). The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, a form of which is filed as Exhibits 10.1 hereto, and is incorporated into this report by this reference.
This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, or a solicitation of any vote or approval, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. In connection with the proposed merger, Lam intends to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that will include a joint proxy statement of Lam and Novellus that also constitutes a prospectus of Lam. Lam and Novellus will furnish the joint proxy statement/prospectus and other relevant documents to their respective security holders in connection with the proposed merger of Lam and Novellus. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION, WE URGE SECURITY HOLDERS AND INVESTORS TO READ THE JOINT PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS (INCLUDING ALL AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND OTHER DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LAM AND NOVELLUS AND THE PROPOSED MERGER. The proposals for the merger will be made solely through the joint proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, a copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it becomes available) may be obtained free of charge from Lam Research Corporation, Investor Relations, 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, CA 94538-6401, or from Novellus Systems, Inc., Investor Relations, 4000 North First Street, San Jose, CA 95134. Security holders will be able to obtain, free of charge, copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and S-4 Registration Statement and any other documents filed by Lam or Novellus with the SEC in connection with the proposed Merger at the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov, and at the companies' websites at www.lamresearch.com and www.novellus.com, respectively.
This announcement contains, or may contain, "forward-looking statements" concerning Lam and Novellus (together such companies and their subsidiaries being the "Merged Company"), which are subject to the safe harbor provisions created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Generally, the words "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "may," "should," "could," and other future-oriented terms identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following: (i) the expected benefits of the Merger and the repurchase program, the expected accretive effect of the Merger and the repurchase program on the Merged Company's financial results, expected cost, revenue, technology and other synergies, the expected impact for customers, employees and end-users, future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, earnings, economic performance, financial condition, losses and future prospects; (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of Lam's or Novellus's operations; (iii) the effects of government regulation on Lam's, Novellus's or the Merged Company's business; (iv) future industry developments and trends; (v) the anticipated timing of shareholder meetings and completion of the proposed merger and the repurchase program; and (vi) assumptions underlying any of the foregoing statements.
These forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of Lam and Novellus and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond Lam's and Novellus's ability to control or estimate precisely and include, without limitation: the ability to obtain governmental or stockholder approvals of the Merger or to satisfy other conditions to the Merger on the proposed terms and timeframe; the possibility that the Merger does not close when expected or at all, or that the companies may be required to modify aspects of the Merger to achieve regulatory approval; the ability to realize the expected synergies or other benefits from the transaction in the amounts or in the timeframe anticipated; the potential harm to customer, supplier, employee and other relationships caused by the announcement or closing of the Merger; the ability to integrate Novellus's and Lam's businesses in a timely and cost-efficient manner; uncertainties in the global economy and credit markets; unanticipated trends with respect to the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry; and rates of change in, future shipments, margins, market share, capital expenditures, revenue and operating expenses generally; volatility in quarterly results and in the stock price of the Merged Company; customer requirements and the ability to satisfy those requirements; customer capital spending and their demand for the Merged Company's products; the ability to defend the Merged Company's market share and to gain new market share; anticipated growth in the industry and the total market for wafer-fabrication and support equipment and the Merged Company's growth relative to such growth; levels of research and development ("R&D") expenditures; the estimates made, and the accruals recorded, in order to implement critical accounting policies (including but not limited to the adequacy of prior tax payments, future tax liabilities and the adequacy of the Merged Company's accruals relating to them); access to capital markets; the ability to manage and grow the Merged Company's cash position; the sufficiency of the Merged Company's financial resources to support future business activities (including but not limited to the repurchase program, operations, investments, debt service requirements and capital expenditures); inventory levels and inventory valuation adjustments; the impact of legal proceedings; unexpected shipment delays which adversely impact shipment volumes; inaccuracies related to the timing and satisfaction of remaining obligations related to vacated leases; the inability to recover the amortized cost of investments in auction-rate securities, market changes negatively affecting auction-rate securities and the government's inability to guarantee the underlying securities; the inability to enforce the Merged Company's patents and protect its trade secrets; and other risks and uncertainties, including those detailed from time to time in Lam's and Novellus's periodic reports (whether under the caption Risk Factors or Forward Looking Statements or elsewhere). Neither Lam nor Novellus can give any assurance that such forward-looking statements will prove to have been correct. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Neither Lam nor Novellus nor any other person undertakes any obligation to update or revise publicly any of the forward-looking statements set out herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a forecast, projection or estimate of the future financial performance of Lam, Novellus, or the Merged Company, following the implementation of the Merger or otherwise. No statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that the earnings per share, profits, margins or cash flows of Lam or the Merged Company for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published figures.
The directors and executive officers of Novellus and Lam may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the approval of the proposed transaction. Lam plans to file the registration statement that includes the joint proxy statement/prospectus with the SEC in connection with the solicitation of proxies to approve the proposed transaction. Information regarding Lam's directors and executive officers and their respective interests in Lam by security holdings or otherwise is available in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 19, 2011 and its Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on September 19, 2011. Information regarding Novellus's directors and executive officers and their respective interests in Novellus by security holdings or otherwise is available in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2011 and its Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 8, 2011. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants is or will be included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement, and other relevant materials to be filed with the SEC, when they become available, including in connection with the solicitation of proxies to approve the proposed transaction and to elect directors.
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties made by Lam and Novellus to, and solely for the benefit of, each other. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure letters provided by the parties to each other in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. While Lam does not believe that these disclosure letters contain information that the securities laws require the parties to publicly disclose, other than information that has already been so disclosed, they do contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement. You should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Lam or Novellus, since they were only made as of the date of the Merger Agreement and are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure letters. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Lam and Novellus rather than establishing matters as facts. Finally, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the companies' public disclosures.

FREMONT, Calif., and SAN JOSE, Calif., December 14, 2011  Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Novellus Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVLS) in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion. The combined enterprise, which will retain the name of Lam Research Corp., will be a semiconductor equipment company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products and multiple opportunities to drive value creation through significant revenue and cost synergies. Total cost synergies are expected to be approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, Lam announced a $1.6 billion common stock repurchase program. This new program, which replaces Lam's existing share repurchase program, is targeted to be executed over the 12 months following the close of the transaction. Lam expects the transaction to be accretive to its non-GAAP earnings within one year after transaction close.
Lam Research and Novellus Systems are among the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor equipment, both companies playing a pivotal role in defining the features and capabilities of next-generation devices. The two companies possess complementary product capabilities, with Lam's leadership in etch and single-wafer clean equipment aligning with Novellus's leadership in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologies. The combined company will be well-positioned to lead the industry through critical technology transitions including 3D structures in advanced logic and NAND memory as well as the scaling to 450 mm wafers. The combined company will also be positioned to grow revenue at a faster rate than either company could achieve individually by:
 
 
 
Under the terms of the agreement, Novellus stockholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam Research common stock for each share of Novellus that they own, in a tax-free exchange. Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share. Upon closing, Lam and Novellus stockholders will own approximately 59 percent and 41 percent, respectively, of the combined company.
Lam's $1.6 billion stock repurchase program will be funded from the combined company's existing on-shore cash and on-shore cash generation. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48 percent cash.
"This strategic combination positions Lam Research to lead the development of next-generation semiconductor manufacturing technology and productivity solutions at a time when growing semiconductor demand and increased device complexity are creating significant business opportunities," said Steve Newberry, vice chairman and chief executive officer of Lam Research. "Novellus's strong capabilities and market leadership in deposition and surface preparation technologies enable Lam to become more deeply entrenched in critical semiconductor manufacturing processes that are important to our customers. We believe the adjacency of our process technologies will provide significant technical benefits that will enable us to achieve greater success together and accelerate our growth."
Richard Hill, chairman and chief executive officer of Novellus, said, "We believe the combination of Lam and Novellus is great news for our customers, investors and employees. The complementary skills, technologies and product offerings of Lam and Novellus will create a strong platform for delivering innovative and cost-effective solutions. For our investors, it presents an ability to participate in the combined company's future value creation potential."
Martin Anstice, who, as previously announced, will assume the position of CEO of Lam Research from Steve Newberry effective January 1, 2012, will continue as CEO following the close of the transaction. He is currently Lam's president and chief operating officer. Timothy Archer, chief operating officer of Novellus, will become chief operating officer of the combined company; and Ernest Maddock, chief financial officer of Lam, will remain chief financial officer. The board of directors of Lam will add four new directors jointly nominated by Lam and Novellus.
Anstice said, "We are excited to join forces with a remarkable company like Novellus. We believe that the people, products and technology that Novellus brings to Lam Research will position the combined company to accelerate revenue and earnings growth, realize significant operating efficiencies, and deliver stockholder value. Together, we believe that we will be able to optimize technology and product roadmaps, strengthen our competitive position in the market, and leverage complementary customer relationships to accelerate growth."
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Lam's and Novellus's stockholders and review by U.S. and international regulators. The companies expect the transaction, which has been unanimously approved by both Lam's and Novellus's boards of directors, to close in the second calendar quarter of 2012.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as the exclusive financial advisor, and Jones Day acted as legal counsel to Lam. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as the exclusive financial advisor, and Morrison & Foerster LLP acted as legal counsel to Novellus.

Frequently Asked Questions
Rationale and Key Questions
December 14, 2011
 
 
 
Lam and Novellus are announcing a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which they will be combined in a $3.3 billion all-stock transaction.
 
The combination of Lam and Novellus creates a semiconductor equipment company with a broad portfolio of market-leading products and offering technical expertise in its core competencies. Both companies are among the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor equipment, both playing a pivotal role in defining the features and capabilities of semiconductor devices.
The two companies present complementary product capabilities, with Lam's leadership in etch and single-wafer clean equipment aligning with Novellus' leadership in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologies. The combined company will be well positioned to lead the industry through the next critical transitions in semiconductor manufacturing, including 3D structures in advanced logic and NAND memory as well as the scaling to 450 mm wafers.
 
The newly combined entity will retain the name Lam Research.
 
Novellus is the world's eighth-largest semiconductor equipment manufacturer, specializing in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologiesboth critical functions in manufacturing semiconductor chips. Novellus is a market leader in CVD, ECD and dry strip technologies. It also has a group selling surface preparation equipment into industrial applications. Its primary competitors include Applied Materials, ASMI and Mattson Technologies.
 
Lam is the world's fourth-largest semiconductor equipment maker, specializing in plasma etch and single-wafer clean technologies which also play a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing. Lam is the market-share leader in etch, and holds the No. 2 position in wafer cleaning.
 
 
 
This is an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Novellus stockholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam common stock for each share of Novellus that they own. Based on Lam's closing price on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at $44.42 per share of Novellus common stock. Upon closing, Lam and Novellus stockholders will own approximately 59 percent and 41 percent, respectively, of the combined company. In conjunction with the transaction, Lam Research has authorized a $1.6 billion share repurchase program.
 
Today's industry dynamics make the timing of this transaction critical. Our customers are facing unprecedented technology challenges driven by increased process complexity and increasing manufacturing costs with each subsequent technology node. As a combined entity, we will be able to leverage our technology adjacencies to more quickly deliver solutions addressing our customers' technology and productivity challenges.
Moreover, the combination better positions Lam to address the industry's expected migration to 3D device technology and to 450 mm wafers. The transition to 450 mm technology is an expensive proposition for equipment makers. By leveraging adjacent technologies and integrating R&D resources, we can make this transition more cost effective.
 
Novellus is a leader in thin-film deposition and surface preparation technologies, with specific expertise in chemical vapor deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, electrochemical deposition, ultraviolet thermal processing and dry strip equipment. Novellus has leading market share positions in chemical vapor deposition, dry strip and copper electron-chemical deposition.
Lam's leadership in etch and single-wafer clean equipment aligns well with Novellus' technology. Combining the expertise of adjacent process steps provides technical benefits that enhance the company's ability to bring innovative and cost-effective solutions to market in a timely manner. The combined company will have a broad portfolio of market-leading products and will be strongly positioned to lead the industry in the development of next-generation technology.
 
 
 
The company's product lines cover adjacent steps in the wafer fabrication process. The products are complementary and give the combined company the ability to provide more holistic solutions to the market. The broader product portfolio and greater scale will further enhance the company's relevance to its customers.
 
Novellus' current structure is very similar to Lam's, with business units around specific product lines and accounts teams focused around specific customers, plus manufacturing, customer service and support corporate functions. There is an intention to comprehensively integrate Lam and Novellus across functions.
 
The combination creates the opportunity to grow revenue at a faster rate by:
Revenue growth synergies:
 
 
 
The company expects to realize cost synergies through this transaction of approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the end of CY2013, excluding tax. We will achieve these synergies by:
Cost-reduction synergies:
 
 
 
 
 
 
This transaction's value creation results in significant upside for Novellus' shareholders. Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share, a 28% premium to current. In addition, Novellus' shareholders will share in the upside of the combined entity through the value of synergies realized, and will additionally receive the benefit of earnings-per-share accretion from the authorized $1.6 billion share repurchase program. The transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months post transaction close.
 
 
 
The addition of Novellus makes Lam a stronger partner with customers and enhances revenue growth potential. The combined company will have a broader product portfolio, and a stronger financial profile. Lam shareholders will also receive upside from synergies realized. In addition, Lam shareholders will benefit from the authorized $1.6 billion share repurchase program. The transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months post transaction close. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48 percent cash.
 
Customers should be pleased with this transaction because the strengths of the combined company create an improved ability to address customer needs and deliver on customer requirements. Our customers are facing steep technical challenges today driven by increased process complexity and growing manufacturing costs. The combined company can leverage complementary experience, technologies, and product capabilities to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions that address customers' needs. Further, the combined company is positioned to effectively and efficiently develop 450 mm tools to help customers get to market faster.
 
Novellus shareholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam for every share of Novellus owned. Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share. The purchase price reflects a multiple of 16.5 times analyst consensus estimates for 2012 earnings. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48% cash.
The transaction is expected to be accretive to Lam's earnings on a non-GAAP basis within 12 months following deal closure. The transaction can generate significant shareholder value, resulting from the additional market opportunities that the combined company can address and the revenue and cost synergies that can be achieved through the transaction. We are confident in our ability to achieve the synergy opportunities available in this transaction.
 
 
 
We explored multiple options and ultimately pursued an all-stock transaction, which we believe maximizes the benefit to the joint shareholder base. Under the terms of Novellus' existing convertible debt, other deal structures required payments to bondholders that were not in the best interests of the combined company's shareholders. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48% cash.
 
Lam's transaction strategy is structured to meaningfully improve the company's performance through diversification. This transaction represents the most relevant technology / process adjacency expansion for Lam. The SEZ transaction in 2007 has provided us with very relevant experience in integrating companies.
The management and board of directors will be integrated across Lam and Novellus. We expect that the companies' strong cultural fit and proximity will aid the integration plan. Our integration team will be focused on delivering the key value drivers for the transaction. The integration planning will include strong participation from employees of both companies.
 
Given the adjacency of deposition, etch, clean, and surface preparation process steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process, it is beneficial to understand how each step integrates with the next. Our ability to leverage the knowledge that we have gleaned through our leadership positions in each of these three critical process segments will enable us to better solve customer challenges as a combined company.
 
We want Lam to continue to be recognized as the most-trusted supplier in the industry. In addition, we would like Lam to be seen as the preeminent global supplier of a broad base of differentiated technology and innovative productivity solutions to the semiconductor industry. Our solutions help customers get to market quickly and offer the lowest total cost of ownership, which is something we're known for.
 
The company shall retain the name "Lam Research" and maintain the ticker symbol (Nasdaq: LRCX).

The company markets its products through its direct sales force and manufacturer's representatives primarily in the U.S., Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Europe, Southeast Asia, and China.
 
Novellus' worldwide workforce consists of approximately 2,700 employees strategically located in 15 countries around the world, near the company's operating facilities and customer locations.
 
Integration planning will happen over the next several months, but as we see it today, potential workforce reductions represent the minority of known cost-related synergies that we are evaluating.
 
Until the transaction is complete, Lam and Novellus will continue to operate as independent companies. Any employment actions would not occur until after all closing conditions have been satisfied and the transaction is complete.
 
Our manufacturing operations in Livermore, Villach, Tualatin, San Jose, and Rendsburg will continue normal operations for the foreseeable future.
 
Employees will continue to own the same number of Lam shares or RSUs after the close that they own immediately before the close.
 
Yes. Service and support will be integrated after the transaction closes, and the companies are still working on integration plans.
 
 
 
A webpage link has been set up on the Lam intranet where employees can get more information about this announcement and ask questions. Novellus employees can find more information on the Fifth Arrow under the link "Novellus and Lam Merger Information."
 
The philosophy of Lam's compensation and benefits program is not expected to change. In the near-term, Novellus will continue with its existing salary and benefits programs.
 
We'll be focusing on integration and synergies. This includes integrating our board and management teams, identifying specific technical and product synergies, understanding customer relationship synergies, quantifying cost synergies, working closely on the integration plan, and providing regular updates on the process to key constituents.
 
Customers should know that we are very excited about this transaction and that we believe Lam and Novellus' combined resources will enable us to address their specific application needs and technology roadmaps with new cutting-edge products, broader technical expertise and an unparalleled level of quality, service and support. In addition, we intend to leverage the technical benefits of our adjacent technologies to optimize the collective development of next-generation 450 mm tools.
 
 
 
Frequently Asked Questions
Financial
 
 
 
 
The transaction is a stock-for-stock merger. Under the terms of the agreement, Novellus shareholders will receive 1.125 shares of Lam common stock for each share of Novellus they own. Based on the closing stock price of Lam on December 14, 2011, this represents a value to Novellus shareholders of $44.42 per share. Upon closing, Lam and Novellus shareholders will own approximately 59% and 41%, respectively, of the combined company.
 
Based on the closing price of Lam's stock on December 14, 2011, the transaction values Novellus at a price of $44.42 per common share. The price is based on a detailed financial review and valuation of the existing businesses, the additional market opportunities we can address together, and the expected annualized cost synergies in the range of approximately $100 million by the fourth quarter of 2013. The purchase price reflects a multiple of 16.5 times analyst consensus estimates for 2012 earnings.
 
We have analyzed a number of scenarios, and while we assume that the industry will continue to be cyclical, we anticipate that WFE demand will be healthy through CY2012. That said, we believe the success of this transaction is less about the cycle than it is about the complementary fit of Lam's and Novellus' product portfolios, which will better position the combined organization to lead the industry in the development of next-generation semiconductor manufacturing technology.
 
 
 
 
The transaction is expected to be accretive to Lam's non-GAAP earnings within one year of transaction close. We anticipate earnings-per-share accretion to continue to improve long-term through strong Novellus revenue growth, operating improvements and synergy opportunities. Finally, the transaction provides attractive returns on invested capital to Lam's shareholders.
 
The share repurchase program in an important part of this transaction. It is targeted to be executed within 12 months after the close of the transaction and is expected to result in the transaction being accretive to Lam's non-GAAP earnings within 12 months of close. Assuming completion of the stock repurchase program, this will essentially result in a total financial impact on the company as if the deal were structured with approximately 48% cash.
 
 
The companies believe that the combination creates the opportunity to grow revenues at a faster rate by:
Revenue growth synergies:
 
 
 
The company expects to realize pre-tax cost synergies through this transaction of approximately $100 million on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of CY2013. We will achieve these synergies by:
Cost-reduction synergies:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We expect to write off items typical of transactions including write-offs of charges related to the integration of Novellus' operations, as well as adjustments associated with accounting for the transaction as a business combination.
 
The majority of integration-related expenses will be incurred in the first year of operations, subsequent to transaction closure as we pursue operational synergies and integrate Novellus into Lam.
 
All transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Only direct financing fees are costs of the transaction that can be capitalized in purchase accounting under US GAAP.
 
 
The announced $1.6 billion share repurchase program is targeted to be executed within 12 months after the closing of the transaction.
 
We intend to finance the share repurchase with existing on-shore cash, on-shore cash generation, and short-term investments on the combined company's balance sheet.
 
The pro forma balance sheet (as of September 2011) will have $3.1 billion gross cash and $1.7 billion total debt.
 
Since the transaction is being executed as an all-stock transaction, the existing Novellus senior convertible notes will be assumed and will remain on Lam's balance sheet.
 
 
 
Lam's current credit rating is Baa1 / BB+. Lam will be in discussions with credit rating agencies relative to this transaction and they would publish any updates based upon their internal review schedules.
 
 
The agreement is expected to be approved and closed before June of 2012.
 
This agreement is subject to approval by Lam and Novellus shareholders as well as customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
 
We do not expect other companies to generate the level of value that we can deliver in the Lam-Novellus combination. We believe the value we are providing to the shareholders of both companies is compelling.
 
We are acquiring the entire company, including all assets and liabilities. Most notably, we are assuming the convertible debt on Novellus' balance sheet.
 
Yes, the transaction represents a fundamental change for Novellus. Certain employment and financing agreements will be addressed in the closing.
 
Goldman, Sachs & Co. acted as the exclusive financial advisor for the transaction, and Jones Day acted as legal counsel to Lam. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as the exclusive financial advisor, and Morrison Foerster acted as legal counsel to Novellus.
 
 
 
Frequently Asked Questions
Markets / Products and Roadmaps
 
 
 
 
Novellus competes primarily in the thin-film deposition and surface preparation semiconductor equipment segments. The company also competes in the industrial segment with its surface polishing and grinding equipment. The company's specific expertise includes multiple forms of deposition process equipment (chemical vapor deposition, plasma enhanced CVD, physical vapor deposition, electrochemical deposition), ultraviolet thermal processing, and surface preparation equipment. There is no overlap between products and we expect to offer all products after the transaction closes.
 
According to Gartner Dataquest, the deposition and surface preparation segments represented approximately 14% of total WFE spend. The combined company will serve approximately 32% of the total WFE market.
 
Novellus holds strong positions in critical segments of the CVD market including #2 in PECVD and #1 in ECD. Deposition steps in each of these segments are expected to increase and we expect Novellus is well-positioned through product innovation to gain market share in these and other segments over time. Novellus is also #2 in strip.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 25, 2011
FREMONT, Calif., January 25, 2012Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the December 2011 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 25, 2011. Revenue for the period was $584.0 million, gross margin was $234.8 million, or 40.2%, operating expenses were $187.3 million, and net income was $33.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $680.4 million, gross margin of $283.9 million, or 41.7%, operating expenses of $184.5 million, and net income of $71.8 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the September 2011 quarter. Shipments for the December 2011 quarter were $563 million compared to $580 million during the September 2011 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the December 2011 and September 2011 quarters exclude the amortization of convertible note discounts and certain costs for restructuring and impairments. Additionally, the Company's non-GAAP results for the December 2011 quarter exclude certain acquisition related costs. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
Non-GAAP net income was $41.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the December 2011 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $78.3 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the September 2011 quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for the December 2011 quarter was $234.0 million, or 40.1%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of $283.9 million, or 41.7%, for the September 2011 quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was due to both lower factory and field utilization as a result of the decline in business volumes and product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the December 2011 quarter decreased to $180.4 million compared with the September 2011 quarter of $182.8 million as a result of reductions in variable compensation associated with the operating income level.
Lam Announces Financial Results for the December 2011 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2011 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.4 billion at the end of the December 2011 quarter, compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the September 2011 quarter. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances during the quarter was primarily due to operating activities and the cash settlement of a stock repurchase agreement. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $169.0 million or 29% of revenue during the December 2011 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the December 2011 quarter increased to $191.8 million and $117.3 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $15.5 million as of December 25, 2011.
"Lam delivered solid financial results in the December quarter consistent with expectations, supported by initial leading edge capacity shipments across all segments," said Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "Throughout 2011, we executed on our long-term growth strategy by investing in the technology and productivity solutions that address our customers' most critical needs and position Lam to solidify and grow its position in etch and single-wafer clean. In addition, as announced in December, we plan to extend our product and services portfolio and leadership in wafer fab equipment via the acquisition of Novellus Systems. We believe that the complementary market positions, technologies, product capabilities and leadership of both companies will provide more comprehensive and faster solutions to our customers and provide improved financial performance for our shareholders," Anstice concluded.

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 25, 2012
FREMONT, Calif., April 18, 2012Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the March 2012 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 25, 2012. Revenue for the period was $659.0 million, gross margin was $267.1 million, or 40.5%, operating expenses were $209.0 million, and net income was $45.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $584.0 million, gross margin of $234.8 million, or 40.2%, operating expenses of $187.3 million, and net income of $33.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the December 2011 quarter. Shipments for the March 2012 quarter were $713 million compared to $563 million during the December 2011 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the March 2012 and December 2011 quarters exclude the amortization of convertible note discounts and certain acquisition-related costs. Additionally, the Company's non-GAAP results for the March 2012 quarter exclude certain integration-related costs and certain costs associated with a customer bankruptcy filing, and non-GAAP results for the December 2011 quarter exclude certain restructuring and impairment charges. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
Non-GAAP net income was $60.6 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the March 2012 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $41.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the December 2011 quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for the March 2012 quarter was $269.8 million, or 40.9%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of $234.0 million, or 40.1%, for the December 2011 quarter. Gross margin performance reflected improved factory utilization as a result of greater business volumes offset by less favorable customer mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the March 2012 quarter increased to $196.8 million compared with the December 2011 quarter of $180.4 million primarily due to increased levels of investment in support of our strategic growth initiatives as well as higher levels of variable compensation, aligned with the improved financial performance.
 
Lam Announces Financial Results for the March 2012 Quarter
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2012 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances were $2.6 billion at the end of the March 2012 quarter, compared to $2.4 billion at the end of the December 2011 quarter. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances during the quarter was primarily due to operating activities and the cash settlement of a stock repurchase agreement that did not execute. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $146.4 million during the March 2012 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the March 2012 quarter increased to $246.2 million and $139.6 million, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $18.5 million as of March 25, 2012.
"Lam began 2012 on a strong note, delivering against our financial commitments for the March quarter while executing against the significant plans which support our strategic growth objectives," stated Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "We continue to make substantive progress in advancing the capabilities of our core products in etch and single-wafer clean to help our customers address next-generation process challenges. Additionally, we are moving steadily towards the expected completion of our acquisition of Novellus Systems, with integration planning well underway. These activities combine to make calendar 2012 a transformative year for the Company, and we are excited about the opportunities we see ahead."

The following disclosure supplements the "Questions and Answers" portion of the Proxy Statement:
Q: What is the stock repurchase program?
A: In connection with the announcement of the merger, Lam Research announced on December 14, 2011 that it intends to return up to $1.6 billion to Lam Research stockholders via a stock repurchase program, targeted to be completed by the end of the 12 month period following the completion of the merger. The $1.6 billion stock repurchase program replaced Lam Research's existing stock repurchase program. Lam Research does not expect there will be a need to incur additional indebtedness beyond that already incurred by each company in order to finance the announced repurchase program. Lam anticipates that the stock repurchase program will be financed from existing cash, cash generation and short term investments on the combined company's balance sheet. Lam currently has a credit rating of Baa1 from Moody's and BBB- from Standard & Poor's, has disclosed its stock repurchase plans to both, and has not been informed by either of any negative rating impact.

The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this announcement. Neither Novellus nor any other person undertakes any obligation to update or revise publicly any of the forward-looking statements set out herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a forecast, projection or estimate of the future financial performance of Lam Research, Novellus, or the Merged Company, following the implementation of the merger or otherwise.

The projections disclosed in this filing were not prepared for purposes of public disclosure, nor were they prepared on a basis designed to comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of projections, or GAAP. Neither Lam Research's nor Novellus' current, former or any other independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the projections summarized herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, such projections. The independent auditors' reports incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement relate to historical financial information. They do not extend to any prospective financial information and should not be seen to do so.
Although presented with numerical specificity, the projections were prepared in the context of an estimated market spending environment, are not actual facts and were based on numerous variables and assumptions, and various other matters specific to Lam Research's and Novellus' businesses that are inherently uncertain and, in many cases, are beyond the control of Lam Research and Novellus. The projections for both Lam Research and Novellus are subject to many risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the impact of general economic factors outside of Lam Research's and Novellus' control and other operating conditions and risks and uncertainties relating to Lam Research's and Novellus' business (including their ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods, or to adopt new strategies in response to changed circumstances) and other factors described under "Certain Projections Reviewed by Novellus" and "Certain Projections Reviewed by Lam Research" in the Proxy Statement, all of which are subject to change. In addition, other than with respect to the estimated synergies, the projections and estimates do not take into account any of the transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement, including the merger and associated expenses, or Lam Research's or Novellus' compliance with their respective covenants under the merger agreement. As a result, actual results likely will differ, and may differ materially, from those contained in the projections.
The inclusion of a summary of the projections in this filing should not be regarded as an indication that any of Novellus, Lam Research, BLMS, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives consider the projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such. None of Novellus, Lam Research, BLMS, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives can give any shareholder of Novellus or stockholder of Lam Research or other person any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions and estimates underlying the projections are shown to be in error. None of Novellus, Lam Research, BLMS, or their respective affiliates, officers, directors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any shareholder of Novellus, stockholder of Lam Research or other person regarding Lam Research's or Novellus' ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the projections or that the projected results will be achieved. The summaries of the projections included herein are not being included to influence your decision whether to vote for the merger and the transactions contemplated in connection with the merger, but are being provided solely because the projections were considered in connection with the merger.
Novellus has made no representations to Lam Research, BLMS or any other person, and neither Lam Research nor BLMS has made any representations to Novellus or any other person, concerning the projections or the assumptions and estimates on which they are based. Novellus and Lam Research urge all shareholders to review Novellus' and Lam Research's most recent SEC filings for a description of Novellus' and Lam Research's reported financial results.

2. as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
3. as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "party"):
(i) the name and address of each such party;
(ii)(A) the class, series, and number of shares of the corporation that are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by each such party, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by each such party, and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which either party has a right to vote, directly or indirectly, any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation held by each such party (for purposes of this Section 2.2(d), a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially directly or indirectly by each such party that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which either party is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that each such party is directly or indirectly entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of each such party's immediate family sharing the same household (which information set forth in this paragraph shall be supplemented by such stockholder or such
 
beneficial owner, as the case may be, not later than ten (10) days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, that if such date is after the date of the meeting, not later than the day prior to the meeting);
(iii) any other information relating to each such party that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and

(e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at an annual meeting unless (i) the person is nominated by a Record Stockholder in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(3) or (ii) the person is nominated by or at the direction of the board of directors. Only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.2. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
2.3
SPECIAL MEETING
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders, other than those required by statute, may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the president. The board of directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.
(b) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors. The notice of such special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) by any stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the secretary setting forth the information set forth in Section 2.2(d)(1) and 2.2(d)(3) of this Article II. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder of record's notice required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting.

The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
 
2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6
QUORUM
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.8
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). Each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. The board of directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
 
A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election (with abstentions and "broker non-votes" not counted as votes cast either for or against such nominee's election); provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders at which (i) the number of nominees for the board exceeds the number of open board seats; (ii) one or more nominees has been nominated pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees set forth in these bylaws or pursuant to the provisions of any future law, rule or regulation that require the Corporation to allow stockholder nominations in a manner other than that provided in these bylaws; and (iii) any such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting (other than director elections), unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
2.9
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.10
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
In the event of the delivery to the corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and any revocation thereof is referred to in this Section 2.10 as a "Consent"), the secretary of the corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consents and shall as soon as practicable thereafter conduct such reasonable investigation as he deems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the validity of such Consents and all matters incident thereto, including, without limitation, whether the holders of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consents have given consents. No consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be effective unless delivered to the corporation within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation.
 
2.11
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING
Except as otherwise permitted by law, in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
2.12
PROXIES
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders
 
entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, in the manner provided by law. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
2.14
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.
2.15 ORGANIZATION
Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chairman of the board or, in his or her absence, the president of the Corporation or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints. Whether or not a quorum is present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn such meeting to another place, date and time.
3.1
POWERS
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
3.2
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors constituting the whole board of directors shall be eleven, provided that the board of directors may change such number (but not below the number of directors then in office) by resolution from time to time within a range of seven to fifteen directors.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
3.3
ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless a stockholder demands election by written ballot at the meeting and before voting begins.
3.4
RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. When one or more directors so resigns, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies. When one or more directors resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date or upon the happening of a future event, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
A vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by a court order may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor shall be elected and qualified.
3.5
PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE
The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director whom the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.
3.9
QUORUM
At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
3.10
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

Any reference in these bylaws to action in writing shall include action by electronic transmission to the fullest extent permitted by law.
3.13
FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any, of attending each meeting of the board of directors and may be paid a fixed sum for attending each meeting of the board of directors or a stated salary as director. No such payment shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees may be allowed like compensation for attending committee meetings.
3.14
APPROVAL OF LOANS TO OFFICERS
The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiaries who is not an "executive officer" (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or a director of the corporation, whenever in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section contained shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.
3.15
REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS
Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

3.16
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the board of directors, a chairman of the board of directors as well as a vice chairman, neither of whom shall be considered an officer of the corporation solely by reason of being appointed to either position.

The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote, provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

Section 11. .
Procedure Upon Application for Indemnification
(a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by the Board, by a majority vote of the directors of the Company who are not parties to the Proceeding, and, if it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination. In the event that (i) there are no disinterested directors serving on the Board, (ii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to the preceding sentence within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iii) a determination is made pursuant to the preceding sentence that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or (iv) there has been a Company Change in Control prior to the determination by the Board, Indemnitee shall be entitled to have his/her entitlement to indemnification to be determined by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee and, if it is so determined by Independent Counsel that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten (10) days after such determination.
(b) Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Board or Independent Counsel, as applicable, making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to the Board or such counsel, as applicable, upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and
 
reasonably necessary to such determination. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Board or Independent Counsel, as applicable, shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
(c) In the event that Indemnitee exercises his/her right to have his/her entitlement to indemnification determined by Independent Counsel as contemplated by Section 11(a), the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee. The Company may, within ten (10) days after written notice of such selection, deliver to the Indemnitee a written objection to such selection; , , that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within twenty (20) days after the later of submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, and the final disposition of the Proceeding, including any appeal therein, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, the Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company to the selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 13(a) of this Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
provided
however
(d) In the event that Independent Counsel is selected to make the determination of Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification as contemplated by clause (ii) or (iii) of the second sentence of Section 11(a), neither the failure of the Board to have made a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Board that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct, and the Independent Counsel making such determination shall be bound by the presumptions set forth in Section 12.
(e) The rights set forth in this Section 11 with respect to Indemnitee selecting Independent Counsel to determine Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, Indemnitee's rights set forth in Section 13.
Section 12. .
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings
(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the Board or Independent Counsel, as applicable, making such determination shall
 
presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10(a) of this Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by the Independent Counsel of any determination contrary to that presumption. Neither the failure of the Board or of Independent Counsel to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Board or by Independent Counsel that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
(b) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of guilty, or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he/she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was unlawful.
nolo contendere
(c) For purposes of any determination of good faith, Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or the Board or counsel selected by any committee of the Board or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser, investment banker or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Company or the Board or any committee of the Board. The provisions of this Section 12(c) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Agreement.
(d) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement.
Section 13. .
Remedies of Indemnitee
(a) Subject to Section 13(e), in the event that (i) a determination is made pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) advancement of Expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement, (iii) no determination of entitlement to indemnification shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request for indemnification, (iv) payment of indemnification is not made pursuant to Section 5 or 6 or the last sentence of Section 11(b) of this Agreement within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor, or (v) payment of indemnification pursuant to Section 3, 4 or 7 of this Agreement is not made within ten (10) days after a determination has been made that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, Indemnitee shall be entitled to an adjudication by a court of his/her entitlement to such indemnification or advancement.
 
Alternatively, Indemnitee, at his/her option, may seek an award in arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Indemnitee shall commence such proceeding seeking an adjudication or an award in arbitration within 180 days following the date on which Indemnitee first has the right to commence such proceeding pursuant to this Section 13(a); , , that the foregoing clause shall not apply in respect of a proceeding brought by Indemnitee to enforce his/her rights under Section 5 of this Agreement. The Company shall not oppose Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or award in arbitration.
provided
however
(b) In the event that a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement, as the case may be.
(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13, absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.
(d) The Company shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 13 that the procedures and presumptions of this Agreement are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement. The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within ten (10) days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by law, such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advancement from the Company under this Agreement or under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement or insurance recovery, as the case may be, in the suit for which indemnification or advances is being sought.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no determination as to entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement shall be required to be made prior to the final disposition of the Proceeding, including any appeal therein.
Section 14. .
Non-exclusivity; Survival of Rights; Insurance; Subrogation
(a) The rights of indemnification and to receive advancement as provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Charter, the Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of
 
this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee in his/her Corporate Status prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement than would be afforded currently under the Charter, Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
(b) The Company currently maintains an insurance policy or policies providing liability insurance for directors, officers, employees, or agents of the Company or of any other Enterprise, and to the extent liability insurance coverage of comparable scope can continue to be purchased at reasonable cost, the Company shall continue to maintain such coverage. Indemnitee shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with its or their terms to the maximum extent of the coverage available for any such director, officer, employee or agent under such policy or policies. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such policies. Where it is feasible to do so without materially impairing the Indemnitee's ability to defend himself/herself in a Proceeding, Indemnitee agrees to cooperate with the Company to maximize the insurance coverage applicable to a particular Proceeding, including without limitation by agreeing to be jointly represented by legal counsel with other directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries of the Company who are also involved with the Proceeding, or by agreeing to legal representation by a legal services provider acceptable to the insurance carrier(s) that underwrite the liability insurance coverage purchased by the Company; that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to pressure an Indemnitee's or his/her legal counsel to violate any applicable rule of professional responsibility applicable to legal counsel's provision of legal services.
provided, however,
(c) In the event of any payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.
(d) The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment of amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder (or for which advancement is provided hereunder) if and to the extent that Indemnitee has otherwise actually received such payment under any insurance policy, contract, agreement or otherwise.
 
(e) The Company's obligation to provide indemnification or advancement hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement from such other Enterprise. Where Indemnitee has indemnification rights relating to a Proceeding through both the Company and any other Enterprise involved with the Proceeding and the other Enterprise disputes primary responsibility to advance Expenses to or indemnify Indemnitee, the indemnification rights under this Agreement shall apply; that the Company's agreement to protect Indemnitee will be without prejudice to any rights the Company may have to seek from such other Enterprise reimbursement of any expenses or other amounts paid on behalf of Indemnitee.
provided, however,
Section 15. . This Agreement shall continue until and terminate upon the later of: (a) ten (10) years after the date that Indemnitee shall have ceased to serve as a [director][ Section 16 officer] of the Company or (b) one (1) year after the final termination of any Proceeding, including any appeal, then pending in respect of which Indemnitee is granted rights of indemnification or advancement hereunder and of any proceeding commenced by Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13 of this Agreement relating thereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Indemnitee and his/her heirs, executors and administrators. The Company shall require and cause any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all, substantially all or a substantial part, of the business and/or assets of the Company, by written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Indemnitee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
Duration of Agreement
Section 16. . If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement (including without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; (b) such provision or provisions shall be deemed reformed to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law and to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties hereto; and (c) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, each portion of any Section of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that is not itself invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested thereby.

(b) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral, written and implied, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof; , , that this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Charter of the Company, the Bylaws of the Company and applicable law, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder.
provided
however

Lam Research Corporation Announces Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 24, 2012
FREMONT, Calif., July 25, 2012Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the June 2012 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 24, 2012. The Company completed the merger with Novellus Systems Inc. (Novellus) on June 4, 2012; results reflect twenty days of contributed financial performance resulting from that purchase, prior period comparable results represent Lam Stand-alone performance without exception. Revenue for the period was $741.8 million, gross margin was $298.2 million, or 40.2%, operating expenses were $265.5 million, and net income was $18.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $659.0 million, gross margin of $267.1 million, or 40.5%, operating expenses of $209.0 million, and net income of $45.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the March 2012 quarter. Shipments for the June 2012 quarter were $816 million compared to $713 million during the March 2012 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the June 2012 and March 2012 quarters exclude the amortization of convertible note discounts and certain acquisition and integration-related costs. Additionally, the Company's non-GAAP results for the June 2012 quarter exclude costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, and acquisition-related inventory fair value impact. The non-GAAP results for the March 2012 quarter exclude certain costs associated with a customer bankruptcy filing. Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.
 
 
Lam Announces Financial Results for the June 2012 Quarter
Comparative highlights between the June 2012 quarter and March 2012 quarter are as follows:
 
Lam Stand-alone non-GAAP gross margin performance improved in the June 2012 quarter as compared to the March 2012 quarter due to favorable customer and product mix and improved factory and field utilization. Lam Stand-alone non-GAAP operating expenses decreased in the June 2012 quarter as compared to the March 2012 quarter due to reductions in employee-related benefit costs.
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the June 2012 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased to $3.0 billion at the end of the June 2012 quarter, compared to $2.6 billion at the end of the March 2012 quarter. This increase included the impact of $1.1 billion acquired in connection with the Novellus transaction, primarily offset by stock repurchases. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $96.7 million during the June 2012 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the June 2012 quarter increased to $335.4 million and $164.8 million, respectively. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances included $87.1 million and $21.1 million from Novellus related operations, respectively. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $23.4 million as of June 24, 2012.
"Lam delivered solid financial performance in the June quarter, with sequential growth across our core product and service businesses," said Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "The quarter also marked the closing of our acquisition of Novellus Systems, and integration is already underway. As we've shared over the past couple of quarters, this combination offers the potential for accelerated growth and we remain focused on aggressively executing our plans to achieve that potential."

Lam Research Corporation Announces Retirement of Chairman, James W. Bagley; Stephen G. Newberry Appointed his Successor
FREMONT, Calif., August 30, 2012 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that James W. Bagley, who has served as the company's chairman of the board of directors for the last 15 years, has decided to retire from the industry, including his position on Lam's board, effective as of the company's annual meeting of stockholders which will be held on November 1, 2012. The board appointed Lam's current vice-chairman, Stephen G. Newberry, to succeed Bagley as chairman upon Mr. Newberry's reelection to the board at the annual meeting.
"My tenure at Lam Research has been the highlight of my career. The executives and employees that I have worked with over the past 16 years have been the most inspired and dedicated people I have had the privilege to lead," Bagley said.
Commenting on Bagley's retirement, Newberry stated, "It has been both a pleasure and a privilege to work alongside Jim for nearly three decades. He is an icon in our industry. During his tenure as Lam's CEO from 1997 through 2005, Jim was responsible for transforming Lam Research into a premier semiconductor capital equipment company. In particular, he pioneered the introduction of an outsourced business model to more effectively manage costs across industry cycles; and propelled Lam to the leading market share position in etch. On behalf of the company, I extend a sincere thanks to Jim for his service and contribution. We wish him every happiness and fulfillment in his personal and philanthropic pursuits."
"As a leader, Jim has been an inspiration to me and to Lam's entire employee population," said Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "The mission, vision, and core values, established under Jim's leadership in 1998, remain virtually unchanged today and continue to exemplify our strong corporate culture which is centered on the principle that the customer comes first in our thinking and decision making. While Jim's presence will be sorely missed at Lam, his spirit will continue to inspire us well into the future," said Anstice.

On September 7, 2012, Lam Research Corporation (the "Company") entered into Employment Agreements with Ernest E. Maddock (the "Maddock Agreement") and Richard A. Gottscho (the "Gottscho Agreement") and also entered into change in control agreements with Gary Bultman, David Hemker, Terese Kemble, and Sarah O'Dowd (the "Change in Control Agreements"). All of the agreements are effective as of July 18, 2012.
The following summaries of the terms of the agreements are qualified in their entirety by the respective texts of such agreements. The Maddock Agreement, the Gottscho Agreement, and the form of the Change in Control Agreements are attached as Exhibits 10.174, 10.175, and 10.176, respectively, to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
Maddock Agreement
The Maddock Agreement replaces the Employment Agreement between the Company and Mr. Maddock effective July 1, 2009, which expired by its terms in June 2012. The Maddock Agreement provides that Mr. Maddock shall serve as the Company's Senior Vice President for a three-year term commencing on July 18, 2012 and ending on July 17, 2015, subject to the right of the Company or Mr. Maddock, under certain circumstances, to terminate the agreement prior to such time.
Under the Maddock Agreement, Mr. Maddock will receive a base salary of $485,000 per year, subject to annual adjustment at the discretion of the Company's Compensation Committee. Mr. Maddock is also entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally, subject to the applicable terms and conditions of such plans and the determination of the Compensation Committee, and to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan. Mr. Maddock will receive other benefits, such as health insurance, vacation, and other benefit plans and compensation programs generally applicable to executive officers of the Company.
If a "change in control" (as defined in the Maddock Agreement) of the Company occurs during the period of Mr. Maddock's employment under the Maddock Agreement, and if there is an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Maddock Agreement) of Mr. Maddock's employment either in contemplation of or within the 12 months following such change in control, Mr. Maddock will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Maddock's then-current base salary (without giving effect to any salary reduction program

then in place), plus an amount equal to the average of the last five annual payments made to Mr. Maddock under the Company's Annual Incentive Plan or any predecessor or successor plans (the "Short Term Plan," and such average, the "Short Term Plan Average"), plus an additional amount equal to the Short Term Plan Average multiplied by the number of full months worked in the calendar year in which Mr. Maddock's employment is terminated divided by twelve; (2) payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan which were earned by Mr. Maddock but not yet paid; (3) certain medical benefits, as described in the Maddock Agreement; (4) vesting, as of the date of termination, of the unvested portions of any stock option or restricted stock unit ("RSUs") awards granted to Mr. Maddock prior to the change in control; and (5) payment of any amounts accrued as of the change in control under any long-term cash-based variable compensation plans of the Company (the "Long Term Plans"), plus an amount equal to the remaining target amount under the Long Term Plans.
If Mr. Maddock is involuntarily terminated other than in connection with a change in control, he will be entitled to (1) a lump-sum cash payment equal to 12 months of Mr. Maddock's then-current base salary (without giving effect to any salary reduction program then in place), plus an amount equal to fifty percent of the Short Term Plan Average, plus an amount equal to the amount which Mr. Maddock would have earned under the Short Term Plan for such calendar year in which he terminated multiplied by the number of full months worked in the calendar year in which Mr. Maddock's employment is terminated divided by twelve (the "Pro-Rated Short Term Plan Amount"); (2) payment of unpaid amounts under the Short Term Plan; (3) certain medical benefits, as described in the Maddock Agreement; (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs that were granted twelve (12) months or more before the termination date, in a pro rata amount; and (5) payment of amounts accrued under the Long Term Plans as of the date of termination.
In the event of Mr. Maddock's death or disability, he (or his estate) will be entitled to (1) the Pro-Rated Short Term Plan Amount; (2) payment of unpaid amounts under the Short Term Plan; (3) certain medical benefits (in the case of Mr. Maddock's death, benefits to which Mr. Maddock's dependents are entitled); (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs, in an amount equal to the greater of 50% of such awards or a pro rata amount; and (5) payment of amounts accrued under the Long Term Plans as of the date of termination.
In the event of any other termination of Mr. Maddock's employment during the term of the Maddock Agreement, Mr. Maddock will be entitled to payment of any earned but unpaid base salary, any accrued and unused vacation, and reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the business of the Company. If Mr. Maddock voluntarily resigns, he will be entitled to no additional benefits, any unvested stock options will be cancelled within 90 days of the date of termination unless earlier exercised, and any RSUs will be cancelled on the date of termination.
The Maddock Agreement subjects Mr. Maddock to customary confidentiality and non-competition obligations during the term of the Maddock Agreement, and non-solicitation obligations for a period of six months following the termination of his employment. The agreement also requires Mr. Maddock to execute a release in favor of the Company to receive the payments described above.

Change in Control Agreements
The Change in Control Agreements between the Company and Mr. Bultman, Dr. Hemker, and Ms. Kemble are new agreements.

The Change in Control Agreements provide that, if a "change in control" (as defined in the applicable Change in Control Agreement) of the Company occurs during the period of employment of the applicable executive officer under the Change in Control Agreement, and there is an "involuntary termination" (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) of the executive officer's employment either in contemplation of or within the 12 months following such change in control, the executive officer will be entitled to payments and benefits substantively similar to those contained in the change of control provisions of the Maddock Agreement.
The Change in Control Agreements contain confidentiality, non-competition, and non-solicitation terms which are substantively similar to those of the Maddock Agreementand require the executive officers to execute releases in favor of the Company to receive the payments described in the previous paragraph.

Exhibit 10.174
Ernest E. Maddock Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Ernest E. Maddock (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company.
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as a Senior Vice President and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") and Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's offices and positions.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on July 18, 2012, and ending on July 17, 2015 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The CEO will provide notice of the Company's intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the CEO provides notice of the Company's intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
3. .
Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $485,000. The Compensation Committee, at least annually, will review, and potentially adjust, such base salary on a prospective basis, reasonably taking into account Executive's performance and prevailing compensation for executives at similar levels in similar sized companies in the industry. Such salary shall be paid periodically in accordance with normal Company payroll. The annual compensation specified in this Section 3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Compensation."
Base Compensation
(b) . Executive shall be entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally (collectively, such plans are referred to in this Agreement as the "Combined Plans" and which are currently the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which includes the Multi-Year Incentive Plan and the equity components of the Long-Term Incentive Plan), subject to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determination of the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan.
Variable Compensation
(c) . The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.
Deferred Compensation
(d) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the benefit plans and compensation programs maintained by the Company of general applicability to other executive officers of the Company, including (without limitation) retirement plans, savings or profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement or excess-benefit plans, stock option, life, disability, health, accident and other insurance programs, paid vacations (but accruing at not less than three weeks per year), and similar plans or programs, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan or program in question and to the determination of the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan or program.
Benefits
(e) . The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
4. . Executive and the Company agree to use reasonable good faith efforts, to the extent reasonably practicable and not materially adverse to Executive, to structure payment of all amounts of Executive's compensation from the Company so as to avoid non-deductibility of any such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or any successor provision.
Section 162(m)
 
5. .
Benefits Upon a Change in Control
(a) If a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) occurs during the Employment Period, and an Involuntary Termination of Executive's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control
1
or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
2
, then:
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum equal to (A) twelve (12) months of Base Compensation (without giving effect to any salary reduction program then in effect), plus (B) an amount equal to the average of the short-term variable compensation plan (currently the Annual Incentive Plan, and for prior years the annual variable compensation plan called the "MBO", and together with any future short-term variable compensation plan, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Short Term Plan") payments earned by the Executive over the last five (5) years in which the Executive was employed with the Company on December 31
st
of such year (the "Five Year Average Amount"), plus (C) a pro-rata amount (based on the number of full months worked during the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs) of the Five Year Average Amount.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Company shall pay the Executive, not later than March 15
th
of the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the full amount he would have earned under such prior-year plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if his employment had not been terminated.
(iii) If the Executive qualifies for participation in the Company's Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, then the Executive will receive the benefits he qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan or, if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Executive qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
3
If the Executive does not qualify for participation in the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay in a lump sum any COBRA premiums the Executive would be required to pay for the COBRA benefits selected by Executive for twelve (12) months after the Executive's Termination Date.
 
 
 
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Executive prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date. Unless the grant was made prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. For options granted prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the grant's award agreement shall control its exercisability
4
. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs within ten (10) days of the Termination Date.
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which currently would include two Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Executive, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal, for each performance cycle under each plan, the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
(ii) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Executive shall receive the Payment Amounts when it is ordinarily paid out. For avoidance of doubt, if there are multiple Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles, portions of the Payment Amounts may be paid in different years, each in accordance with the terms of the relevant performance cycle.
Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
 
 
 
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).
i.e.
6. .
Severance Benefits other than in a Change in Control
(a) . In the event of any termination of Executive's employment at any time during the term of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall pay the Executive any unpaid Base Compensation due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (2) the Company shall pay the Executive all of the Executive's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (3) following submission of proper expense reports by the Executive (or his estate), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in connection with the business of the Company. These payments shall be made promptly at the Company's next scheduled payroll date.

(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Executive's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than: (A) any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally, or (B) unless in connection with a Change in Control, in which case this clause (B) shall not apply, any such reduction that is based on a good faith market review of executive compensation conditions and levels (for similar positions in comparable companies) conducted in accordance with the normal compensation evaluation process applicable to executive officers of the Company generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual Base Compensation (determined in the same manner as in Section 7(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits plus current annual target amounts under the Combined Plans, and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (FAS 123R) associated with that award;

The Company and the Executive shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.
(e) . "Change in Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:

Notice of Termination
10. .
Non-Compete; Non-Solicit
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 10 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.

The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator.

Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.

(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate
 
payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Exhibit 10.175
Richard A. Gottscho Employment Agreement
This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into between Richard A. Gottscho (the "Executive") and Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
A. The Company and Executive desire to enter into this Agreement with respect to the Executive's employment with the Company.
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, and in consideration of the employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:
1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
(a) . During the Employment Period (as defined in Section 2(a) below), the Executive shall serve as a Senior Vice President and in such capacity the Executive shall perform the duties and responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") and Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") may, from time to time, reasonably assign to Executive, in all cases to be consistent with Executive's offices and positions.
Position
(b) . Executive shall comply with all of the Company's policies and procedures governing employment. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall devote his full business efforts and time to the Company. The foregoing, however, shall not preclude the Executive from engaging in such activities and services as do not interfere or conflict with his responsibilities to the Company.
Executive's Obligations
2. .
Employment Period
(a) . The Company shall employ the Executive for the period commencing on July 18, 2012, and ending on July 17, 2015 (such period, the "Employment Period") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Term
(b) . This Agreement will terminate at the conclusion of the Employment Period unless the parties agree to extend it. The CEO will provide notice of the Company's intent whether to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive twelve (12) months prior to the end of the Employment Period. If the CEO provides notice of the Company's intent to renew or enter into a new employment agreement with the Executive, the Company and the Executive will enter into good faith negotiations. Neither (i) providing a notice of intent not to renew or enter into a new employment agreement nor (ii) the failure to renew or enter into a new employment agreement will be considered an Involuntary Termination as defined in Section 7(c). Nothing contained in this Agreement alters the "at will" nature of the Executive's employment with the Company. In addition, this Agreement may be terminated prior to expiration of the Employment Period as follows:
Termination
(i) . The Company may terminate the Executive's employment for Cause (as defined in Section 7(a) below), by giving the Executive thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.
Priority of Rights and Obligations upon Termination
 
3. .
Compensation and Benefits
(a) . During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for services a base salary at the annual rate of $438,000. The Compensation Committee, at least annually, will review, and potentially adjust, such base salary on a prospective basis, reasonably taking into account Executive's performance and prevailing compensation for executives at similar levels in similar sized companies in the industry. Such salary shall be paid periodically in accordance with normal Company payroll. The annual compensation specified in this Section 3(a) is referred to in this Agreement as "Base Compensation."
Base Compensation
(b) . Executive shall be entitled to participate in any short-term or long-term variable compensation plans offered by the Company to its executive officers generally (collectively, such plans are referred to in this Agreement as the "Combined Plans" and which are currently the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which includes the Multi-Year Incentive Plan and the equity components of the Long-Term Incentive Plan), subject to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan in question and to the determination of the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan.
Variable Compensation
(c) . The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Elective Deferred Compensation Plan pursuant to the terms thereof.
Deferred Compensation
(d) . During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be eligible to participate in the benefit plans and compensation programs maintained by the Company of general applicability to other executive officers of the Company, including (without limitation) retirement plans, savings or profit-sharing plans, deferred compensation plans, supplemental retirement or excess-benefit plans, stock option, life, disability, health, accident and other insurance programs, paid vacations (but accruing at not less than three weeks per year), and similar plans or programs, subject in each case to the generally applicable terms and conditions of the plan or program in question and to the determination of the Compensation Committee or any committee administering such plan or program.
Benefits
(e) . The Company shall reimburse the Executive for all reasonable and necessary business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder upon proper submission of expense reports in accordance with Company policies regarding such reimbursement.
Reimbursement of Business Expenses
4. . Executive and the Company agree to use reasonable good faith efforts, to the extent reasonably practicable and not materially adverse to Executive, to structure payment of all amounts of Executive's compensation from the Company so as to avoid non-deductibility of any such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or any successor provision.
Section 162(m)
 
5. .
Benefits Upon a Change in Control
(a) If a Change in Control (as defined in this Agreement) occurs during the Employment Period, and an Involuntary Termination of Executive's employment occurs either in contemplation of such Change in Control
1
or within twelve (12) months following a Change in Control
2
, then:
(i) Within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay Executive a lump sum equal to (A) twelve (12) months of Base Compensation (without giving effect to any salary reduction program then in effect), plus (B) an amount equal to the average of the short-term variable compensation plan (currently the Annual Incentive Plan, and for prior years the annual variable compensation plan called the "MBO", and together with any future short-term variable compensation plan, collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Short Term Plan") payments earned by the Executive over the last five (5) years in which the Executive was employed with the Company on December 31
st
of such year (the "Five Year Average Amount"), plus (C) a pro-rata amount (based on the number of full months worked during the calendar year during which the Termination Date occurs) of the Five Year Average Amount.
(ii) If at the Termination Date, payment has not been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the Company shall pay the Executive, not later than March 15
th
of the year in which the Termination Date occurs, the full amount he would have earned under such prior-year plan (based on the performance results achieved under such plan), as if his employment had not been terminated.
(iii) If the Executive qualifies for participation in the Company's Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, then the Executive will receive the benefits he qualifies for under the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan or, if such plan has been terminated prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay the Executive a lump sum amount (the "Medical Plan Payment") equal to the present value of the benefits for which the Executive qualified prior to the termination of such plan. The present value of such benefits shall be determined actuarially based on the actual cost of replacing the benefits as of the Termination Date.
3
If the Executive does not qualify for participation in the Executive Retiree Medical Benefit Plan prior to the Termination Date, within ten (10) days following the Termination Date, the Company shall pay in a lump sum any COBRA premiums the Executive would be required to pay for the COBRA benefits selected by Executive for twelve (12) months after the Executive's Termination Date.
 
 
(iv) The unvested portion(s) of any stock options/Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that were granted to Executive prior to the Change in Control shall automatically be accelerated in full so as to become completely vested as of the Termination Date. Unless the grant was made prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the stock options shall remain exercisable for two years following the Termination Date unless they are earlier exercised or expire pursuant to their original terms or unless they are exchanged for cash in connection with any Change in Control. For options granted prior to the effective date of this Agreement, the grant's award agreement shall control its exercisability
4
. The Company will issue the shares underlying the RSUs within ten (10) days of the Termination Date.
(b) In the event of a Change in Control, for any long-term cash-based variable compensation plan (currently the Multi-Year Incentive Plan, and together with any future long-term cash-based variable compensation plan, hereinafter the "Long Term Cash Plan") awards outstanding (which currently would include two Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles) at the time of the Change in Control, performance cycles under such plans shall cease as of the date of the Change in Control. The Company shall pay Executive, subject to the payout dates and restrictions below, all accrued amounts as of the last full completed quarter as of the date of the Change in Control, under each performance cycle of such plan, plus the Remaining Target Amount for each performance cycle under each such plan (together, the "Payment Amounts"). The Remaining Target Amount shall equal, for each performance cycle under each plan, the target amount multiplied by the number of quarters in the performance cycle that end after the time of the Change in Control, divided by the total number of quarters in the full performance cycle. Payment shall be made at the times specified below, and pending payment, the Company shall hold such amount in a book account for the Executive.
(i) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment terminates due to an Involuntary Termination prior to twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Payment Amounts shall be paid out to the Executive within ten (10) days following the Termination Date.
Change in Control, Involuntary Termination
(ii) . In the case of a Change in Control where the Executive's employment does not terminate within twelve (12) months following the Change in Control or in contemplation of a Change in Control, the Executive shall receive the Payment Amounts when it is ordinarily paid out. For avoidance of doubt, if there are multiple Long Term Cash Plan performance cycles, portions of the Payment Amounts may be paid in different years, each in accordance with the terms of the relevant performance cycle.
Change in Control, No Termination
(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
 
 
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.
(e) These Section 5 benefits upon a Change in Control shall be the sole benefits that the Executive is entitled to under this Agreement (, the Executive is not also entitled to any additional benefits provided in Section 6(b), below).
i.e.
6. .
Severance Benefits other than in a Change in Control

In the event of any termination of Executive's employment at any time during the term of this Agreement, (1) the Company shall pay the Executive any unpaid Base Compensation due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (2) the Company shall pay the Executive all of the Executive's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (3) following submission of proper expense reports by the Executive (or his estate), the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in connection with the business of the Company.

7. . The following terms referred to in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:
Definition of Terms
(a) . "Cause" shall mean: (1) Executive's willful and continued failure to perform the duties and responsibilities of his position after there has been delivered to Executive a written demand for performance from the Board which describes the basis for the Board's belief that Executive has not substantially performed his duties and responsibilities and provides Executive with thirty (30) days to take corrective action; (2) Any act of personal dishonesty knowingly taken by Executive in connection with his responsibilities as an employee of the Company with the intention or reasonable expectation that such action may result in substantial financial enrichment of Executive; (3) Executive's conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony; (4) a willful and knowing act by the executive which constitutes gross misconduct; or (5) A willful breach of a material provision of this Agreement by the Executive. Termination for Cause shall not be deemed to have occurred unless, by the affirmative vote of all of the members of the Board (excluding the Executive and any person who reports to the Executive, if applicable), at a meeting called and held for that purpose (after reasonable notice to the Executive and his counsel and after allowing the Executive and his counsel to be heard before the Board), a resolution is adopted finding that in the good faith opinion of such Board members the Executive was guilty of conduct set forth in (1), (2), (3), (4) or (5) of this Section 7(a), specifying the particulars thereof.
Cause
(b) . "Disability" shall mean that the Executive is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reasons of any readily determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuing period of not less than twelve (12) months.

Disability
 
(c) . "Involuntary Termination" shall mean:

(ii) a material reduction in the Executive's Base Compensation and benefits package, other than a reduction in Base Compensation which is part of, and generally consistent with, a general reduction of salaries of all executive officers of the Company and of any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control, or other than a change in Executive's benefits package that continues to provide Executive with comparable benefits to those enjoyed prior to the change;
(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Executive's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than: (A) any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally, or (B) unless in connection with a Change in Control, in which case this clause (B) shall not apply, any such reduction that is based on a good faith market review of executive compensation conditions and levels (for similar positions in comparable companies) conducted in accordance with the normal compensation evaluation process applicable to executive officers of the Company generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual Base Compensation (determined in the same manner as in Section 7(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits plus current annual target amounts under the Combined Plans, and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (FAS 123R) associated with that award;
(iv) the relocation of the Company's principal executive office to a location more than fifty (50) miles from its present location but only if the Executive is required to change his principal place of employment to such new location;

subject to the following: (A) None of the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination if the Executive has agreed thereto. (B) The CEO providing notice of the Company's intent not to enter into, renew or extend this Agreement pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof shall not be considered an Involuntary Termination (although any of the foregoing actions which occurs after the CEO provides notice of the Company's intent not to enter into, renew or extend this Agreement may constitute an Involuntary Termination). (C) Except with respect to an event described in Section 7(c)(v), the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination
 
only if and to the extent that (x) within 90 days of the occurrence of the events giving rise to an Involuntary Termination, the Executive provides written notice to the Company setting forth in reasonable detail such facts which Executive believes constitute Involuntary Termination, (y) any circumstances constituting Involuntary Termination remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following the Company's receipt of such written notice, and (z) the Termination Date occurs within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the initial existence of the event giving rise to an Involuntary Termination.
(d) . "Termination Date" shall mean:
Termination Date
(i) In the case of a termination for Cause, the last day of the thirty (30) day notice period, unless the reason for such termination is cured by the Executive prior to the end of the thirty (30) day period;

(iii) In the case of the Executive's Voluntary Resignation or of an Involuntary Termination initiated by the Executive (each under Section 2(b)(ii) of this Agreement), the last day of the applicable notice period required under such section, or such earlier date at which the Company waives notice and pays the Executive in lieu of such notice;
(iv) In the case of Executive's death, the date of such death; and
(v) In the case of Executive's Disability, the date of such Disability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Involuntary Termination occuring in contemplation of a Change in Control, if the Termination Date would otherwise have occurred prior to the Change in Control, the Termination Date shall take place on the date of the Change in Control. If more than one Termination Date may apply, then the priority provisions of Section 2(e) of this Agreement shall determine which Termination Date controls. The Company and the Executive shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.

Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique and that his level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on his part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 10 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.

The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known.
 
The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate
 
payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be
Company Release
Exhibit A
 
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement.

Definition of Terms

(b) . "Disability" shall mean that the Executive is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reasons of any readily determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuing period of not less than twelve (12) months.

(iii) a material reduction by the Company in the Executive's current Target Total Direct Compensation, other than any such reduction applicable to all executive officers of the Company and any party acquiring control of the Company in a Change in Control generally. For purposes of the foregoing, Target Total Direct Compensation means current annual base salary (determined in the same manner as in Section 5(c)(ii)) plus current annual benefits plus current annual target amounts under the Combined Plans, and to the extent that Target Direct Compensation includes equity awards, the value of such equity shall be determined at the time of grant based on the total stock compensation expense (FAS 123R) associated with that award;
(iv) the relocation of the Company's principal executive office to a location more than fifty (50) miles from its present location but only if the Executive is required to change Executive's principal place of employment to such new location;

(B) Except with respect to an event described in Section 5(c)(v), the foregoing actions shall constitute Involuntary Termination only if and to the extent that (x) within 90 days of the occurrence of the events giving rise to an Involuntary Termination, the Executive provides written notice to the Company setting forth in reasonable detail such facts which Executive believes constitute Involuntary Termination, (y) any circumstances constituting Involuntary Termination remain uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following the Company's receipt of such written notice, and (z) the Termination Date occurs within one hundred and eighty (180) days following the initial existence of the event giving rise to an Involuntary Termination.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of an Involuntary Termination occuring in contemplation of a Change in Control, if the Termination Date would otherwise have occurred prior to the Change in Control, the Termination Date shall take place on the date of the Change in Control. The Company and the Executive shall take all steps necessary to ensure that any termination described in this Agreement constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the date on which such separation from service takes place shall be the Termination Date.

Notice of Termination
8.
Non-Compete; Non-Solicit.
(a) The parties hereto recognize that the Executive's services are special and unique and that Executive's level of compensation and the provisions herein for compensation upon Involuntary Termination are partly in consideration of and conditioned upon the Executive's not competing with the Company, and that the covenant on Executive's part not to compete and not to solicit as set forth in this Section 8 is essential to protect the business and goodwill of the Company.
(b) The Executive agrees that prior to the Termination Date, the Executive will not either directly or indirectly, whether as a director, officer, consultant, employee or advisor or in any other capacity (1) render any planning, marketing or other services respecting the creation, design, manufacture or sale of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and/or software to any business, agency, partnership or entity ("Restricted Business") other than the Company, or (2) make or hold any investment in any Restricted Business in the United States other than the Company, whether such investment be by way of loan, purchase of stock or otherwise, provided that there shall be excluded from the foregoing the ownership of not more than 2% of the listed or traded stock of any publicly held corporation. For purposes of this Section 8, the term "Company" shall mean and include the Company, any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, any Successor Company and any other corporation or entity of which the Executive may serve as a director, officer or employee at the request of the Company or any Successor Company.

(d) The Executive agrees that the Company would suffer an irreparable injury if Executive were to breach the covenants contained in subparagraphs (b) or (c) and that the Company would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Executive hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
(e) If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 8 shall be deemed to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope or other provisions thereof, then the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provisions hereof (but only to the extent necessary to render such restrictions enforceable) and then enforce this Section 8 in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.
9. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments

Miscellaneous Provisions

(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.

(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the continued enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously executed by the Executive, or any indemnification agreement between Executive and the Company. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection 10(f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 10(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 10(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 10(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or
Section 409A of the Code
provided
 
before March 15
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . This Agreement shall expire on July 17, 2015, unless prior to the first such date to occur, the Company enters an Acquisition Agreement, in which case this Agreement shall remain in effect in connection with such Change in Control. Further, in the event that a reduction in Executive's salary grade occurs in contemplation of a Change in Control, this Agreement shall remain in effect in connection with that Change in Control.
Term
(l) . At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
Arbitration
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
 
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for Executive's reasonable attorney's fees to the extent Executive prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.

Lam Research Corporation Reports Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 23, 2012
 
 
 
 
FREMONT, Calif., October 17, 2012Lam Research Corporation's (NASDAQ: LRCX) highlights for the September 2012 quarter were:
 
Lam Research Corporation today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 23, 2012. Revenue for the period was $906.9 million, gross margin was $333.9 million, or 36.8%, operating expenses were $317.2 million, and net income was $2.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to revenue of $741.8 million, gross margin of $298.2 million, or 40.2%, operating expenses of $265.5 million, and net income of $18.1 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the June 2012 quarter. Shipments for the September 2012 quarter were $935 million compared to $816 million during the June 2012 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the September 2012 and June 2012 quarters exclude costs associated with acquisition-related inventory fair value impact, amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, certain acquisition and integration-related costs, the amortization of convertible note discounts, and rationalization of certain product configurations. See "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information.
Non-GAAP net income was $97.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the September 2012 quarter compared to non-GAAP net income of $80.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the June 2012 quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin for the September 2012 quarter was $402.3 million, or 44.4%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of $312.7 million, or 42.1%, for the June 2012 quarter. Gross margin performance reflected solid execution combined with more favorable customer and product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the September 2012 quarter increased to $284.3 million compared with the June quarter of $214.8 million primarily reflecting a full quarter of post-acquisition activity as a combined company.
"Despite a more uncertain industry environment, Lam Research achieved strong financial performance in the September quarter, delivering gross margin and operating profits above the high end of our guidance," said Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "Our results reflect strong operational execution and solid progress towards the synergy targets that we've outlined. While the near-term outlook for semiconductor equipment demand has softened, we are committed to achieving the appropriate balance between cost management and continued investment in next-generation solutions for our customers. We believe that these activities will drive profitable growth for Lam when industry conditions improve," Anstice concluded.
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances decreased to $2.9 billion at the end of the September 2012 quarter, compared to $3.0 billion at the end of the June 2012 quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of stock repurchases during the quarter, offset by cash flows from operating activities, which were approximately $249 million during the September 2012 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the September 2012 quarter increased to $363.5 million and $208.1 million, respectively, as compared to $335.4 million and $164.8 million, respectively, at the end of the June 2012 quarter. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $20.7 million as of September 23, 2012.
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the September 2012 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.

Lam Research Corporation Reports Financial Results for the Quarter Ended December 23, 2012
 
 
 
 
FREMONT, Calif., January 23, 2013Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 23, 2012. Highlights for the quarter were as follows:
 
Revenue for the period was $860.9 million, gross margin was $315.4 million, or 36.6% of revenue, operating expenses were $311.4 million, and net income was $6.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. This compares to revenue of $906.9 million, gross margin of $333.9 million, or 36.8%, operating expenses of $317.2 million, and net income of $2.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the September 2012 quarter. Shipments for the December 2012 quarter were $803 million, compared to $935 million during the September 2012 quarter.
In addition to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results, this commentary contains non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the December 2012 and September 2012 quarters exclude costs associated with the fair value impact of acquisition-related inventory, amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, certain acquisition and integration-related costs, the amortization of convertible note discounts, and rationalization of certain product configurations. Additionally, the December 2012 quarter non-GAAP results exclude restructuring charges and tax benefits on successful resolution of certain tax matters. See "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $77.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the December 2012 quarter compared to $97.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the September 2012 quarter. Gross margin for the December 2012 quarter was $380.5 million, or 44.2%, compared to $402.3 million, or 44.4%, for the September 2012 quarter. Gross margin performance reflected unfavorable factory utilization as well as product and customer-mix changes. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the December 2012 quarter decreased to $281.5 million compared with the September quarter of $284.3 million. This was primarily due to lower incentive compensation stemming from decreased business volumes and reductions in field and support-group spending.
"Lam closed calendar year 2012 by delivering solid financial performance for the December quarter and strong execution against our integration plans," stated Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "In the latter part of 2012, demand for semiconductor equipment declined, particularly in the NAND memory segment. Although we expect these conditions will continue in the near-term we remain optimistic in the long-term about the catalysts and inflections for growth. In this environment, we remain committed to funding new technology investments and positioning next-generation products with customers, and at the same time, retaining day-to-day discipline necessary to deliver predictable operating performance."
 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investment balances decreased to $2.7 billion as planned at the end of the December 2012 quarter, compared to $2.9 billion at the end of the September 2012 quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of approximately $355 million of stock repurchases, offset by approximately $193 million in cash flow from operating activities during the December 2012 quarter. Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the December 2012 quarter decreased to $282.0 million and $169.0 million, respectively, as compared to $363.5 million and $208.1 million, respectively, at the end of the September 2012 quarter. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $45.7 million as of December 23, 2012.
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the December 2012 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.

In the event that Mr. Bettinger's employment terminates within the first year of the employment period for any reason other than a voluntary resignation or a termination for "cause" (as defined in the Agreement), the unvested portion of all RSUs shall accelerate their vesting as of the termination date.
Table of Contents

st
of such year (the "Short Term Plan Average"), plus a pro rata amount of the Short Term Plan Average for such calendar year; (2) if as of the termination date, payment has not yet been made under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year, payment of any amounts under the Short Term Plan that was in effect during the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which he was terminated which Mr. Bettinger would have earned (based on the performance results achieved under the plan) if his employment had not been terminated; (3) a lump sum amount equal to twelve months of COBRA premiums; (4) vesting, as of the date of termination, of the unvested portions of any stock option or restricted stock unit awards granted to Mr. Bettinger prior to the change in control, and issuance of shares underlying any RSUs within 10 days of the date of termination with generally a two year exercise period applicable to any stock options; and (5) payment of any amounts accrued as of the last full completed quarter as of the change in control under any long-term cash-based variable compensation plans of the Company (the "Long Term Plans"), plus an amount equal to the remaining target amount under the Long Term Plans.

In the event of Mr. Bettinger's death or disability, he (or his estate) will be entitled to (1) the Pro-Rated Short Term Plan Amount; (2) payment of unpaid amounts under the Short Term Plan; (3) a lump sum amount equal to twelve months of COBRA premiums; (4) vesting of any unvested stock options or RSUs, in an amount equal to the greater of 50% of such awards or a pro rata amount; and (5) payment of amounts accrued under the Long Term Plans as of the date of termination.
In the event of any other termination of Mr. Bettinger's employment during the term of the Agreement, Mr. Bettinger will be entitled to payment of any earned but unpaid base salary, any accrued and unused vacation, and reimbursement for any expenses incurred in connection with the business of the Company. If Mr. Bettinger voluntarily resigns, he will be entitled to no additional benefits, any unvested stock options will be cancelled within 90 days of the date of termination unless earlier exercised, and any RSUs will be cancelled on the date of termination.
The Agreement subjects Mr. Bettinger to customary confidentiality and non-competition obligations during the term of the Agreement, and non-solicitation obligations for a period of six months following the termination of his employment.

The Company may terminate the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason (other than due to the Executive's death or Disability, which are addressed in Sections 2(c) and 2(d) below) by giving the Executive ninety (90) days' advance notice in writing, although the Company may pay to the Executive the compensation Executive would have otherwise received during such period in lieu of such notice. Unless such termination by the Company is a termination for Cause or due to the Executive's death or Disability, it shall be regarded as an Involuntary Termination of the Executive. Any waiver of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Company
(ii) . The Executive may terminate his employment with the Company by reason of Involuntary Termination (as defined in Section 7(c) below) by giving the Company thirty (30) days' advance written notice, subject, however, to the cure provisions of such Section. The Executive may tender his Voluntary Resignation (as defined in this Agreement) by giving the Company ninety (90) days' advance written notice, which period may be waived or reduced at the Company's option, although the Company may choose to pay the Executive, in lieu of such notice period the amounts that would otherwise be due to the Executive during such period. Any waiver or reduction of notice shall be valid only if it is made in writing and expressly refers to the applicable notice requirement of this Section 2(b).
By the Executive
(c) . The Executive's employment shall terminate immediately in the event of his death.
Death
(d) . The Executive's employment shall terminate in the event of his Disability (as defined in Section 7(b) below).
Disability
(e) . If any event leading to or permitting termination of this Agreement, or providing notice thereof, occurs at approximately the same time as any other termination event or during any termination notice period, and those events invoke different notice periods or different severance or other benefit arrangements, the deadlines, obligations, rights and benefits applicable to the termination event having the highest priority shall control. The priority of termination events (from highest to lowest priority) is as follows: (1) termination for Cause; (2) Voluntary Resignation; (3) Involuntary Termination; (4) Disability; and (5) death. For example, if Executive gives notice of his Voluntary Resignation and, before the 90 day notice period has expired, he is subject to an Involuntary Termination, only the rights and benefits available to him for Voluntary Resignation apply since the provisions governing Voluntary Resignation have a higher priority than those applicable to Involuntary Termination. Similarly, if the Executive has been subject to an Involuntary Termination and dies during the notice period, he shall have the rights and benefits available to his estate as one subject to an Involuntary Termination. Expiration of this Agreement prevails over all termination events.

(c) No Change in Control benefits under Sections 5(a) or 5(b) will apply if the Change in Control or Involuntary Termination occurs after the Executive has (i) given notice of Voluntary Resignation or (ii) been given notice of termination for Cause by the Company, unless that notice of termination for Cause is subsequently withdrawn (in writing) by the Company and Executive's employment does not terminate as a result of such notice.
(d) If the Company is acquired by another entity in connection with a Change in Control and there is or will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company, the vesting of all Executive's stock options/RSUs, granted prior to the Change in Control, will accelerate immediately prior to the Change in Control (and, for stock options, be immediately exercisable) if the acquiring company does not provide Executive with stock options/RSUs comparable to the unvested stock options/RSUs granted Executive by the Company, regardless of whether the Executive's employment is terminated.

would by reason of such breach or threatened breach be entitled to injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, and the Executive hereby stipulates to the entering of such injunctive relief prohibiting him from engaging in such breach.
(e) If any of the restrictions contained in this Section 10 shall be deemed to be unenforceable by reason of the extent, duration or geographical scope or other provisions thereof, then the parties hereto contemplate that the court shall reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope or other provisions hereof (but only to the extent necessary to render such restrictions enforceable) and then enforce this Section 10 in its reduced form for all purposes in the manner contemplated hereby.
11. .

Executive represents and warrants (1) that prior to the date hereof he has provided the Company with true and complete copies of any and all written confidentiality and/or non-compete agreements to which Executive is a party as of the date hereof (together with a written description of any such oral agreements), and (2) to the best of Executive's knowledge, full compliance with the terms of each such agreement will not materially interfere with Executive's duties hereunder (except to the extent that Executive reasonably may determine to absent himself from certain Company meetings and communication during the first year of the Employment Period). The Executive further covenants that he will not willfully and knowingly fail to fully abide by the terms of any and all such agreements and will work in good faith with the Company to avoid any breach thereof.
12. .
Arbitration
At the option of either party, any and all disputes or controversies whether of law or fact and of any nature whatsoever arising from or respecting this Agreement shall be decided by arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and regulations of that Association with the exception of any claim for temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief arising from or respecting this Agreement which may be brought by the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction irrespective of Executive's desire to arbitrate such a claim.
The arbitrator shall be selected as follows. In the event the Company and the Executive agree on one arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted by such arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the Company and the Executive shall each select one independent, qualified arbitrator and the two arbitrators so selected shall select the third arbitrator. The Company reserves the right to object to any individual arbitrator who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization.
Arbitration shall take place in San Jose, California, or any other location mutually agreeable to the parties. At the request of either party, arbitration proceedings will be conducted in the utmost secrecy; in such case all documents, testimony and records shall be received, heard and maintained by the arbitrators in secrecy under seal, available for the inspection only by the Company and the Executive and their respective attorneys and their respective experts who shall agree in advance and in writing to receive all such information confidentially and to maintain
 
such information in secrecy unless and until such information shall become generally known. The arbitrator, who, if more than one, shall act by majority vote, shall have the power and authority to decree any and all relief of an equitable nature including, but not limited to, such relief as a temporary restraining order, a temporary and/or permanent injunction, and shall also have the power and authority to award damages, with or without an accounting and costs, provided, that punitive damages shall not be awarded, and provided, further, that the Executive shall be entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable attorney's fees to the extent he prevails as to the material issues in such dispute. The reimbursement of attorney's fees shall be made promptly following delivery of an invoice therefor. The decree or judgment of an award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Reasonable notice of the time and place of arbitration shall be given to all persons, other than the parties, as shall be required by law, in which case such persons or those authorized representatives shall have the right to attend and/or participate in all the arbitration hearings in such a manner as the law shall require.
13. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that any payment by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive, whether paid or payable, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any comparable federal, state, or local excise tax (such excise tax, together with any interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive shall receive either the full severance amount or a lesser amount that does not trigger an excise tax, whichever produces a greater after-tax benefit to the Executive, as determined by the Company.
Excise Tax on Payments
14. .
Miscellaneous Provisions
(a) . The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Executive may receive from any other source.
No Duty to Mitigate
(b) . No provisions of this Agreement shall be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by the Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than the Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.
Waiver
(c) . This Agreement and the documents expressly referred to herein represent the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the matters set forth herein. This Agreement may not be altered, modified, or amended except by written instrument signed by the parties hereto. Nothing herein affects the enforceability of either the Company's Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement with the Executive or the Executive's Indemnification Agreement with the Company, both of which the Executive will execute upon commencement of employment. Any benefit amounts referenced as payable to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement are the sole and exclusive amounts payable to the Executive for the category of benefit addressed by such
Whole Agreement; Amendment
 
amounts; provided, however, that this Agreement shall not limit any right of Executive to receive any payments or benefits under an employee benefit or employee compensation plan of the Company, initially adopted prior to or after the date hereof, which are expressly contingent thereunder upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (including, but not limited to, the acceleration of any rights or benefits thereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Executive be entitled to any payment or benefit under this Agreement which duplicates a payment or benefit received or receivable by Executive under any severance or similar plan or policy of Company, and in any such case Executive shall only be entitled to receive the greater of the two payments.
(d) . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof.
Choice of Law
(e) . If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining provisions, and the parties shall replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with one which reflects the parties' original intent in agreeing to the invalid/unenforceable one.
Severability
(f) . Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights of any person to payments or benefits under this Agreement shall not be made subject to option or assignment, either by voluntary or involuntary assignment or by operation of law, including (without limitation) bankruptcy, garnishment, attachment or other creditor's process, and any action in violation of this subsection (f) shall be void.
No Assignment of Benefits
(g) . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement such Federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.
Withholding Taxes
(h) . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company has determined that the Executive is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code and any severance payments and benefits to Executive are considered a "deferral of compensation" under Section 409A of the Code (the "Deferred Payments"), such Deferred Payments that are otherwise payable within the first six months following the Termination Date will become payable on the first business day of the seventh month following the Executive's Termination Date, or if earlier the date of the Executive's death. In the event that payments under this Agreement are deferred pursuant to this Section 14(h), then such payments shall be paid at the time specified in this Section 14(h) without interest. The Company shall consult with the Executive in good faith regarding the implementation of the provisions of this Section 14(h) , that neither the Company nor any of its employees or representatives shall have any liability to the Executive with respect thereto. Any amount under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the "short-term deferral" rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of this Agreement. Any amounts scheduled for payment hereunder when they are ordinarily paid out or when they are made to other executive officers, will nonetheless be paid to Executive on or before March 15
Section 409A of the Code
provided
th
of the year following the year when the payment is no longer subject to a
 
substantial risk of forfeiture. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments, and references herein to the Executive's termination of employment shall refer to Executive's separation of services with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except to the extent any expense, reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute a "deferral of compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code: (x) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive during any calendar year will not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or in-kind benefits provided to the Executive in any other calendar year, (y) the reimbursements for expenses for which the Executive is entitled to be reimbursed shall be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the applicable expense is incurred, and (z) the right to payment or reimbursement or in-kind benefits hereunder may not be liquidated or exchanged for any other benefit.
(i) . The Company may assign its rights under this Agreement to an affiliate, and an affiliate may assign its rights under this Agreement to another affiliate of the Company or to the Company, provided, however, that no assignment shall be made if the net worth of the assignee is less than the net worth of the Company at the time of assignment. In the case of any such assignment, the term "Company" when used in a section of this Agreement shall mean the corporation that actually employs the Executive.
Assignment by Company
(j) . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
(k) . Except as otherwise described herein, and except to the extent that as of the Termination Date rights to payment hereunder have accrued, the obligations of Sections 7 through 14 shall survive termination of this Agreement. In the event that a binding agreement is reached that would result in a Change in Control during the Employment Period, Section 5 of this Agreement shall survive with regard to that Change in Control.
Survival of Obligations
(l) . As a condition to the Company's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute a release of claims against the Company (the "Release"), substantially in the form attached hereto as , by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Executive's Termination Date. If the Company has not received an irrevocable Release by the sixtieth (60th) day following the Termination Date, the Company shall be under no obligation to make payments or provide benefits under this Agreement; provided such sixty (60) day period shall be tolled during the pendancy of any arbitration proceeding under this Agreement. In the event one or more of the provisions of the Release should, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of the Release, and the Release shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained therein.

Lam Research Corporation Reports Financial Results for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2013
FREMONT, Calif., April 24, 2013Lam Research Corp. (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. Highlights for the quarter were as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GAAP Financial Results
Revenue for the period was $844.9 million, gross margin was $339.8 million, or 40.2% of revenue, operating expenses were $329.0 million, and net income was $19.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. This compares to revenue of $860.9 million, gross margin of $315.4 million, or 36.6% of revenue, operating expenses of $311.4 million, and net income of $6.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the December 2012 quarter.
Non-GAAP Financial Results
Non-GAAP gross margin was $370.7 million, or 43.9% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses were $296.0 million, and non-GAAP net income was $74.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP gross margin of $380.5 million, or 44.2% of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses of $281.5 million, and non-GAAP net income of $77.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the December 2012 quarter.
"Lam delivered solid March quarter results, which underscore our ability to execute well as a newly integrated company," stated Martin Anstice, Lam's president and chief executive officer. "We are off to a great start this year and continue to make progress against our multi-year growth strategic plan by building upon our technology leadership in key product areas and further strengthening our competitive differentiation."
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Results
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash and investment balances decreased to $2.5 billion at the end of the March 2013 quarter, as planned, compared to $2.7 billion at the end of the December 2012 quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of approximately $243 million of stock repurchases, offset by approximately $102 million in cash flow from operating activities during the March 2013 quarter.
Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances at the end of the March 2013 quarter increased to $326.6 million and $193.3 million, respectively, as compared to $282.0 million and $169.0 million, respectively, at the end of the December 2012 quarter. Lam's deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to Japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. Shipments to Japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of acceptance. The anticipated future revenue from shipments to Japanese customers was approximately $49.9 million as of March 31, 2013.
Geographic Distribution
The geographic distribution of shipments and revenue during the March 2013 quarter is shown in the following table:
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results
In addition to U.S. GAAP results, this commentary also contains non-GAAP financial results. The Company's non-GAAP results for both the March 2013 and December 2012 quarters exclude costs associated with the fair value impact of acquisition-related inventory, amortization related to intangible assets acquired in the Novellus transaction, certain integration-related costs, the amortization of convertible note discounts, and rationalization of certain product configurations. Additionally, the March 2013 quarter non-GAAP results exclude the impairment of an investment, tax benefit on reinstatement of R&D tax credit, and tax expense associated with legal entity integration, and the December 2012 quarter non-GAAP results exclude restructuring charges and tax benefits from the successful resolution of certain tax matters.
Management uses non-GAAP gross margin, operating income, operating expenses, operating margin, net income, and net income per diluted share to evaluate the Company's operating and financial results. The Company believes the presentation of non-GAAP results is useful to investors for analyzing business trends and comparing performance to prior periods, along with enhancing the investors' ability to view the Company's results from management's perspective. Tables presenting reconciliations of non-GAAP results to U.S. GAAP results are included at the end of this press release and on the Company's web site at http://investor.lamresearch.com.

Exhibit 3.2
1.1
REGISTERED OFFICE
The registered office of the corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware. The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is The Corporation Trust Company.
1.2
OTHER OFFICES
The board of directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
2.1
PLACE OF MEETINGS
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the registered office of the Corporation.
2.2
ANNUAL MEETING
(a) An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, on such date, and at such time as the board of directors shall each year fix.
(b) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors and the proposal of business to be transacted by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (1) pursuant to the corporation's proxy materials with respect to such meeting, (2) by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (3) by any stockholder of record of the corporation (the "Record Stockholder") at the time of the giving of the notice required in the following paragraph, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this section. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing clause (3) shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or propose business (other than business included in the corporation's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (such act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) at an annual meeting of stockholders.
(c) For nominations or business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a Record Stockholder pursuant to clause (3) of the foregoing paragraph, (1) the Record Stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation, (2) any such business must be a proper matter for stockholder action under Delaware law and (3) the Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made, must have acted in accordance with the representations set forth in the Solicitation Statement required by these bylaws. To be timely, a Record Stockholder's notice shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than 45 or more than 75 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that, subject to the last sentence of this Section 2.2(c), if the meeting is convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the Record Stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day before such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors is increased and there has been no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or indicating the increase in the size of the board of directors made by the corporation at least 10 days before the last day a Record Stockholder may deliver a notice of nomination in accordance with the preceding sentence, a Record Stockholder's notice required by this bylaw shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of an annual meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a Record Stockholder's notice.
(d) Such Record Stockholder's notice shall set forth:
1. if such notice pertains to the nomination of directors, as to each person whom the Record Stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of such nominees as directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, such person's written consent to serve as a director if elected, and a statement whether such person, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's election or re-election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the board of directors, in accordance with the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines;
 
2. as to any business that the Record Stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of such business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such Record Stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and
3. as to (1) the Record Stockholder giving the notice and (2) the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (each, a "party"):
(i) the name and address of each such party;
(ii)(A) the class, series, and number of shares of the corporation that are owned, directly or indirectly, beneficially and of record by each such party, (B) any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation right, or similar right with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to any class or series of shares of the corporation or with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of any class or series of shares of the corporation, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in the underlying class or series of capital stock of the corporation or otherwise (a "Derivative Instrument") directly or indirectly owned beneficially by each such party, and any other direct or indirect opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation, (C) any proxy, contract, arrangement, understanding, or relationship pursuant to which either party has a right to vote, directly or indirectly, any shares of any security of the corporation, (D) any short interest in any security of the corporation held by each such party (for purposes of this Section 2.2(d), a person shall be deemed to have a short interest in a security if such person directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has the opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from any decrease in the value of the subject security), (E) any rights to dividends on the shares of the corporation owned beneficially directly or indirectly by each such party that are separated or separable from the underlying shares of the corporation, (F) any proportionate interest in shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments held, directly or indirectly, by a general or limited partnership in which either party is a general partner or, directly or indirectly, beneficially owns an interest in a general partner and (G) any performance-related fees (other than an asset-based fee) that each such party is directly or indirectly entitled to based on any increase or decrease in the value of shares of the corporation or Derivative Instruments, if any, as of the date of such notice, including without limitation any such interests held by members of each such party's immediate family sharing the same household (which information set forth in this paragraph shall be supplemented by such stockholder or such
 
beneficial owner, as the case may be, not later than ten (10) days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, that if such date is after the date of the meeting, not later than the day prior to the meeting);
(iii) any other information relating to each such party that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and
(iv) a statement whether or not each such party will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of, in the case of a proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation required under applicable law to carry the proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of capital stock of the corporation reasonably believed by the Record Stockholder or beneficial holder, as the case may be, to be sufficient to elect the nominee or nominees proposed to be nominated by the Record Stockholder (such statement, a "Solicitation Statement").
(e) A person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director at an annual meeting unless (i) the person is nominated by a Record Stockholder in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(3) or (ii) the person is nominated by or at the direction of the board of directors. Only such business shall be conducted at an annual meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section. The chairman of the meeting shall have the power and the duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting has been made in accordance with the procedures set forth in these bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these bylaws, to declare that such defectively proposed business or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.
(f) For purposes of these bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.2. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
 
2.3
SPECIAL MEETING
(a) Special meetings of the stockholders, other than those required by statute, may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board or the president. The board of directors may postpone or reschedule any previously scheduled special meeting.
(b) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors. The notice of such special meeting shall include the purpose for which the meeting is called. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (1) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (2) by any stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this paragraph, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who delivers a written notice to the secretary setting forth the information set forth in Section 2.2(d)(1) and 2.2(d)(3) of this Article II. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the board of directors may be made at such a special meeting of stockholders only if such stockholder of record's notice required by the preceding sentence shall be received by the secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall an adjournment, or postponement of a special meeting for which notice has been given, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder of record's notice. A person shall not be eligible for election or reelection as a director at a special meeting unless the person is nominated (i) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (ii) by a stockholder of record in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Article II.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 2.3. Nothing in this Section 2.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
2.4
NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS
All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except as otherwise required by these bylaws, the certificate of incorporation or the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
 
2.5
MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
2.6
QUORUM
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
2.7
ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.8
VOTING
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). Each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. The board of directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in his discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
 
A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election (with abstentions and "broker non-votes" not counted as votes cast either for or against such nominee's election); provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders at which (i) the number of nominees for the board exceeds the number of open board seats; (ii) one or more nominees has been nominated pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees set forth in these bylaws or pursuant to the provisions of any future law, rule or regulation that require the Corporation to allow stockholder nominations in a manner other than that provided in these bylaws; and (iii) any such nomination has not been withdrawn on or before the tenth day before the Corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting (other than director elections), unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the statutes or of the Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
2.9
WAIVER OF NOTICE
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
2.10
STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors, and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the secretary, request the board of directors to fix a record date. The board of directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded, to the attention of the secretary of the corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
In the event of the delivery to the corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to authorize or take corporate action and/or related revocations (each such written consent and any revocation thereof is referred to in this Section 2.10 as a "Consent"), the secretary of the corporation shall provide for the safekeeping of such Consents and shall as soon as practicable thereafter conduct such reasonable investigation as he deems necessary or appropriate for the purpose of ascertaining the validity of such Consents and all matters incident thereto, including, without limitation, whether the holders of shares having the requisite voting power to authorize or take the action specified in the Consents have given consents. No consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be effective unless delivered to the corporation within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the corporation.
 
2.11
RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING
Except as otherwise permitted by law, in order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall be not more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
(i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
(ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
2.12
PROXIES
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
2.13
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders
 
entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the 10th day before the meeting date. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, in the manner provided by law. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.
2.14
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS
The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business.
2.15 ORGANIZATION
Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chairman of the board or, in his or her absence, the president of the Corporation or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the Corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints. Whether or not a quorum is present or represented at any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn such meeting to another place, date and time.
3.1
POWERS
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
3.2
NUMBER OF DIRECTORS
The number of directors constituting the whole board of directors shall be eleven, provided that the board of directors may change such number (but not below the number of directors then in office) by resolution from time to time within a range of seven to fifteen directors.
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
3.3
ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.
Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless a stockholder demands election by written ballot at the meeting and before voting begins.
3.4
RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES
Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events. When one or more directors so resigns, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies. When one or more directors resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date or upon the happening of a future event, a majority of the directors then in office (although less than a quorum), or a sole remaining director, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
A vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote or written consent of the stockholders or by a court order may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present. Each director so elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
(i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
(ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
A director elected or appointed to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor shall be elected and qualified.
3.5
PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE
The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
 
3.6 [RESERVED]
3.7
REGULAR MEETINGS
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice if the times of such meetings are fixed by the board of directors.
3.8
SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE
Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be given to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. Notice of such special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each director either (i) by mail not less than four (4) days before the date of the meeting, or (ii) personally, by telephone, telecopy, telegram, telex or other similar means of communication on twenty-four (24) hours' notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director whom the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director.
3.9
QUORUM
At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
3.10
WAIVER OF NOTICE

The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote, provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
The undersigned hereby certifies that she is the duly elected, qualified, and acting Secretary of Lam Research Corporation (the "Corporation") and that the foregoing Amended and Restated Bylaws were adopted as the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company effective as of May 17, 2013 by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
