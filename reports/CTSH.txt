ARTICLE IV A. The total number of shares of stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is One Hundred Forty Million (140,000,000) of which (i) One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares shall be shares of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Class A Common Stock"), and Twenty-five Million (25,000,000) shares shall be shares of Class B Common Stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Class B Common Stock") (the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock being collectively referred to herein as the "Common Stock"), and (ii) Fifteen Million (15,000,000) shares shall be shares of Preferred Stock, $.10 par value per share (the "Preferred Stock"). B. The number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Common Stock of the Corporation, voting together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the GCL or any corresponding provision hereinafter enacted. C. The following is a statement of the powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of the Corporation. (1) Except as otherwise set forth below in this Article IV, the powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be identical in all respects. (2) Subject to the rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, and subject to any other provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property of the Corporation as may be declared thereon by the Board of Directors of the Corporation from time to time out of assets or funds of the Corporation legally available therefor. If any dividend or other distribution in cash or other property is paid with respect to Class A Common Stock or with respect to Class B Common Stock (other than dividends or other distributions payable in shares of Common Stock), a like dividend or other distribution in cash or other property shall also be paid with respect to shares of the other class of Common Stock, in an amount equal per share. In the case of dividends or other distributions payable in Common Stock, including distributions pursuant to stock splits or divisions of Common Stock of the Corporation, only shares of Class A Common Stock shall be paid or distributed with respect to Class A Common Stock and only shares of Class B Common Stock shall be paid or distributed with respect to Class B Common Stock. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock so distributed shall be equal in number on a per share basis. Neither the shares of Class A Common Stock nor the shares of Class B Common Stock may be reclassified, subdivided or combined unless such reclassification, subdivision or combination occurs simultaneously and in the same proportion for each class. (3) (a) At every meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, every holder of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of Class A Common Stock standing in his, her or its name on the transfer books of the Corporation, and every holder of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to ten votes in person or by proxy for each share of Class B Common Stock standing in his, her or its name on the transfer books of the Corporation in connection with the election of directors and all other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders; provided, however, that with respect to any proposed conversion subsequent to a Tax-Free Spin-Off (as defined in paragraph (C)(6)(b) below) of the shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (C)(6)(b) below, each holder of a share of Common Stock, irrespective of class, shall have one vote in person or by proxy for each share of Common Stock standing in his, her or its name on the transfer books of the Corporation. Except as may be otherwise required by this Article IV, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Common Stock. (b) Subject to any rights of the holders of Preferred Stock, the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall not be modified, revised, altered or amended, repealed or rescinded in whole or in part, without the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class; provided, however, that with respect to any proposed amendment of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation which would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of Class A Common 2
Stock or Class B Common Stock so as to affect them adversely, the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the shares affected by the proposed amendment, voting separately as a class, shall be obtained in addition to the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock voting together as a single class as hereinbefore provided. Any increase in the authorized number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation or creation, authorization or issuance of any securities convertible into, or warrants, options or similar rights to purchase, acquire or receive, shares of any such class or classes of stock shall be deemed not to affect adversely the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. Neither the outcome of any vote with respect to any proposed conversion subsequent to a Tax-Free Spin-Off of the shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to paragraph (C)(6)(b) below nor the occurrence of the events described in the last sentence of paragraph (C)(6)(b)(iii) below shall be deemed to be a modification, revision, alteration, amendment, repeal or rescission of the provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. (c) Every reference in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation to a majority or other proportion of shares of Common Stock, Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes to which such shares of Common Stock, Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as applicable, are entitled. (4) In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after payment in full of the amounts required to be paid to the holders of Preferred Stock, the remaining assets and funds of the Corporation shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. For the purposes of this paragraph (C)(4), the voluntary sale, conveyance, lease, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or a consolidation or merger of the Corporation with one or more other corporations (whether or not the Corporation is the corporation surviving such consolidation or merger) shall not be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary. (5) In the event of any reorganization or any consolidation of the Corporation with one or more other corporations or a merger of the Corporation with another corporation unless immediately following such event, and based solely on the securities issued in connection therewith, a majority of the total voting power of the successor corporation is held by Persons (as defined in paragraph (C)(6)(b)(ii) below) that were stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such event, each holder of a share of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive with respect to such share the same kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reorganization, consolidation or merger by a holder of a share of Class B Common Stock and each holder of a share of Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive with respect to such share the same kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reorganization, consolidation or merger by a holder of a share of Class A Common Stock; provided, however, that in the event of any such reorganization or consolidation in which a majority 3
of the total voting power of the successor corporation is held by Persons that were stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such event, each holder of a share of Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive with respect to such share the same kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reorganization, consolidation or merger by a holder of a share of Class B Common Stock and vice versa except that any stock or securities received may differ insofar as is necessary to preserve the respective voting rights of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock hereunder. (6) (a) Prior to the date on which shares of Class B Common Stock are distributed to stockholders of Cognizant (as defined in paragraph (C)(6)(b) below) in a Tax-Free Spin-Off, each record holder of shares of Class B Common Stock may convert from time to time any or all of such shares into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock by surrendering the certificates for such shares, accompanied by any required tax transfer stamps and by a written notice by such record holder to the Corporation stating that such record holder desires to convert such shares of Class B Common Stock into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock and requesting that the Corporation issue all of such shares of Class A Common Stock to Persons named therein, setting forth the number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to each such Person and the denominations in which the certificates therefor are to be issued. To the extent permitted by law, such voluntary conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the date of such surrender. Following a Tax-Free Spin-Off, shares of Class B Common Stock shall no longer be convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock except as set forth in paragraph (C)(6)(b) below. (b) (i) Prior to a Tax-Free Spin-Off, each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one share of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to the transfer of such share if, after such transfer, such share is not Beneficially Owned (as defined below) by Cognizant. Shares of Class B Common Stock shall not convert into shares of Class A Common Stock (x) in any transfer effected in connection with a distribution of Class B Common Stock as a spin-off, split-up or split-off to stockholders of Cognizant intended to be on a tax-free basis under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code") (a "Tax-Free Spin-Off"), or (y) except as otherwise set forth below in this paragraph (C)(6)(b), in any transfer after a Tax-Free Spin-Off. For purposes of this paragraph (C)(6), a Tax-Free Spin-Off shall be deemed to have occurred at the time shares are first transferred to stockholders of Cognizant following receipt of an affidavit described in clauses (vi) or (vii) of the first sentence of paragraph (C)(6)(d) below. For purposes of this paragraph (C)(6), "Cognizant" shall mean Cognizant Corporation, a Delaware corporation, all successors to Cognizant Corporation by way of merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all its assets, and all corporations, partnerships, joint ventures, associations and other entities in which Cognizant Corporation Beneficially Owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding voting stock, voting power or similar voting interests ("Voting Interests") (each, a "Subsidiary Entity"), but which shall not include the Corporation or any Subsidiary Entity in which the Corporation Beneficially Owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding Voting Interests (it being understood that Cognizant shall mean IMS Health Incorporated upon consummation of the 4
reorganization of Cognizant into IMS Health Incorporated and Nielsen Media Research on or about June 30, 1998). The terms "Beneficially Own," "Beneficially Owns" and "Beneficially Owned" as used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as in effect on the date of filing of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. (ii) The term "Person" as used herein shall mean any individual, firm, corporation or other entity; each reference to an "individual" (or to a "record holder" of shares, if an individual) shall be deemed to include in his or her representative capacity a guardian, committee, executor, administrator or other legal representative of such individual or record holder. (iii) In the event of a Tax-Free Spin-Off, each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one share of Class A Common Stock (x) immediately prior to the first transfer of such share (such transfer being deemed to occur upon any change of the Beneficial Owner thereof) after such share is transferred to a stockholder of Cognizant in the Tax-Free Spin-Off or (y) if later, on the fifth anniversary of the date on which such share of Class B Common Stock is first transferred to a stockholder of Cognizant in the Tax-Free Spin-Off unless, prior to such Tax-Free Spin-Off, Cognizant delivers to the Corporation the written advice of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, to the effect that such conversion could adversely affect the ability of Cognizant to obtain a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the distribution would be a Tax-Free Spin-Off under the Code or the Internal Revenue Service has adopted a general non-ruling policy on tax-free spinoffs and that such conversion could adversely affect the status of the transaction as a Tax-Free Spin-Off. If such written advice of counsel is received, approval of such conversion shall be submitted to a vote of the holders of the Common Stock as soon as practicable after the fifth anniversary of the Tax-Free Spin-Off. At the meeting of stockholders called for such purpose, every holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote (irrespective of the voting rights provided for such shares under paragraph (C)(3)(a) above) in person or by proxy for each share of Common Stock standing in his or her name on the transfer books of the Corporation. Approval of such conversion shall require the approval of a majority of the votes, on the per share voting basis provided in the preceding sentence, entitled to be cast by the holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock present and voting, voting together as a single class, and the holders of the Class B Common Stock shall not be entitled to a separate class vote. Such conversion shall be effective on the date on which such approval is given at a meeting of stockholders called for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Cognizant delivers to the Corporation prior to such anniversary the written advice of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, to the effect that such vote could adversely affect the status of the transaction as a Tax-Free Spin-Off (including without limitation the ability to obtain a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service), such vote shall not be held and no such conversion shall take place. Upon delivery of such written advice of counsel as to such vote, and the further advice that the continued existence of this paragraph (C)(6)(b)(iii) itself could adversely affect the status of the transaction as a Tax-Free Spin-Off (including without limitation the ability to obtain a favorable ruling from the Internal 5
Revenue Service), then this paragraph (C)(6)(b)(iii) shall thereafter be null and void and no longer be deemed to be part of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation. (iv) If at any time the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall cease to represent at least 35% of the economic ownership represented by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, then each share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically convert into one share of Class A Common Stock. (v) The Corporation will provide notice of any automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock to holders of record as soon as practicable after the conversion; provided, however, that the Corporation may satisfy such notice requirement by providing such notice prior to conversion. Such notice shall be provided by mailing notice of such conversion first class postage prepaid, to each holder of record of the Common Stock, at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall affect the validity of the automatic conversion of any shares of Class B Common Stock. Each such notice shall state, as appropriate, the following: (A) the automatic conversion date; (B) that all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock are automatically converted; (C) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for conversion; and (D) that no dividends will be declared on the shares of Class B Common Stock converted after such conversion date. (vi) The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power and authority to determine in good faith, based on such information as it deems appropriate, (x) whether there has occurred a transfer of a share of Class B Common Stock as described in clause (x) of paragraph (C)(6)(b)(iii) above, and (y) whether at any time the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock represent less than 35% of the economic ownership represented by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding as described in paragraph (C)(6)(b)(iv) above. Immediately upon such conversion, the rights of the holders of shares of Class B Common Stock as such shall cease and such holders shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record owners of the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon such conversion; provided, however, that such Persons shall be entitled to receive when paid any dividends declared on the Class B Common Stock as of a record date preceding the time of such conversion and unpaid as of the time of such conversion, subject to paragraph (C)(6)(f) below. (c) Prior to a Tax-Free Spin-Off, holders of shares of Class B Common Stock may (i) sell or otherwise dispose of or transfer any or all of such shares held by them, respectively, only in connection with a transfer which meets the qualifications of paragraph (C)(6)(d) below, and under no other circumstances, or (ii) convert any or all of 6
such shares into shares of Class A Common Stock as provided in paragraph (C)(6)(a) above. Prior to a Tax-Free Spin-Off, no one other than those Persons in whose names shares of Class B Common Stock originally are registered on the stock ledger of the Corporation, or transferees or successive transferees who receive shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with a transfer which meets the qualifications set forth in paragraph (C)(6)(d) below, shall by virtue of the acquisition of a certificate for shares of Class B Common Stock have the status of an owner or holder of shares of Class B Common Stock or be recognized as such by the Corporation or be otherwise entitled to enjoy for his or her own benefit the special rights and powers of a holder of shares of Class B Common Stock. Holders of shares of Class B Common Stock may at any and all times transfer to any Person the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such shares of Class B Common Stock. (d) Prior to a Tax-Free Spin-Off, shares of Class B Common Stock shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation and a new certificate therefor issued, upon presentation at the office of the Secretary of the Corporation (or at such additional place or places as may from time to time be designated by the Secretary of the Corporation) of the certificate for such shares, in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all requisite stock transfer tax stamps, only if such certificate when so presented shall also be accompanied by any one of the following: (i) an affidavit from Cognizant stating that such certificate is being presented to effect a transfer by Cognizant of such shares to a successor of Cognizant or Subsidiary Entity of Cognizant; or (ii) an affidavit from Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant stating that such certificate is being presented to effect a transfer by any Subsidiary Entity of Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant of such shares to Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant or another Subsidiary Entity of Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant; or (iii) an affidavit from Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant stating that such certificate is being presented to effect a transfer by Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant of such shares to the stockholders of Cognizant or a successor of Cognizant in connection with a Tax-Free Spin-Off. Each affidavit of a record holder furnished pursuant to this paragraph (C)(6)(d) shall be verified as of a date not earlier than five days prior to the date of delivery thereof, and, where such record holder is a corporation or partnership, shall be verified by an officer of the corporation or by a general partner of the partnership, as the case may be. (e) Prior to the occurrence of a Tax-Free Spin-Off, each certificate for shares of Class B Common Stock shall bear a legend on the face thereof reading as follows: "The shares of Class B Common Stock represented by this Certificate may not be transferred to any person or entity in connection with a transfer that does not meet the qualifications set forth in paragraph (C)(6)(d) of Article IV of the Restated Certificate of 7
Incorporation of this Corporation and no person who receives such shares in connection with a transfer which does not meet the qualifications prescribed by paragraph (C)(6)(d) of said Article IV is entitled to own or to be registered as the record holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock and such shares will have been automatically converted into Class A Common Stock upon any such purported transfer. The record holder of this certificate may at any time convert such shares of Class B Common Stock into the same number of shares of Class A Common Stock. Each holder of this certificate, by accepting the same, accepts and agrees to all of the foregoing." Upon and after the transfer of shares in a Tax-Free Spin-Off, shares of Class B Common Stock shall no longer bear the legend set forth above in this paragraph (C)(6)(e), instead each certificate for shares of Class B Common Stock shall bear a legend on the face thereof reading as follows: "According to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, the shares of Class B Common Stock represented by this certificate will be automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock upon any transfer of such shares of Class B Common Stock. Consequently, no purported transferee of any shares of Class B Common Stock is entitled to own or to be registered as the record holder of such shares of Class B Common Stock but instead shall be entitled to own and be registered as the record holder of a like number of shares of Class A Common Stock. Each holder of this certificate, by accepting the same, accepts and agrees to all of the foregoing." (f) Upon any conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (C)(6), any dividend, for which the payment date shall be subsequent to such conversion, which may have been declared on the shares of Class B Common Stock so converted shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable, with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock into or for which such shares of Class B Common Stock shall have been so converted, and any such dividend payable in Common Stock shall be deemed to have been declared, and shall be payable, in shares of Class A Common Stock. (g) The Corporation shall not reissue or resell any shares of Class B Common Stock which shall have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to or as permitted by the provisions of this paragraph (C)(6), or any shares of Class B Common Stock which shall have been acquired by the Corporation in any other manner. The Corporation shall, from time to time, take such appropriate action as may be necessary to retire such shares and to reduce the authorized amount of Class B Common Stock accordingly. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as would become issuable upon the conversion of all shares of Class B Common Stock then outstanding. (h) In connection with any transfer or conversion of any stock of the Corporation pursuant to or as permitted by the provisions of this paragraph (C)(6) or in connection with the making of any determination referred to in this paragraph (C)(6): 8
(i) the Corporation shall be under no obligation to make any investigation of facts unless an officer, employee or agent of the Corporation responsible for making such transfer or determination or issuing Class A Common Stock pursuant to such conversion has substantial reason to believe, or unless the Board of Directors (or a committee of the Board of Directors designated for such purpose) determines that there is substantial reason to believe, that any affidavit or other document is incomplete or incorrect in a material respect or that an investigation would disclose facts upon which any determination referred to in paragraph (C)(6)(f) above should be made, in either of which events the Corporation shall make or cause to be made such investigation as it may deem necessary or desirable in the circumstances and have a reasonable time to complete such investigation; and (ii) neither the Corporation nor any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation shall be liable in any manner for any action taken or omitted in good faith. (i) The Corporation will not be required to pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of Class A Common Stock on the conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock pursuant to this paragraph (C)(6), and no such issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or has established, to the satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax has been paid. (7) All rights to vote and all voting power (including, without limitation thereto, the right to elect directors) shall be vested exclusively in the holders of Common Stock, voting together as a single class, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in a Preferred Stock Designation or as otherwise expressly required by applicable law. D. Subject to the limitations and in the manner provided by law, shares of the Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in series, and the Board of Directors of the Corporation or a duly-authorized committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, is hereby authorized to determine or alter the relative rights, powers (including voting powers), preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon Preferred Stock or any wholly unissued series of shares of Preferred Stock, and to increase or decrease (but not below the number of shares of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding) the number of shares of any such series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series. In case the number of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall upon the taking of any action required by applicable law resume the status which they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. ARTICLE V The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. In addition to the powers and authority expressly conferred upon them by 9
statute or by this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of the Corporation, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws so provide. ARTICLE VI The books and records of the Corporation may be kept (subject to any mandatory requirement of law) outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the bylaws of the Corporation. ARTICLE VII The Board of Directors shall be authorized to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the By-Laws of the corporation in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent in voting power of all outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal any provision of the By-Laws of the corporation. ARTICLE VIII (1) The board of directors shall consist of not less than three directors, the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. Commencing with the election of directors at the first annual meeting following this Restated Certificate of Incorporation becoming effective, the directors shall be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. Class I directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at the succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, Class II directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at the second succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, and Class III directors shall be originally elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders, other than the first annual meeting following this Restated Certificate of Incorporation becoming effective, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any additional director of any class elected to fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Any newly created directorship on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors 10
shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his predecessor. Directors may be removed only by the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent in voting power of all outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting as a single class. (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any series of preferred stock) applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Article VIII unless expressly provided by such terms. ARTICLE IX Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors, and special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. ARTICLE X A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation and its stockholders; (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law; (c) under Section 174 of the GCL; or (d) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the GCL hereafter is amended to further eliminate or limit the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation, in addition to the limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by the amended GCL. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article X shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 11
ARTICLE XI (1) The Corporation reserves the right to amend or repeal any provision contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon a stockholder herein are granted subject to this reservation. (2) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the corporation to the contrary, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent in voting power of all the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders to amend, alter, change, add to or repeal any provision of Article VII, Article VIII, Article IX or this Article XI or to adopt any provision inconsistent therewith. 12

SECTION 4. The holders of record of a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of the corporation, which are entitled to vote at the meeting, shall, except as otherwise provided by law, constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders. If there be no such quorum present in person or by proxy, the holders of a majority in voting power of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time. SECTION 5. (1) Meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, or, if neither is present, by a Vice President or, if no such officer is present, by a chairman to be chosen at the meeting.

If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman shall appoint a secretary. (2) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and
2 regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.

The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. SECTION 6. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting may vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question at the time; but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. SECTION 7. At all elections of directors the voting shall be by ballot, and a plurality of the votes cast shall elect. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation, or applicable law, all other questions to stockholders shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast on such questions. SECTION 8. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten (10) days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a
3 meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. SECTION 9. (A) Annual Meetings of Stockholders. (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 9 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 9, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (ii) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected;
4 (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws of the corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (iv) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation. (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation. B. Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 9 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is
5 entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. C. General. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(iv) of this Section 9) and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 9, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation. (2) For purposes of this Section 9, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9. Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the
6 Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation. ARTICLE II BOARD OF DIRECTORS SECTION 1. The Board of Directors of the corporation shall consist of such number of directors, not less than three, as shall from time to time be fixed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. A majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Directors need not be stockholders. SECTION 2. Vacancies in the Board of Directors and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall be filled as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation. SECTION 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of call of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, by oral, telegraphic, facsimile or written notice or notice by means of electronic transmission, duly served on or sent, given or mailed to each director not less than one day before the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after the meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting in person or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing or by electronic transmission. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings (or electronic transmission or transmissions) are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee. SECTION 4. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation, which to the extent permitted by law and provided in said resolution or resolutions, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of its business. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors, to act at the meeting for all purposes in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Such committee or committees shall have such
7 name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. ARTICLE III OFFICERS SECTION 1. The Board of Directors as soon as may be after their election held in each year shall elect officers of the corporation, including a Chief Executive Officer, one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The Board of Directors may also from time to time appoint such other officers (including a Chairman who shall be a member of the Board of Directors, one or more Vice Chairmen, one or more Assistant Secretaries and one or more Assistant Treasurers) as it may deem proper or may delegate to any elected officer of the corporation the power so to appoint and remove any such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive, Senior, or Regional, or may be given such other designation or combination of designations. SECTION 2. All officers of the corporation elected or appointed by the Board of Directors shall hold office until their respective successors are chosen and qualified. Any officer may be removed from office at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, or, in the case of appointed officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have been conferred by the Board of Directors. SECTION 3. Each of the officers of the corporation elected or appointed by the Board of Directors shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law, by the By-laws or by the Board of Directors and, unless otherwise prescribed by the By-laws or by the Board of Directors, shall have such further powers and duties as ordinarily pertain to his office. The Chief Executive Officer shall be the Principal Executive Officer and shall have the general direction of the affairs of the corporation. Any officer, agent, or employee of the corporation may be required to give bond for the faithful discharge of his duties in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. SECTION 4. The corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person (a "Covered Person") made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as specifically provided in this paragraph below, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The corporation shall to the fullest extend not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of
8 an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article III or otherwise. The corporation may indemnify, to the full extent permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article III is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. The indemnification provided by this Article III shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person indemnified may be entitled under by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be such director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article III or otherwise. ARTICLE IV CERTIFICATES OF STOCK SECTION 1. Except as otherwise determined by resolution of the Board of Directors in respect of any uncertificated shares, the interest of each stockholder of the corporation shall be evidenced by a certificate or certificates for shares of stock in such form as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. Subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer, the shares of the stock of the corporation shall be transferable on the books of the corporation by the holder thereof in person or by his attorney, upon surrender for cancellation of a certificate or certificates for the same number of shares, with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, and with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the corporation or its agents may reasonably require. SECTION 2. The certificates of stock shall be signed by such officer or officers as may be permitted by law to sign (except that where any such certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee, or by a registrar other than the corporation or its employee, the signatures of any such officer or officers may be facsimiles), and shall be countersigned and registered in such manner, all as the Board of Directors may by
9 resolution prescribe. In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been issued by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation. SECTION 3. No certificate for shares of stock in the corporation shall be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, except upon production of such evidence of such loss, theft or destruction and upon delivery to the corporation of a bond of indemnity in such amount, upon such terms and secured by such surety, as the Board of Directors in its discretion may require. ARTICLE V CORPORATE BOOKS The books of the corporation may be kept outside of the State of Delaware at such place or places as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine. ARTICLE VI CHECKS, NOTES, PROXIES, ETC. All checks and drafts on the corporation's bank accounts and all bills of exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and other instruments for the payment of money, shall be signed by such officer or officers or agent or agents as shall be thereunto authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors. Proxies to vote and consents with respect to securities of other corporations or entities owned by or standing in the name of the corporation may be executed and delivered from time to time on behalf of the corporation by the Chief Executive Officer, or by such officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.

"The year 2002 was successful for Cognizant on almost all fronts," said Kumar Mahadeva, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Foremost is our belief that we have firmly established Cognizant in the top tier of our peer group, widening the gap between ourselves and other competitors with the successful execution of our industry leading 4th Generation services model. In addition, we continue to benefit from the broad market acceptance of the offshore delivery model, which will fuel our growth in the years to come. This is best illustrated by the growing number of strategic client partnerships that we established over the course of the year, typically with larger companies that have embraced offshore outsourcing as a part of their own strategic initiatives. The growth opportunities with the many strategic clients we won during 2002 gives us a high degree of confidence in our outlook for 2003, as does the potential opportunities in our new deal pipeline which remains robust." "Cognizant's business model continued to generate strong results, with our year-end cash position rising to over $126 million, which includes the generation of $57 million of cash from operations during
2002," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer. "DSO, including unbilled receivables, improved further to 56 days, from 59 at the end of September and 64 at the end of June. Financial Services customers continue to account for a growing portion of our revenue mix, rising to 43% compared to 35% last quarter due to the ramp-up of several large customers. Total headcount increased to over 6,100, reflecting the strength of our business outlook for 2003. And finally, our existing clients remain highly satisfied as well, accounting for 85% of our business this quarter." CONFERENCE CALL Cognizant will host a conference call on February 12, at 5 PM.

RIGHTS AGREEMENT Rights Agreement, dated as of March 5, 2003 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT" ) between cognizant technology SOLUTIONS corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), and AMERICAN STOCK TRANSFER & TRUST COMPANY (the "RIGHTS AGENT"). On March 5, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the execution of this Agreement and the declaration of a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "RIGHT") for each share of Common Stock (as defined below) of the Company outstanding as of the close of business on March 17, 2003 (the "RECORD DATE"), with each Right representing the right to purchase one one-thousandth (subject to adjustment) of a share of Preferred Stock (as defined below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and the issuance of one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) with respect to each share of Common Stock that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date (as such terms are defined below); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Rights may be issued with respect to shares of Common Stock that shall become outstanding after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with Section 22. Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows: Section 1. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. For purposes of this Rights Agreement, the following terms have the meaning indicated: (a) "ACQUIRING PERSON" shall mean any Person (as defined below) who or which shall be the Beneficial Owner (as defined below) of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (as defined below), but shall not include an Exempt Person (as defined below); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith that a Person who would otherwise be an "Acquiring Person" has become such inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it beneficially owned a percentage of Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an "Acquiring Person" or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of its Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Rights Agreement) and without any intention of changing or influencing control of the Company, then such Person shall not be deemed to be or to have become an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes of this Rights Agreement unless and until such Person shall have failed to divest itself, as soon as practicable (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company), of Beneficial Ownership of a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock so that such Person would no longer otherwise qualify as an "Acquiring Person" for any purposes in this Agreement; (ii) if, as of the date hereof or prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of this Agreement, any Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, such Person shall not be deemed to be or to become an "Acquiring Person" unless and until such time as such Person shall (A) thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or
distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock) and (B) upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional shares of Common Stock referred to in clause (A), such Person is then the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; and (iii) no Person shall be deemed an "Acquiring Person" as the result of an acquisition of shares of Common Stock by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Person to 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding by reason of such share acquisitions by the Company referred to in this clause (iii) and thereafter becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock), then such Person shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person," unless upon the consummation of the acquisition of such additional shares of Common Stock such Person does not beneficially own 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. The phrase "then outstanding" , when used with reference to a Person's Beneficial Ownership of securities of the Company, shall mean the number of such securities then issued and outstanding together with the number of such securities not then actually issued and outstanding which such Person would be deemed to own beneficially hereunder. (b) "AFFILIATE" and "ASSOCIATE" shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), as in effect on the date of this Rights Agreement.

(d) "BUSINESS DAY" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or a day on which banking institutions in the State of New Jersey, the State of New York or the State in which the principal office of the Rights Agent is located, are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

(a) Until the close of business on the earlier of (i) the tenth day after the Stock Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth Business Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any Person (other than an Exempt Person) of, or of the first public announcement of the intention of such Person (other than an Exempt Person) to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in any Person (other than an Exempt Person) becoming the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as the "DISTRIBUTION DATE;" PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if either of such dates occurs after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the Record Date, then the Distribution Date shall be the Record Date), (x) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Section 3(b) hereof) by the certificates for Common Stock registered in the names of the holders thereof, or by a current ownership statement issued with respect to uncertificated shares of Common Stock in lieu of such a certificate (an "OWNERSHIP STATEMENT"), and not by separate Right Certificates (as defined below), and (y) the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Stock.

Until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate for Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date, with or without a copy of the Summary of Rights, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented thereby. (c) Rights shall be issued in respect of all shares of Common Stock issued or disposed of (including, without limitation, upon disposition of Common Stock out of treasury stock or issuance or reissuance of Common Stock out of authorized but unissued shares) after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date, or in certain -5-
circumstances provided in Section 22 hereof, after the Distribution Date. Certificates issued for Common Stock (including, without limitation, upon transfer of outstanding Common Stock, disposition of Common Stock out of treasury stock or issuance or reissuance of Common Stock out of authorized but unissued shares) after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend: This [certificate] [statement] also evidences and entitles the holder hereof to certain rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, dated as of March 5, 2003, as the same may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this [certificate] [statement]. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation will mail to the holder of this [certificate] [statement] a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request therefor. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, Rights owned by or transferred to any Person who is or becomes an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) and certain transferees thereof will become null and void and will no longer be transferable. With respect to such certificates or ownership statements containing the foregoing legend, until the Distribution Date, the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates or ownership statements shall be evidenced by such certificates or ownership statements alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate or the transfer of any shares of Common Stock represented by such ownership statements, except as otherwise provided herein, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented thereby. In the event that the Company purchases or otherwise acquires any Common Stock after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any Rights associated with such Common Stock shall be deemed cancelled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock which are no longer outstanding. Notwithstanding this paragraph (c), the omission of a legend shall not affect the enforceability of any part of this Rights Agreement or the rights of any holder of the Rights. Section 4. FORM OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES. The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase shares and of assignment to be printed on the reverse thereof) shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Rights Agreement, -6-
or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or of any other stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed, or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of Sections 11 and 22 hereof, the Right Certificates shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock as shall be set forth therein at the Purchase Price (as determined pursuant to Section 7), but the amount and type of securities purchasable upon the exercise of each Right and the Purchase Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein. Section 5. COUNTERSIGNATURE AND REGISTRATION. (a) The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the Chief Executive Officer, any of the Vice Presidents or the Treasurer of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company's seal or a facsimile thereof and shall be attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be countersigned by the Rights Agent, either manually or by facsimile signature, and shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of the Right Certificates, or shall have attested the Company's seal thereon, shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the Company with the same force and effect as though the Person who signed such Right Certificates, or who attested the Company's seal thereon, had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company, and the Company's seal may be attested, by any Person who, at the actual date of the execution of such Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this Rights Agreement any such Person was not such an officer. (b) Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at an office or agency designated for such purpose, books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right Certificates. Section 6. TRANSFER, SPLIT UP, COMBINATION AND EXCHANGE OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES; MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN RIGHT CERTIFICATES. (a) Subject to the provisions of this Rights Agreement, at any time after the close of business on the Distribution Date, and prior to the close of business on the Expiration Date, any Right Certificate or Right Certificates may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (or, following such time, other securities, cash or assets as the case may be) as the Right Certificate or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the office or agency of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose. Thereupon the Rights Agent, subject to the provisions of this Rights Agreement, shall countersign and -7-
deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates. (b) Subject to the provisions of this Rights Agreement, at any time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, upon receipt by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated. Section 7. EXERCISE OF RIGHTS, PURCHASE PRICE; EXPIRATION DATE OF RIGHTS. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Rights shall become exercisable on the Distribution Date, and thereafter the registered holder of any Right Certificate may, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and except as otherwise provided herein, exercise the Rights evidenced thereby in whole or in part upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the office or agency of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, together with payment of the Purchase Price for each one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (or other securities, cash or assets, as the case may be) as to which the Rights are exercised, at any time which is both after the Distribution Date and prior to the time (the "EXPIRATION DATE") that is the earliest of (i) the close of business on March 5, 2013 (the "FINAL EXPIRATION DATE"), (ii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the "REDEMPTION DATE") or (iii) the time at which such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section 24 hereof. (b) The purchase price (the "PURCHASE PRICE") shall be initially $450.00 for each one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. The Purchase Price and the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock or other securities or property to be acquired upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof and shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 7. (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be purchased and an amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 6 hereof, in cash or by certified check, cashier's check or money order payable to the order of the Company, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly (i) (A) requisition from any transfer agent of the Preferred Stock (or make available if the Rights Agent is the transfer agent of the Preferred Stock) certificates for the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be purchased (and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to comply with all such requests), or (B) requisition from the depositary agent appointed by the Company depositary receipts representing interests in such -8-
number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock as are to be purchased, in which case certificates for the Preferred Stock represented by such receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with the depositary agent (and the Company hereby directs the depositary agent to comply with such request), (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) promptly after receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts, cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, promptly deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate. (d) Except as otherwise provided herein, in case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the exercisable Rights remaining unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof. (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with respect to a registered holder of Rights upon the occurrence of any purported transfer or exercise of Rights pursuant to Section 6 hereof or this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the form of assignment or election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such transfer or exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) thereof as the Company or the Rights Agent shall reasonably request. Section 8. CANCELLATION AND DESTRUCTION OF RIGHT CERTIFICATES. All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all cancelled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written request of the Company, destroy or cause to be destroyed such cancelled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof to the Company. Section 9. AVAILABILITY OF SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK. (a) The Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock or any shares of Preferred Stock held in its treasury, the number of shares of Preferred Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of all outstanding Rights. (b) So long as the shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the time that a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) issuable upon the exercise of Rights may be listed or admitted to trading on Nasdaq or listed on any other national securities exchange or quotation system, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to -9-
cause, from and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, all shares reserved for such issuance to be listed or admitted to trading on Nasdaq or listed on any other exchange or quotation system upon official notice of issuance upon such exercise. (c) From and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, if then necessary to permit the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) upon the exercise of Rights, to register and qualify such shares of Preferred Stock (and following the time that a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities or "Blue Sky" laws (to the extent exemptions therefrom are not available), cause such registration statement and qualifications to become effective as soon as possible after such filing and keep such registration and qualifications effective until the earlier of (x) the date as of which the Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and (y) the Expiration Date. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days, the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. Notwithstanding any provision of this Rights Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite qualification or exemption in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a registration statement under the Securities Act (if required) shall have been declared effective. (d) The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Preferred Stock (and, following the time that a Person becomes an Acquiring Person, shares of Common Stock and other securities) delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates therefor (subject to payment of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares. (e) The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any shares of Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities) upon the exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer or delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depositary receipts for the Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities) in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue or deliver any certificates or depositary receipts for Preferred Stock (or shares of Common Stock or other securities) upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax or charge shall have been paid (any such tax or charge being payable by that holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to the Company's reasonable satisfaction that no such tax or charge is due. Section 10. PREFERRED STOCK RECORD DATE. Each Person in whose name any certificate for Preferred Stock is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be -10-
deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any applicable transfer taxes or charges) was made; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which such transfer books are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights of a holder of Preferred Stock for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends or other distributions, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided herein. Section 11. ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE, NUMBER AND KIND OF SHARES AND NUMBER OF RIGHTS. The Purchase Price, the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property purchasable upon exercise of each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this Section 11. (a) (i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a dividend on the Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, (C) combine the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock into a smaller number of shares of Preferred Stock or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the shares of Preferred Stock (including any such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the Purchase Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, as the case may be, and the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred Stock transfer books of the Company were open, the holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, combination or reclassification; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. (ii) Subject to Section 24 of this Rights Agreement and except as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 11(a)(iii), in the event that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at a price equal to the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such Person becoming an Acquiring Person, in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement and in lieu of shares of Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock (or at the option of the Company, such number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock) as shall equal the result obtained by (x) multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such Person becoming an Acquiring Person by the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right is then exercisable and dividing that product by (y) 50% of the current per share market price of the Company's Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on -11-
the date of the occurrence of such event; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) and the number of shares of Common Stock so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall thereafter be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(f) hereof. Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, however, from and after the time (the "INVALIDATION TIME") when any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, any Rights that are beneficially owned by (x) any Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (y) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the invalidation time or (z) a transferee of any Acquiring Person (or any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with the invalidation time pursuant to either (I) a transfer from the Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding, written or otherwise, regarding the transferred Rights or (II) a transfer that the Board of Directors has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding, written or otherwise, which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this paragraph, and subsequent transferees of such Persons, shall be null and void without any further action and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this Rights Agreement. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates, Associates or transferees hereunder. From and after the invalidation time, no Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 6 hereof that represents Rights that are or have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be cancelled. From and after the occurrence of an event specified in Section 13(a) hereof, any Rights that theretofore have not been exercised pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii) shall thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section 13 and not pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii). (iii) The Company may at its option substitute for a share of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock having an aggregate current market value equal to the current per share market price of a share of Common Stock. In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued (and unreserved) to permit the exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Board of Directors shall, with respect to such deficiency, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party (A) determine the excess of (x) the value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Right in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) (the "CURRENT VALUE") over (y) the then-current Purchase Price multiplied by the number of one one-thousandths of shares of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the time that the Acquiring Person became such (such excess, the "SPREAD"), and (B) with respect to each Right (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)), make adequate provision to substitute for the shares of Common Stock issuable in -12-
accordance with subparagraph (ii) upon exercise of the Right and payment of the applicable Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) shares of Preferred Stock or other equity securities of the Company (including, without limitation, shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock which, by virtue of having dividend, voting and liquidation rights substantially comparable to those of the shares of Common Stock, are deemed in good faith by the Board of Directors to have substantially the same value as the shares of Common Stock (such shares of preferred stock and shares or fractions of shares of preferred stock are hereinafter referred to as "COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS")), (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets or (6) any combination of the foregoing, having a value which, when added to the value of the shares of Common Stock actually issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an aggregate value equal to the Current Value (less the amount of any reduction in such Purchase Price), where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors upon the advice of a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected in good faith by the Board of Directors; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, if the Company shall not make adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days following the date that the Acquiring Person became such (the "SECTION 11(a)(ii) TRIGGER DATE"), then the Company shall be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a party, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of the Purchase Price, shares of Common Stock (to the extent available), and then, if necessary, such number or fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (to the extent available) and then, if necessary, cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value equal to the Spread. If, within the thirty (30) day period referred to above, the Board of Directors shall determine in good faith that it is likely that sufficient additional shares of Common Stock could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, then, if the Board of Directors so elects, such thirty (30) day period may be extended to the extent necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek stockholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such thirty (30) day period, as it may be extended, is hereinafter called the "SUBSTITUTION PERIOD"). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to the second and/or third sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and the last sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights and (y) may suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such second sentence and to determine the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the shares of Common Stock shall be the current per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i)) on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date and the per share or fractional value of any Common Stock equivalent shall be deemed to equal the current per share market price of the Common Stock. The Board of Directors of the Company may, but shall not be required to, establish procedures to allocate the right to receive shares of -13-
Common Stock upon the exercise of the Rights among holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii). (b) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Preferred Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock (or shares having the same rights, privileges and preferences as the Preferred Stock ("EQUIVALENT PREFERRED SHARES")) or securities convertible into Preferred Stock or equivalent preferred shares at a price per share of Preferred Stock or equivalent preferred shares (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into shares of Preferred Stock or equivalent preferred shares) less than the then-current per share market price of the Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock and equivalent preferred shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares of Preferred Stock and equivalent preferred shares which the aggregate offering price of the total number of such shares so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at such current market price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock and equivalent preferred shares outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Preferred Stock and/or equivalent preferred shares to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities so to be offered are initially convertible); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in a consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and which shall be conclusive for all purposes. Shares of Preferred Stock and equivalent preferred shares owned by or held for the account of the Company shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. (c) In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Preferred Stock) or subscription rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then-current per share market price of the Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date, less the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes) of the portion of such assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Preferred Stock, -14-
and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price of the Preferred Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof); provided, however, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company to be issued upon exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. (d) (i) Except as otherwise provided herein, for the purpose of any computation hereunder, the "current per share market price" of any security (a "SECURITY" for the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices per share of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as defined below) immediately prior to but not including such date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that the current per share market price of the Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination or reclassification of such Security, and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported by (w) the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or (x) if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading or, if (y) the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use, or, (z) if on any such date the Security is not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The term "TRADING DAY" shall mean a day on which the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day. (ii) For the purpose of any computation hereunder, if the Preferred Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Stock shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the Preferred Stock is not publicly traded but the Common Stock is publicly traded, the "current per share market price" of the Preferred Stock shall be conclusively deemed to be the current per share market price of the Common Stock, as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i), multiplied by one thousand (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof). If neither the Common Stock nor the Preferred Stock is publicly traded, "current per share market price" shall mean the fair value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the -15-
Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and shall be conclusive for all purposes. (e) No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase Price; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any adjustments not required to be made by reason of this Section 11(e) shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock or share of Common Stock or other share or security as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment or (ii) the Expiration Date. (f) If as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than the Preferred Stock, thereafter the Purchase Price and the number of such other shares so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Preferred Stock contained in Sections 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), 11(e), 11(h), 11(i) and 11(m) and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 hereof with respect to the Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares. (g) All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein. (h) Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment of the Purchase Price. (i) The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 11(b) or 11(c) hereof to adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest one ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price -16-
in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. This record date may be the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company may, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled as a result of such adjustment. Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement. (j) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder. (k) Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Preferred Stock or other shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights, the Company shall take any corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Preferred Stock or other such shares at such adjusted Purchase Price. (l) In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event the issuing to the holder of any Right exercised after such record date the Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the Preferred Stock, Common Stock or other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment. (m) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11 to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to make such adjustments in the Purchase Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Preferred Stock, -17-
issuance (wholly for cash) of any shares of Preferred Stock at less than the current market price, issuance (wholly for cash) of Preferred Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible into or exchangeable for Preferred Stock, dividends on Preferred Stock payable in shares of Preferred Stock or issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Preferred Stock shall not be taxable to such stockholders. (n) Notwithstanding anything in this Rights Agreement to the contrary, in the event that at any time after the date of this Rights Agreement and prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall (i) declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock or (ii) effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend payable in Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in any such case, the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock following any such event shall equal the result obtained by multiplying the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event. The adjustments provided for in this Section 11(n) shall be made successively (but without duplication) whenever such a dividend is declared or paid or such subdivision, combination or consolidation is effected. (o) The Company agrees that, after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition Date, it will not, except as permitted by Sections 23, 24 or 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights. Section 12. CERTIFICATE OF ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE OR NUMBER OF SHARES. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11 or 13 hereof, the Company shall promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof (if so required under Section 25 hereof). The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment therein contained. Section 13. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE OR TRANSFER OF ASSETS OR EARNINGS POWER. (a) In the event, directly or indirectly, at any time after any Person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the Company shall merge with and into any other Person, (ii) any Person shall consolidate with the Company, or any Person shall merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part of the Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other Person (or of the Company) or cash or any other property, or (iii) the Company shall sell or -18-
otherwise transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating to 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person (other than the Company or one or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries), then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that: (A) each holder of record of a Right (other than Rights which have become null and void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at a price equal to the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)) multiplied by the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable (whether or not such Right was then exercisable) immediately prior to the time that any Person first became an Acquiring Person (each as subsequently adjusted thereafter pursuant to Section 11(a)(i), 11(b), 11(c), 11(h), 11(i) and 11(m)), in accordance with the terms of this Rights Agreement and in lieu of Preferred Stock, such number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and freely tradeable shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party (as defined below) not subject to any liens, encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall be equal to the result obtained by (1) multiplying the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)) by the number of one one-thousandths of a share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to the time that any Person first became an Acquiring Person (as subsequently adjusted thereafter pursuant to Sections 11(a)(i), 11(b), 11(c), 11(h), 11(i) and 11(m)) and (2) dividing that product by 50% of the current per share market price of the Common Stock of such Principal Party (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; provided that the Purchase Price and the number of shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party issuable upon exercise of each Right shall be further adjusted as provided in Section 11(f) of this Rights Agreement to reflect any events occurring in respect of such Principal Party after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; (B) such Principal Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Rights Agreement; (C) the term "Company" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party; and (D) such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its shares of its Common Stock) in connection with such consummation of any such transaction as may be necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the shares of its Common Stock thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; PROVIDED that, upon the subsequent occurrence of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets or other extraordinary transaction in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be entitled to receive, upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price as provided in this Section 13(a), such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder, at the time of such transaction, owned the Common Stock of the Principal Party receivable upon the exercise of a Right pursuant to this Section 13(a), and such Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of shares of stock) as may be necessary to permit the subsequent exercise of the -19-
Rights in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property. (b) "PRINCIPAL PARTY" shall mean: (i) in the case of any transaction described in clauses (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of Section 13(a) hereof: (A) the Person that is the issuer of the securities into which the shares of Common Stock are converted in such merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than one such issuer, the issuer of the shares of Common Stock of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding, or (B) if no securities are so issued, (x) the Person that is the other party to the merger, if such Person survives said merger, or, if there is more than one such Person, the Person the shares of Common Stock of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding or (y) if the Person that is the other party to the merger does not survive the merger, the Person that does survive the merger (including the Company if it survives) or (z) the Person resulting from the consolidation; and (ii) in the case of any transaction described in clause (iii) of the first sentence in Section 13(a) hereof, the Person that is the party receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions, or, if each Person that is a party to such transaction or transactions receives the same portion of the assets or earning power so transferred or if the Person receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power cannot be determined, whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Stock having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in any such case described in the foregoing clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii), if the Common Stock of such Person is not at such time or has not been continuously over the preceding 12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, then (1) if such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of another Person the Common Stock of which is and has been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to such other Person, or (2) if such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, and the Common Stocks of all of such persons have been so registered, the term "Principal Party" shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Stock having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding, or (3) if such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the same Person, the rules set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above shall apply to each of the owners having an interest in the venture as if the Person owned by the joint venture was a Subsidiary of both or all of such joint venturers, and the Principal Party in each such case shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section 13 in the same ratio as its interest in such Person bears to the total of such interests. (c) The Company shall not consummate any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer referred to in Section 13(a) hereof unless prior thereto the Company and the Principal Party involved therein shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent an agreement confirming that the requirements of Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof shall promptly be performed in accordance with their terms and that such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer of assets shall not result in a default by the Principal Party under this Rights Agreement as the same shall have -20-
been assumed by the Principal Party pursuant to Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof and providing that, as soon as practicable after executing such agreement pursuant to this Section 13, the Principal Party will: (i) prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act, if necessary, with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on an appropriate form, use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the Expiration Date, and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws; (ii) use its best efforts, if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or on another national securities exchange, to list or admit to trading (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or such securities exchange, or, if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall not be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or a national securities exchange, to cause the Rights and the securities receivable upon exercise of the Rights to be reported by such other system then in use; (iii) deliver to holders of the Rights historical financial statements for the Principal Party which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the Exchange Act; and (iv) obtain waivers of any rights of first refusal or preemptive rights in respect of the Common Stock of the Principal Party subject to purchase upon exercise of outstanding Rights. (d) In case the Principal Party has a provision in any of its authorized securities or in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other instrument governing its affairs, which provision would have the effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue (other than to holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 13), in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of a transaction referred to in this Section 13, shares of Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents of such Principal Party at less than the then-current market price per share thereof (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) or securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents of such Principal Party at less than such then-current market price, or (ii) providing for any special payment, tax or similar provision in connection with the issuance of the Common Stock of such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 13, then, in such event, the Company hereby agrees with each holder of Rights that it shall not consummate any such transaction unless prior thereto the Company and such Principal Party shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing that the provision in question of such Principal Party shall have been canceled, waived or amended, or that the authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable provision will have no effect in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of the proposed transaction. -21-
(e) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after a Person first becomes an Acquiring Person enter into any transaction of the type contemplated by Sections 13(a)(i), 13(a)(ii) and 13(a)(iii) hereof if (x) at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or other transaction there are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (y) prior to, simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or other transaction, the stockholders of the Person who constitutes, or would constitute, the Principal Party for purposes of Section 13(b) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates or (z) the form or nature of organization of the Principal Party would preclude or limit the exercisability of the Rights. Section 14. FRACTIONAL RIGHTS AND FRACTIONAL SHARES. (a) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported by (w) the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or, (x) if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or admitted to trading or, (y) if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by Nasdaq or such other system then in use or, (z) if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used. (b) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock) upon exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock). Interests in fractions of Preferred Stock in integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts, pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depositary selected by it; PROVIDED, that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depositary receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as beneficial owners of the Preferred Stock represented by such depositary receipts. In lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock that are not integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of -22-
Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised for shares of Preferred Stock as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of one share of Preferred Stock. For the purposes of this Section 14(b), the current market value of a share of Preferred Stock shall be the closing price of a share of Preferred Stock (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise. (c) The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional shares of Common Stock upon the exercise or exchange of Rights. In lieu of such fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company shall pay to the registered holders of the Right Certificates at the time such Rights are exercised or exchanged for shares of Common Stock as herein provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such exercise or exchange. (d) The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives the right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional shares upon exercise or exchange of a Right (except as provided above). Section 15. RIGHTS OF ACTION. All rights of action in respect of this Rights Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of the Common Stock); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), on such holder's own behalf and for such holder's own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such holder's right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, such Common Stock) in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in this Rights Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Rights Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of the obligations of any Person subject to, this Rights Agreement. Section 16. AGREEMENT OF RIGHT HOLDERS. Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with every other holder of a Right that: (i) prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Stock; (ii) after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the office or agency of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer; and -23-
(iii) the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the Common Stock) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the Common Stock certificate made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent, subject to Section 7(e) hereof, shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Section 17. RIGHT CERTIFICATE HOLDER NOT DEEMED A STOCKHOLDER. No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of the Preferred Stock or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise or exchange of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in this Rights Agreement), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised or exchanged in accordance with the provisions hereof. Section 18. CONCERNING THE RIGHTS AGENT. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration and execution of this Rights Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for any action or omission by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration of this Rights Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly. (b) The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no liability for, or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with, its administration of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate or certificate for the Preferred Stock or Common Stock or for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth in Section 20 hereof. Section 19. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OR CHANGE OF NAME OF RIGHTS AGENT. (a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the stock transfer or corporate trust powers of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided, that such Person -24-
would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Rights Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of such successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement. (b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Rights Agreement. Section 20. DUTIES OF RIGHTS AGENT. The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations imposed by this Rights Agreement upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound: (a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such opinion. (b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Rights Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by any one of the Chief Executive Officer, any Vice President, the Treasurer or the Secretary of the Company (each, an "AUTHORIZED OFFICER") and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Rights Agreement in reliance upon such certificate. (c) The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder to the Company and any other Person only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or wilful misconduct. (d) The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Rights Agreement or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only. -25-
(e) The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Rights Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Rights Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming null and void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights (including the manner, method or amount thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13, 23 and 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12, describing such change or adjustment); nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares of Preferred Stock or other securities to be issued pursuant to this Rights Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any shares of Preferred Stock or other securities will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable. (f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Rights Agreement. (g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any person reasonably believed by the Rights Agent to be one of the Authorized Officers, and to apply to such Authorized Officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such Authorized Officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall not be less than five Business Days after the date any Authorized Officer of the Company actually receives such application, unless any such Authorized Officer shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission), the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted. (h) The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Rights Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity. -26-
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof. (j) If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in the form of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has not been completed to certify the holder is not an Acquiring Person (or an Affiliate or Associate thereof) or a transferee thereof, the Rights Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company. Section 21. CHANGE OF RIGHTS AGENT. The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Rights Agreement upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail, and, following the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail, and, following the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (A) a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50 million or (B) an affiliate of a Person described in clause (A) of this sentence. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock, and, following the Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be. -27-
Section 22. ISSUANCE OF NEW RIGHT CERTIFICATES. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Rights Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such forms as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Rights Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Common Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company may with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to (i) the exercise of stock options, (ii) under any employee plan or arrangement, (iii) the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities, notes or debentures issued by the Company or (iv) a contractual obligation of the Company, in each case existing prior to the Distribution Date, issue Right Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale. Section 23. REDEMPTION. (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to such time as any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all but not less than all the then-outstanding Rights at a redemption price of $.01 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date hereof (the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. The Company may, at its option, pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of Common Stock (based on the current market price of the Common Stock at the time of redemption as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) hereof) or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. (b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 23 (or at such later time as the Board of Directors may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption. Within 10 days after such action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemption of the Rights (or such later time as the Board of Directors may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), the Company shall mail a notice of redemption to all the holders of the then-outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption shall state the method by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made. Section 24. EXCHANGE. (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after any Person first becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then-outstanding and exercisable Rights (which shall not include Rights that have not become effective or that have become null and void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar -28-
transaction occurring after the date hereof (such amount per Right being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE RATIO"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of shares of Common Stock aggregating 50% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. From and after the occurrence of an event specified in Section 13(a) hereof, any Rights that theretofore have not been exchanged pursuant to this Section 24(a) shall thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section 13 and may not be exchanged pursuant to this Section 24(a). The exchange of the Rights by the Board of Directors may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. (b) Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such exchange; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company shall promptly mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of the Rights so exchanged at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number of Rights which will be exchanged.

(c) The Company may at its option substitute and, in the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued (and unreserved) to permit an exchange of Rights as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company shall substitute to the extent of such insufficiency, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, a number of shares of Preferred Stock or fraction thereof (or equivalent preferred shares as such term is defined in Section 11(b)) such that the current per share market price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of one share of Preferred Stock (or equivalent preferred share) multiplied by such number or fraction is equal to the current per share market price of one share of Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) as of the date of such exchange. Section 25. NOTICE OF CERTAIN EVENTS. (a) In case the Company shall at any time after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition Date propose (i) to pay any dividend payable in stock of any class to the holders of its Preferred Stock or to make any other distribution to the holders of its Preferred Stock (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend), (ii) to offer to the holders of its Preferred Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or to purchase any additional shares of Preferred Stock or shares of stock of any class or any other securities, rights or options, (iii) to effect any reclassification of its Preferred Stock (other than a reclassification involving only the subdivision or combination of outstanding Preferred Stock), -29-

EXHIBIT A --------- FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK OF COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORPORATION (Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) ------------------- Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "COMPANY"), hereby certifies that the following resolution was duly adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on March 5, 2003 in accordance with the provisions of Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware: RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors of the Company (hereinafter being referred to as the "BOARD OF DIRECTORS" or the "BOARD") in accordance with the provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (hereinafter being referred to as the "CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"), the Board of Directors hereby creates a series of Preferred Stock, par value $.10 per share, of the Company, to be designated the "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" and hereby adopts the resolution establishing the designations, number of shares, preferences, voting powers and other rights and the restrictions and limitations thereof, of the shares of such series as set forth below: Section 1. DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT. The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock" (the "SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK") and the number of shares constituting the Series A Preferred Stock shall be 125,000. Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors; PROVIDED, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Company convertible into Series A Preferred Stock. Section 2. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (A) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock of the Company (the "PREFERRED STOCK") (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Class A Common A-1
Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "COMMON STOCK") and of any other stock of the Company ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE"), commencing on the first Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock (the "ISSUE DATE"), in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock, declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time after March 17, 2003 declare and pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) The Company shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); PROVIDED that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable, when, as and if declared, on such subsequent Dividend Payment Date. (C) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative, whether or not earned or declared, on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by- A-2
share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. Section 3. VOTING RIGHTS. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (A) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth and except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or required by law, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters upon which the holders of the Common Stock of the Company are entitled to vote. In the event the Company shall at any time after March 17, 2003 declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. (B) Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation or in any other Certificate of Designations creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock, and except as otherwise required by law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Company having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Company. (C) Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. (D) If, at the time of any annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, the equivalent of six quarterly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on any share or shares of Series A Preferred Stock are in default, the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors of the Company shall be increased by two. In addition to voting together with the holders of Common Stock for the election of other directors of the Company, the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class to the exclusion of the holders of Common Stock, shall be entitled at said meeting of stockholders (and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders), unless all dividends in arrears on the Series A Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and set apart for payment prior thereto, to vote for the election of two directors of the Company, the holders of any Series A Preferred Stock being entitled to cast a number of votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock as is specified in paragraph (A) of this Section 3. Each A-3
such additional director shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors, or until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, or until his right to hold such office terminates pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3(D). Until the default in payments of all dividends which permitted the election of said directors shall cease to exist, any director who shall have been so elected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 3(D) may be removed at any time, without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast for the election of any such director at a special meeting of such holders called for that purpose, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the vote of such holders. If and when such default shall cease to exist, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing special voting rights, subject to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent like default in payments of dividends. Upon the termination of the foregoing special voting rights, the terms of office of all persons who may have been elected directors pursuant to said special voting rights shall forthwith terminate, and the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two. The voting rights granted by this Section 3(D) shall be in addition to any other voting rights granted to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in this Section 3. Section 4. CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. (A) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not earned or declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Company shall not: (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Company ranking junior (as to dividends and upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock or rights, warrants or options to acquire such junior stock; or A-4
(iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. (B) The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Company unless the Company could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. Section 5. REACQUIRED SHARES. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their retirement become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject to any conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein. Section 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, no distribution shall be made (A) to the holders of the Common Stock or of shares of any other stock of the Company ranking junior, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $100 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (B) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up with the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A liquidation preference and the liquidation preferences of all other classes and series of stock of the Company, if any, that rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock in respect thereof, then the assets available for such distribution shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of such parity shares in the proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the event the Company shall at any time after the Issue Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (A) of A-5
the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Neither the merger or consolidation of the Company into or with another entity nor the merger or consolidation of any other entity into or with the Company (nor the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company) shall be deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company within the meaning of this Section 6. Section 7. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC. In case the Company shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are converted into, exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly converted into, exchanged for or changed into an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is converted, exchanged or converted. In the event the Company shall at any time after the Issue Date declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the conversion, exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. Section 8. NO REDEMPTION. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable from any holder. Section 9. RANK. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, junior to all other series of Preferred Stock and senior to the Common Stock. Section 10. AMENDMENT. If any proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (including this Certificate of Designations) would alter, change or repeal any of the preferences, powers or special rights given to the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect the Series A Preferred Stock adversely, then the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote separately as a class upon such amendment, and the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall be necessary for the adoption thereof, in addition to such other vote as may be required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Section 11. FRACTIONAL SHARES. Series A Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share that shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, A-6
to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock. A-7

EXHIBIT C --------- UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS SET FORTH IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT, RIGHTS OWNED BY OR TRANSFERRED TO ANY PERSON WHO IS OR BECOMES AN ACQUIRING PERSON (AS DEFINED IN THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT) AND CERTAIN TRANSFEREES THEREOF WILL BECOME NULL AND VOID AND WILL NO LONGER BE TRANSFERABLE. SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE Shares of Preferred Stock On March 5, 2003, the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "COMPANY") declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "RIGHT") for each outstanding share of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "COMMON STOCK"). The dividend is payable on March 17, 2003 (the "RECORD DATE") to the stockholders of record on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.10 per share (the "PREFERRED STOCK") of the Company at a price of $450 per one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock (as the same may be adjusted, the "PURCHASE PRICE"). The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of March 5, 2003 (as the same may be amended from time to time, the "RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "RIGHTS AGENT"). Until the close of business on the earlier of (i) the tenth day after the first date of a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an "ACQUIRING PERSON") has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) the tenth business day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an Acquiring Person) after the date of commencement of, or the first public announcement of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the earlier of such dates being called the "DISTRIBUTION DATE"), the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates or by a current ownership statement issued with respect to uncertificated shares of Common Stock in lieu of such a certificate (an "OWNERSHIP STATEMENT"). The Rights Agreement does not restrict any person who beneficially owns 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding as of the date of the Rights Agreement or the date of the first public announcement of the Rights Agreement, so long as such person does not become the beneficial owner of additional shares of Common Stock and, upon becoming the beneficial owner of such additional shares, such person is still (or again becomes) the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding. The phrase "THEN OUTSTANDING," when used with reference to a Person's beneficial ownership of the Company's Common Stock, shall mean the number of such securities then issued and outstanding together with the number of such securities not then actually issued and outstanding which such Person would be deemed to own beneficially under the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights), the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Stock. Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption or expiration C-1
of the Rights), the surrender for transfer of any certificates for shares of Common Stock, or the transfer of any shares of Common Stock represented by an Ownership Statement, outstanding as of the Record Date, even without a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference or a copy of this Summary of Rights, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the shares of Common Stock represented by such certificate or Ownership Statement. As soon as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("RIGHT CERTIFICATES") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution Date and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights. The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on March 5, 2013 (the "FINAL EXPIRATION DATE"), unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company, in each case as described below. The Purchase Price payable, and the number of shares of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable, upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Stock of certain rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Stock at a price, or securities convertible into Preferred Stock with a conversion price, less than the then-current market price of the Preferred Stock or (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in Preferred Stock) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those referred to above). The Rights are also subject to adjustment in the event of a stock dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Stock occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date. Shares of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled, when, as and if declared, to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of the greater of (a) $1 per share and (b) an amount equal to 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends) but will be entitled to an aggregate 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock. Each share of Preferred Stock will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Stock. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged, each share of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions. Because of the nature of the Preferred Stock's dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-thousandth interest in a share of Preferred Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one share of Common Stock. C-2
In the event that any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void), will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price, that number of shares of Common Stock having a market value of two times the Purchase Price. In the event that, after a person or group has become an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right (other than Rights beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person which will have become void) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then-current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the person with whom the Company has engaged in the foregoing transaction (or its parent), which number of shares at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the Purchase Price. At any time after any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the occurrence of an event described in the prior paragraph, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange the Rights (other than Rights owned by such person or group which will have become void), in whole or in part, at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock, or a fractional share of Preferred Stock (or of a share of a similar class or series of the Company's preferred stock having similar rights, preferences and privileges) of equivalent value, per Right (subject to adjustment). With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in such Purchase Price. No fractional shares of Preferred Stock will be issued (other than fractions which are integral multiples of one one-thousandth of a share of Preferred Stock, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) and in lieu thereof, an adjustment in cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred Stock on the last trading day prior to the date of exercise. At any time prior to the time an Acquiring Person becomes such, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per Right (the "REDEMPTION PRICE"). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price. For so long as the Rights are then redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Rights Agreement in any manner. After the Rights are no longer redeemable, the Company may, except with respect to the Redemption Price, amend the Rights Agreement in any manner that does not adversely affect the interests of holders of the Rights. C-3
Until a Right is exercised or exchanged, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. A copy of the Rights Agreement is available free of charge from the Company. This summary description of the Rights does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 99.1 FOR: Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. 500 Glenpointe Centre West Teaneck, NJ 07666 CONTACT: Gordon Coburn Chief Financial Officer 201-678-2712 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Investors: Stephanie Prince Press: Brian Maddox/Scot Hoffman FD Morgen-Walke 212-850-5600 shoffman@fdmw.com COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS ADOPTS STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN Teaneck, NJ, March 5, 2003 - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) today announced that its Board of Directors approved the adoption of a stockholder rights plan. The stockholder rights plan was adopted in connection with the recently completed exchange offer in which IMS Health Incorporated exchanged its shares of Cognizant's Class B common stock for shares of outstanding IMS Health common stock and ceased to be Cognizant's controlling stockholder. The rights plan was adopted to improve the ability of the Board of Directors to protect the interests of Cognizant and its stockholders in the event of an unsolicited proposal to acquire a significant interest in Cognizant. Adoption of the rights plan was not a response to any known effort to acquire Cognizant. Under the rights plan, one Right has been declared for each share of common stock outstanding on March 17, 2003. The Rights will continue to be represented by, and trade with, Cognizant's common stock certificates unless the Rights become exercisable. The Rights become exercisable (with certain exceptions) only in the event that a person or group acquires, or announces a tender or exchange offer for, 15% or more of the shares of Cognizant's common stock. The Rights will expire on March 5, 2013, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Board of Directors. A summary of the Rights, containing further details of the Rights Plan, will be mailed to stockholders of record shortly after the Rights are distributed.

Cognizant's core competencies include web-centric applications, data warehousing, component-based development and legacy and client-server systems. Cognizant provides the IT services it offers using an integrated onsite/offshore business model. This seamless onsite/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located in India and Ireland. Cognizant began its IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun-off from the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant completed its initial public offering. On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health Incorporated ("IMS Health"). Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding stock of Cognizant (representing all of Cognizant's Class B common stock) and held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock. Holders of Cognizant's Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizant's Class B common stock have ten votes per share. On June 30, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of UHCI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. UHCI previously provided, and will continue to provide through CTS Ireland, application development and maintenance services, using the existing staff of approximately 70 software professionals. This acquisition is designed to enable the Company to provide a wide range of services to the Company's clients in Europe and worldwide and represents the initial implementation of the Company's previously announced international expansion strategy. Additionally, on October 29, 2002, the Company completed the transfer of Silverline Technologies, Inc.'s practice, which serviced a major financial services company to the Company. Under the terms of the transfer, the Company will provide application design, development and maintenance services to such major financial services company through an acquired workforce of approximately three hundred IT and support professionals located primarily in the United States and India. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned (a total of 33,872,700 shares) in an exchange offer to its stockholders. IMS Health distributed 0.927 shares of Cognizant Class B common stock to its stockholders for every one share of IMS Health's common stock tendered. There was no impact on the number of Cognizant's total shares of common stock outstanding as a result of the completion of the exchange offer. As a direct result of the IMS Health exchange offer Cognizant has incurred charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $1.7 million and expects total charges aggregating approximately $3.5 million. Such charges primarily relate to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. In addition, total estimated charges include approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split-off. As of February 21, 2003, pursuant to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common stock converted into shares of Class A common stock. Accordingly, as of such date, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements and all applicable references to the number of outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, as well as IMS Health's ownership interest have not been restated to reflect the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock. Stockholders' equity accounts will subsequently be restated to reflect the exchange offer. On March 5, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a 3-for-1 stock split effected by a 200% stock dividend payable on April 1, 2003 to stockholders of record on March 19, 2003. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been restated. Appropriate adjustments have been made in the exercise price and number of shares subject to stock options. Stockholders' equity accounts have been restated to reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued common shares from the additional paid in capital account to the common stock accounts. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RISKS Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the Company. In addition, Financial Reporting Release No. 61 requires all companies to includes a discussion to address, among other things, liquidity, off-balance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. 13
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for warranties, reserves for employee benefits, income taxes, depreciation of fixed assets and long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed-bid contracts. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. Most of the Company's IT development centers, including a substantial majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. To date, the Company has not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Company's services are entered into on either a time-and-materials or fixed-price basis. Revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts that provide for application development services or that provide for a combination of application development and application management services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of performance is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract's cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Revenues related to fixed-priced contracts that provide solely for application management services are recognized on a straight-line basis or as services are rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contract terms. Expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus in EITF 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". The consensus, which is effective for contracts entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, requires that a Company evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. That evaluation must be performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered. Arrangement consideration should be then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. EITF 00-21 indicates that the best evidence of fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand-alone basis. Fair value evidence often consists of entity-specific or vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value. The Company enters into contracts that could be considered arrangements with multiple deliverables. These contracts are primarily long-term fixedbid contracts that provide both application maintenance and application development services. As indicated above and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company accounts for such contracts using percentage of completion accounting. The Company is currently evaluating the prospective impact of EITF 00-21 on the Company's results of operations related to contracts entered into after June 15, 2003. Fixed-price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, are recognized as either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. A reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts, which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period. Revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when agreements or work orders are signed or payment is received; however the cost related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services are rendered. Such revenue is recognized when, and if, evidence of an arrangement is obtained, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The assets and liabilities of the Company's Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity. For the Company's Indian subsidiary ("CTS India"), the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between CTS India and its U.S. affiliates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in other income. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its 14
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and on-going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Cognizant's Indian subsidiary, CTS India, is an export-oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of CTS India are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 90% exemption from Indian income tax. These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and under current law will be completely phased out by March of 2009. Prior to 2002, it was management's intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, Cognizant has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24.9 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, Cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, Cognizant intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Bulletin 23, Cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on the repatriation of earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately $30.1 million. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, Cognizant will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to deter- mine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation. This change in intent, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India, resulted in an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 23.4%. This rate compares to an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 37.4%. Effective April 1, 2002, the government of India passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which the Company's earnings are taxed in India. The tax exemption for export earnings was reduced from 100% to 90%, a surtax was imposed increasing the effective rate from 35.7% to 36.75% for income that is subject to tax, and the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was replaced with a withholding tax on dividends. Cognizant's cash requirements could change over time, which could effectively force it to change its intent on repatriating Indian earnings. If Cognizant's earnings are intended to be repatriated in the future, or are no longer reinvested outside the United States, Cognizant will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2002. These increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on Cognizant's business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as cash flows to fund such taxes. In addition, Cognizant may need to accelerate the payment of significant deferred taxes, which would have a significant impact on its cash position. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Prior to 2002, goodwill, which related to the acquisition of the former minority interest in the Company's Indian subsidiary, was amortized using the straight-line basis over a period of seven years. Effective January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142"), the Company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance; however, at each balance date, the Company does evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on Cognizant's business, results of operations and financial condition. LONG-LIVED ASSETS. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which was adopted in 2002, the Company reviews for impairment long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, the Company will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. 15
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 28.9%, or approximately $51.3 million, from approximately $177.8 million during 2001 to approximately $229.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in application management and application development and integration services. The Company provides services through time and materials ("T&M") and fixed-bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years revenues recognized under fixed-bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001 and 24.6% in 2002. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand for such services due to the customer's ability to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. Sales to related parties on a year-over-year basis were 10.6% in 2001 compared to 8.9% in 2002. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2002, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Company's cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Company's cost of revenues increased by 35.1%, or approximately $31.9 million, from approximately $90.8 million during 2001 to approximately $122.7 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Company's technical professionals from approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001 to over 6,100 employees at December 31, 2002. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Company's services and on employees acquired through acquisitions. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Company's gross profit increased by 22.4%, or approximately $19.5 million, from approximately $86.9 million during 2001 to approximately $106.4 million during 2002. Gross profit margin decreased from 48.9% of revenues during 2001 to 46.4% of revenues in 2002. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to the significantly increased performance of the Company. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 19.2%, or approximately $9.9 million, from approximately $51.3 million during 2001 to approximately $61.2 million during 2002, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 28.9% to 26.7%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Company's sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Company's growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Company's expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, from approximately $35.6 million during 2001 to approximately $45.2 million during 2002, representing approximately 20.0% and 19.7% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment, and in 2002, split-off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health has offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of the Company's Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income decreased by approximately 27.7%, from approximately $2.5 million during 2001 to approximately $1.8 million during 2002. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001 compared to an exchange loss of approximately $235,000 during 2002, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Company's transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Company's equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax 16
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS benefit, was approximately $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company recognized split-off costs of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the exchange offer and expects total charges aggregating approximately $3.5 million in relation to one-time costs associated with the exchange offer. Such charges primarily relate to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. In addition, total estimated charges include approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split-off. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $13.2 million in 2001 to approximately $10.5 million in 2002, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in 2001 and 23.4% in 2002. The lower effective tax rate reflects Cognizant's change in its intention regarding the repatriation of 2002 and future earnings from its subsidiary in India, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $22.2 million in 2001 to approximately $34.6 million in 2002, representing approximately 12.5% and 15.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2002 primarily reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company, operating globally, provides software services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of software services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of software services principally in the United Kingdom. Asian operations consist of software services principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by the Company's chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. In this regard, revenues are allocated to each geographic area based on the location of the customer. NORTH AMERICAN SEGMENT REVENUE. Revenue increased by 31.4%, or approximately $47.7 million, from approximately $151.9 million during 2001 to approximately $199.6 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the onsite/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Company's services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 29.4%, or approximately $8.9 million, from approximately $30.4 million during 2001 to approximately $39.4 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. EUROPEAN SEGMENT REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.1%, or approximately $3.7 million, from approximately $24.2 million during 2001 to approximately $27.9 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Company's sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Company's services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 13.2%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.9 million during 2001 to approximately $5.5 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. ASIAN SEGMENT REVENUE. Revenue was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $1.6 million in each year. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $0.3 million in each year. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 29.7%, or approximately $40.7 million, from approximately $137.0 million during 2000 to approximately $177.8 million in 2001. This increase resulted primarily from approximately a $27.7 million (42.9%) increase in application management and approximately a $13.5 million (18.8%) increase in application development and integration, partially offset by an approximately $0.5 million (100.0%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The Company provides services through T&M and fixed-bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years fixed-bid contracts have increased as a percent of revenues from 15.0% in 1999 to 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001. Sales to related parties on a year-over-year basis were relatively stable at 10.6% in 2001 compared to 10.4% in 2000. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2000, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Company's cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Company's cost of revenues increased by 29.0%, or approximately $20.4 million, from approximately $70.4 million during 2000 to approximately $90.8 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Company's technical professionals from approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000 to approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Company's services. The Company's gross profit increased by 30.5%, or approximately $20.3 million, from approximately $66.6 million during 2000 to approximately $86.9 during 2001. Gross profit margin increased 17
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS from 48.6% of revenues during 2000 to 48.9% of revenues in 2001. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed-bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 26.8%, or approximately $10.8 million, from approximately $40.5 million during 2000 to approximately $51.3 million during 2001, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.5% to 28.9%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Company's sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Company's growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Company's expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 36.3%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $26.1 million during 2000 to approximately $35.6 million during 2001, representing approximately 19.1% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed-bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment. Interest income decreased by approximately 5.6%, from approximately $2.6 million during 2000 to approximately $2.5 million during 2001. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Company's transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Company's equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million or $0.02 per diluted share. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Company had been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. The Company's provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Company's stand-alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.6 million in 2000 to approximately $13.2 million in 2001, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both years. The provision for income taxes reflects the Company's intent to repatriate earnings from its Indian subsidiary. NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $17.7 million in 2000 to approximately $22.2 million in 2001, representing approximately 12.9% and 12.5% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The lower percentage in 2001 reflects the one-time write-off of the Company's investment in Questra, discussed previously. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT NORTH AMERICAN SEGMENT REVENUE. Revenue increased by 32.2%, or approximately $37.0 million, from approximately $114.9 million during 2000 to approximately $151.9 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the onsite/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Company's services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 38.9%, or approximately $8.5 million, from approximately $21.9 million during 2000 to approximately $30.4 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. EUROPEAN SEGMENT REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.6%, or approximately $3.3 million, from approximately $21.0 million during 2000 to approximately $24.2 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Company's sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Company's services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 21.7%, or approximately $0.9 million, from approximately $4.0 million during 2000 to approximately $4.9 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. ASIAN SEGMENT REVENUE. Revenue increased by 42.5%, or approximately $0.5 million, from approximately $1.1 million during 2000 to approximately $1.6 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Company's success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies as well as to Indian divisions of the Company's multi-national clients. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 50.5%, or approximately $0.1 million, from approximately $0.2 million during 2000 to approximately $0.3 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. 18
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million. The Company has used and plans to use such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including its offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related businesses, and formation of joint ventures; and (iii) general corporate purposes, including working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $56.7 million, $32.1 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from increased net income, increased accrued employee incentive payments, which resulted in higher levels of year-end accrued liabilities, increased tax benefits related to stock plans, offset, in part, by a greater increase in accounts receivable then the prior year. The increase in 2001 as compared to 2000 results primarily from increased levels of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, increased net income and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset, by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $20.5 million at December 31, 2000 to approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2001 and to approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2000 and to approximately $5.4 million at December 31, 2001 and decreased to approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2002 was due primarily to increased revenue. The decrease in unbilled accounts receivable in 2002 compared to the prior year was primarily related to timing of fixed- bid contractual billings. The Company monitors turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports which are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by the Company's finance staff. At December 31, 2002, the Company's day's sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 56 days as compared to 59 days and 50 days at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company's investing activities used net cash of approximately $35.5 million, $14.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflects the Company's increased purchases of property and equipment to expand the Company's offshore development infrastructure and the acquisitions of intangible assets related to UHCI and Silverline Technologies, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The increase in 2001 of net cash used in investing activities as compared to 2000 primarily reflects an increase in purchases of property and equipment. In June 2000, the Company announced a strategic relationship with Trident Capital, a leading venture capital firm, to jointly invest in emerging e-business service and technology companies. In accordance with this strategy, the Company invested approximately $2 million in Questra, an e-business software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for an initial 5.8% equity interest. Trident Capital also independently made a direct investment in Questra. Based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Company's equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights, the Company recorded an impairment loss for the full $2.0 million original investment in recognition of an other than temporary impairment. The Company's investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Company's financing activities provided net cash of approximately $20 million, $6 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. The Company believes that its available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations, will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. The Company's ability to expand and grow its business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet its long-term capital requirements beyond this 12-month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which its cash flow increases, its ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, its continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, its ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, between the Company and IMS Health (the "Distribution Agreement"), especially as it relates to tax indemnities and the availability to the Company of public and private debt and equity financing. The Company cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to it, if at all. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million and $85 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 the Company had no significant third party debt. The Company had working capital of approximately $134.3 and $95.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate any near-term liquidity issues. The Company does not engage in hedging activities nor has it entered into off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As of December 31, 2002, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments related to its India development center expansion program of approximately $28.8 million, of which approximately $19.2 million has been spent. The multi-phase program will encompass the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 620,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Calcutta. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $35.6 million, which the Company expects to fund internally. 19

Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002 are as follows:

Cognizant is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Cognizant's quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of Cognizant's engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its customers' business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customer's computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against Cognizant, regardless of Cognizant's responsibility for such failure. Although Cognizant attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering its application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect Cognizant from liability for damages. Although Cognizant has general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against Cognizant that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in Cognizant's insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on Cognizant's business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of the IMS Health split-off, the Company has entered into certain agreements and indemnifications (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES As indicated in Notes 1 and 9 and 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has entered into various agreements with IMS Health, who owned a majority and controlling interest in the outstanding common stock of the Company (55.3%) and held approximately 92.5% of the combined voting power of the Company's common stock at December 31, 2002. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health completed its plan to distribute all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in the exchange offer, which is the subject of Amendment No. 4 to Form S-4 Registration Statement filed by the Company on January 30, 2003. As of the completion of such distribution, IMS Health is no longer a related party of Cognizant. INTERCOMPANY SERVICES AGREEMENT Prior to the consummation of the exchange offer, pursuant to the terms of an Intercompany Services Agreement, dated as of May 15, 1998, IMS Health provided the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permitted the Company to participate in IMS Health's business insurance plans. In prior periods, IMS Health provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have now been transitioned to the Company. Costs for all periods prior to the Company's IPO were allocated to the Company based on utilization of certain specific services. All subsequent services were performed and charged to the Company under the CTS/IMS Health intercompany services agreement that was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. IMS Health and Cognizant entered into an amended and restated Intercompany Services Agreement, effective following the consummation of the exchange offer, which provides for the continued provision of payroll, payables processing and certain other administrative services for a term of up to one year. MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides IT services to IMS Health. The IT services are provided to IMS Health on terms that are comparable to unrelated third parties. The same is true for IT services provided to former affiliates of The Dun and Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation, former parents of the Company, and former and present affiliates of IMS Health. In 2002, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $20.4 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2001, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $18.8 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2000, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $14.3 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies (through August 30, 2000). DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT The Company and IMS Health entered into the Distribution Agreement, the terms of which have been approved by a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which was comprised of the Company's independent directors. The Distribution Agreement sets forth certain rights and obligations of IMS Health and the Company in respect of the exchange offer in addition to those provided in the Intercompany Agreement. For a more complete description of the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we urge you to read the entire Distribution Agreement, which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to Amendment No. 4 to Form S-4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on January 30, 2003. AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION DIRECTOR RESIGNATIONS. IMS Health caused David M. Thomas and Nancy E. 20
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cooper to resign as of the consummation of the exchange offer from their positions as directors of the Company and from any boards of directors of the Company's subsidiaries on which they served. INDEMNIFICATION. IMS Health and the Company have agreed to indemnification provisions in respect of the respective disclosure in the exchange offer documents, the conduct of the exchange offer and any failure to perform the Distribution Agreement. JOINT AND SEVERAL UNDERTAKINGS. IMS Health requested, as a condition to the distribution of the Company's shares in the exchange offer, that the Company agree to undertake to be jointly and severally liable to certain of IMS Health's prior affiliates for liabilities arising out of or in connection with IMS Health's business and the businesses of the Company and other successors to the businesses of Cognizant Corporation in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement dated as of October 28, 1996, among Cognizant Corporation, which has been renamed Nielsen Media Research, Inc., The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which has been renamed the R.H. Donnelly Corporation and ACNielsen Corporation and related agreements. In addition, IMS Health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from the Company to Nielsen Media Research and Synavant Inc. with respect to liabilities allocated to IMS Health in connection with the Distribution Agreement, dated as of June 30, 1998, between Nielsen Media Research, Inc. and IMS Health and related agreements and the Distribution Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2000, between IMS Health and Synavant Inc. The Company has agreed to deliver these undertakings. However, subject to the general allocation of liabilities arising from the respective businesses of IMS Health and the Company, IMS Health has agreed to indemnify and reimburse the Company for liabilities incurred with respect to these undertakings. COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS. In addition to the Intercompany Services Agreement, IMS Health and the Company agreed to the continuation of certain commercial relationships between the companies for a period of at least three years. INSURANCE. The Distribution Agreement includes provisions governing the administration of certain insurance programs and procedures for making claims and it also allocates the right to proceeds and the allocation of deductibles under these programs. TAX. The Distribution Agreement provides that IMS Health and the Company will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the exchange offer will be taxable to IMS Health if the exchange offer is part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50% or greater interest, based on either vote or value, in IMS Health or the Company. If IMS Health becomes subject to tax under Section 355(e) of the Code, its tax liability will be based upon the difference between the fair market value of the Cognizant Class B common stock at the time of the exchange offer and IMS Health's adjusted basis in the Cognizant Class B common stock at that time. This tax liability could be a material amount. If a breach by the Company of the representations made by it to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion or the covenants in the distribution agreement is the "but for" cause of the exchange offer either failing to qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355(a) of the Code or becoming taxable to IMS Health under Section 355(e) of the Code, then the Company has agreed to indemnify IMS Health and each member of the consolidated group of which IMS Health is a member from and against any liability, including any taxes, interest or penalties or additions to tax, that is imposed upon IMS Health or any member of its consolidated group as a result of the exchange offer becoming taxable under Section 355 of the Code. The Company will be entitled to rely upon certain representations made by IMS Health to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion. In the event any of these representations are not true, correct or complete, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify IMS Health or the members of its consolidated group against any liability arising under Section 355 of the Code if the Company's breach of a representation would not have resulted in this type of liability had all of IMS Health's representations made in connection with McDermott, Will & Emery's tax opinion been true, complete and correct. As a result of the representations made to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion and the covenants in the Distribution Agreement, the acquisition of control of the Company during the two-year period following the exchange offer may be more difficult or less likely to occur because of the potential indemnification liability associated with a breach of these representations or covenants. In addition, the Company's ability to undertake acquisitions and other transactions may be substantially restricted during the two-year period following the exchange offer. OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS In December 2001, the Company paid IMS Health a one-time fee of approximately $825,000 under an alliance agreement in which the Company was named "vendor of choice" for IT services to the pharmaceutical industry. This agreement was negotiated between the parties on an arms-length basis. In addition, the Company has a strategic business relationship with The TriZetto Group Inc. that includes helping its healthcare customers integrate TriZetto's products with their existing information systems and, within TriZetto, supporting further development of these software applications. As of December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned approximately 26.4% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. During 2002 the Company recorded revenues from TriZetto of approximately $2.6 million and expenses related to TriZetto commissions and marketing fees of approximately $0.7 million. During 2001 the Company recorded revenues from TriZetto of approximately $401,000 and payments related to TriZetto commissions and marketing fees of approximately $1.0 million. 21
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The assets and liabilities of the Company's Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity. For the Company's Indian subsidiary, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars; and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between the Indian subsidiary and the Company's U.S. affiliates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. A portion of the Company's costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on the Company's results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Company's most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for its programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services offered by the Company have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, the Company must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on its fixed-price contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that it charges for its services in the United States and elsewhere. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS During 2002 and 2001, various accounting pronouncements were issued which may impact the Company's financial statements. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company", "Cognizant", or "CTS") is a leading provider of custom IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in the United States and Europe. Cognizant's core competencies include web-centric applications, data warehousing, component-based development and legacy and client-server systems. Cognizant provides the IT services it offers using an integrated onsite/offshore business model. This seamless onsite/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located onsite at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located in India and Ireland. Cognizant began its IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun-off from the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant completed its initial public offering of its Class A common stock (the "IPO"). On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health Incorporated ("IMS Health"). Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding stock of Cognizant (representing all of Cognizant's Class B common stock) and held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock. Holders of Cognizant's Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizant's Class B common stock have ten votes per share. On January 30, 2003, the Company filed a tender offer in which IMS Health stockholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for Cognizant Class B common stock held by IMS Health. There will be no impact on the number of Cognizant's total shares outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) On February 13, 2003, IMS Health completed its plan to distribute all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer. There is no impact on the number of Cognizant's total shares outstanding as a result of the completion of the exchange offer. As of February 21, 2003, pursuant to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all 33,872,700 shares of Class B common stock converted into shares of Class A common stock. Accordingly, as of such date, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding and the share and equity balances that relate to Class B common stock will be reclassed to the share and equity balances of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements and all applicable references to the number of outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, as well as IMS Health's ownership interest have not been restated to reflect the exchange offer. Stockholders' equity accounts will subsequently be restated to reflect the reclassification of the share and equity balances that relate to Class B common stock to the share and equity balances of Class A common stock. On March 5, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a 3-for-1 stock split of Class A common stock effected by a 200% stock dividend payable on April 1, 2003 to stockholders of record on March 19, 2003. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying financial statements, and all applicable references to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information has been restated. Appropriate adjustments have been made in the exercise price and number of shares subject to stock options. Stockholders' equity account have been restated to reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued common shares from the additional paid in capital account to the common stock accounts. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as if it were a separate entity for all periods presented. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents primarily include time and demand deposits in the Company's operating bank accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit-worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables. INVESTMENTS. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control or the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies are accounted for under the cost method. Investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while renewals and betterments are capitalized. PURCHASED SOFTWARE. Purchased software that is intended for internal use is capitalized, including the salaries and benefits of employees that are directly involved in the installation of such software. The capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line method over the lesser of three years or its useful life. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the former minority interest in the Company's Indian subsidiary over the fair values of amounts assigned to the net assets acquired. Amortization expense had been recorded using the straight-line method over a period of seven years. Amortization expense was $317 for each of the years 28
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Accumulated amortization was $1,345 and $1,028 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Effective January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142"), the Company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance; however, the Company does evaluate goodwill for impairment, in accordance with FAS 142, at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. Other intangibles represent primarily customer relationships and assembled workforce, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years and 5-8 years, respectively. The Company evaluates such intangibles for impairment in accordance with FAS 142, at each balance sheet date LONG-LIVED ASSETS. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which was adopted in 2002, the Company reviews for impairment long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, the Company will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Company's services are entered into on either a time-and-materials or fixed-price basis. Revenues related to time-and-material contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed-price contracts that provide for highly complex information technology application development services or that provide for a combination of application development and application maintenance services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of performance is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contract's cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Revenues related to fixed-priced contracts that provide solely for application maintenance services are recognized on a straight-line basis or as services are rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contractual terms. Expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period. Fixed price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, are recognized as either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates of certain fixed contracts are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. A reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts, which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period. Revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when agreements or work orders are signed or payment is received; however the cost related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services are rendered. Such revenue is recognized when, and if, evidence of an arrangement is obtained. ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS. At December 31, 2002, the Company has four stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 8. The company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations." No stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to stock-based employee compensation. UNBILLED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Unbilled accounts receivable represent rev- enues on contracts to be billed, in subsequent periods, as per the terms of the contracts. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The assets and liabilities of the Company's Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders' equity. For the Company's Indian subsidiary ("CTS India"), the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between CTS India and its U.S. affiliates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in other income. 29
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for warranties, reserves for employee benefits, depreciation of fixed assets and long-lived assets, contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for applicable fixed-bid contracts, income tax expense and related deferred assets and liabilities, and purchase price allocation related to intangible and tangible assets acquired. Results could vary from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. All of the Company's software development centers, including a substantial majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. To date, the Company has not engaged in any significant hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo-political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local or cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions in investment-grade, short-term debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial issuer. INCOME TAXES. The Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits associated with a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is provided. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. CTS India is an export-oriented company, which under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim a tax holiday for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of the Company's Indian subsidiary are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 90% exemption from Indian income tax. These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and under current law will be completely phased out by 2009. In prior periods, it was management's intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, the Company has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24,935 on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, the Company intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Bulletin 23, the Company has not accrued taxes on the repatriation of earnings recognized in 2002 as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately $30,059. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, the Company would accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. This change in intent, as well as a change in the second quarter in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India, resulted in an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 23.4%. This rate compares to an effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 of 37.4%. Deferred U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings from other foreign entities have not been provided for as it is the Company's intent to reinvest such earnings. Such income taxes are immaterial. NET INCOME PER SHARE. Basic earnings per share ("EPS") excludes dilution and is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS includes all potential dilutive common stock in the weighted average shares outstanding (See note 14). RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2002 presentation. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Adopted: In June 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("FAS 141") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142") were issued. FAS 141 requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. FAS 141 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. FAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that there may be an impairment. At December 31, 2002, the Company evaluated 30
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) both goodwill and intangible assets and concluded that they had not been impaired. FAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of FAS 141 and FAS 142 did not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The following table sets forth the Company's results had FAS 142 been applied to the prior-period financial statements presented herein. In August 2001, Statement of Financial Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets" ("FAS 144") was issued. FAS 144 supersedes Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived Assets to be Disposed of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently occurring Events and Transactions." FAS 144 also amends ARB ("Accounting Research Bulletins") No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary. FAS 144 retains the fundamental provisions of FAS 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while resolving significant implementation issues associated with FAS 121. Among other things, FAS 144 provides guidance on how long-lived assets used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when long-lived assets are held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for long-lived assets that will be disposed of other than by sale. FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of FAS 144 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations. In April 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" ("FAS 145") was issued. FAS 145 updates, clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements and is generally effective for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FAS 123" (FAS 148) was issued. FAS 148 amends FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation", to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has adopted these amended disclosure requirements (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) under the heading "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Plans" and will implement the required interim disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2003. Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted: In June 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("FAS 143") was issued. FAS 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs that result from the acquisition, construction, or development and normal operation of a long-lived asset. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, FAS 143 requires an increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life. FAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, "Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities" ("FAS 146") was issued. FAS 146 addresses the accounting for costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease, costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees, and involuntary termination benefits under one-time benefit arrangements that are not an ongoing benefit program or an individual deferred compensation contract. A liability for contract termination costs should be recognized and measured at fair value either when the contract is terminated or when the entity ceases to use the right conveyed by the contract. A liability for onetime termination benefits should be recognized and measured at fair value at the communication date if the employee would not be retained beyond a minimum retention period (i.e., either a legal notification period or 60 days, if no legal requirement exists). For employees that will be retained beyond the minimum retention period, a liability should be accrued ratably over the future service period. The provisions of the statement will be effective for disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus in EITF 00-21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". The consensus, which is effective for contracts entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, requires that a Company should evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. That evaluation must be performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered. Arrangement consideration should be then allocated among the separate 31
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) units of accounting based on their relative fair values. EITF 00-21 indicates that the best evidence of fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a standalone basis. Fair value evidence often consists of entity-specific or vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value. The Company enters into contracts that could be considered arrangements with multiple deliverables. These contracts are primarily long-term fixed-bid contracts that provide both application maintenance and application development services. As indicated in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company accounts for such contracts using percentage of completion accounting, which is the prevailing industry practice. The Company is currently evaluating the possible prospective impact of EITF 00-21 on the Company's results of operations related to contracts entered into after June 15, 2003. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment consist of the following: Depreciation expense was $7,516, $6,368 and $4,507 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following: 4. INVESTMENTS On June 30, 2002, Cognizant Technology Solutions Ireland Limited ("CTS Ireland"), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from UnitedHealthcare Ireland Limited ("UHCI"), a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, for $3,043 (including approximately $143 of direct deal costs). In accordance with FAS 142, this transaction was determined to be an acquisition of assets, not a business combination. UHCI previously provided, and will continue to provide through CTS Ireland, application development and maintenance services, using the existing staff of approximately 70 software professionals. The acquisition of the assets of UHCI, is designed to enable the Company to provide a wide range of services to the Company's clients in Europe and worldwide and represents the initial implementation of the Company's previously announced international expansion strategy. In accordance with FAS 142, the Company has allocated, based upon an independent appraisal, the purchase price to the UHCI tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. The details of the allocation and the respective useful lives over which these assets are being amortized are provided in the table below. Amortization of $148, related to the acquisition of these assets, has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six-month period ended December 31, 2002. Such net assets, excluding amounts assigned to fixed assets, have been included as intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as identifiable assets in the European segment in Note 12. The operating results of CTS Ireland have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company effective July 1, 2002. On October 29, 2002, the Company completed the transfer of Silverline Technologies, Inc.'s ("Silverline") practice, which serviced a major financial services company to the Company for $10,424 (including approximately $620 of direct deal costs). In accordance with FAS 142, this transaction was determined to be an acquisition of assets, not a business combination. Under the terms of the transfer, the Company will provide application design, development and maintenance services to such major financial services company through an acquired workforce of approximately 300 IT and support professionals located primarily in the United States and India. Amortization of $178, related to the acquisition of these assets, has been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two-month period ended December 31, 2002. Such net assets have been included as intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and as identifiable assets in the North American segment in Note 12. Since the transfer was effected on October 29, 2002, the operating results of this transfer have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company commencing from that date. The operating results of UHCI and Silverline, for the periods included indicated above, were not material to the consolidated operating results of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2002. 32
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) The purchase price for UHCI and Silverline's financial services company practice was allocated to the following tangible and intangibles assets and is being amortized over the useful lives indicated below: The estimated aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets for each of the succeeding five fiscal years is; 2003 through 2006: $1,362, 2007: $1,342. In June 2000, the Company announced a strategic relationship with Trident Capital, a leading venture capital firm, to jointly invest in emerging e-business service and technology companies. In accordance with this strategy, the Company invested $1,955 in Questra Corporation ("Questra"), an e-business software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for a 5.8% equity interest. Trident Capital also independently made a direct investment in Questra. The Company's investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting. The Company reviews for impairment certain assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Questra issued Preferred B shares in exchange for $19 million of new venture capital financing. Since the Company did not participate, its ownership interest in Preferred A shares was reduced from 5.8% to 2.1%. Based on the implied fair value of Questra, as measured by the latest round of financing, and considering the preferential liquidation rights that the Preferred B shareholders received, the Company has concluded that it will not recover its investment in Questra and has recorded an impairment loss of $1,955 to recognize the other than temporary decline in value of its investment. 5. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Beginning in 1997, certain U.S. employees of the Company were eligible to participate in Cognizant Corporation's and now IMS Health's 401(k) plan. The Company matches up to 50.0% of the eligible employee's contribution. The amount charged to expense for the Company's matching contribution was $0, $0, and $31 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In 2000, the Company established a 401(k) plan, which certain U.S. employees of the Company became eligible to participate in. The Company matches up to 50.0% of the eligible employee's contribution. The amount charged to expense for the matching contribution was $479, $351 and $195 for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 and 2000, respectively. Certain of the Company's employees participate in IMS Health's defined benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan in the United Kingdom and Ireland sponsored by the Company. The costs to the Company recognized as postretirement benefit costs and related liabilities were not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position for the years presented. (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) CTS India maintains an employee benefit plan that covers substantially all India-based employees. The employees' provident fund, pension and family pension plans are statutory defined contribution retirement benefit plans. Under the plans, employees contribute up to twelve percent of their base compensation, which is matched by an equal contribution by CTS India. Contribution expense recognized was $928, $790, and $501 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. CTS India also maintains a statutory gratuity plan that is a statutory postemployment benefit plan providing defined lump sum benefits. CTS India makes annual contributions to an employees' gratuity fund established with a government-owned insurance corporation to fund a portion of the estimated obligation. The Company estimates its obligation based upon employees' salary and years of service. Expense recognized by the Company was $752, $902, and $511 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 6. INCOME TAXES Income before provision for income taxes consisted of the following for years ended December 31: The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following for the years ended December 31: The following table sets forth the significant differences between the U.S. federal statutory taxes and the Company's provision for income taxes for consolidated financial statement purposes: 33
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) The Company's deferred tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following at December 31: Cognizant has generated net operating losses for U.S. tax purposes of approximately $8.6 million. These losses have an expiration date for Federal purposes through 12/31/22. For state purposes, the date of expiration varies but will generally be less than the Federal expiration period. Cognizant's Indian subsidiary, CTS India, is an export-oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of CTS India are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 90% exemption from Indian income tax. These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and under current law will be completely phased out by March of 2009. Prior to 2002, it was management's intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, Cognizant has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24,935 on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, Cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, Cognizant intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Bulletin 23, Cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on the repatriation of earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately $30,059. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, Cognizant will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation. This change in intent, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India, resulted in an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 23.4%. This rate compares to an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 37.4%. Deferred U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings from other foreign entities have not been provided for as it is the Company's intent to reinvest such earnings. Such income taxes are immaterial. 7. CAPITAL STOCK On June 24, 1998, the Company consummated its IPO of 17,502,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $1.67 per share, 15,000,000 of which were issued and sold by the Company and 2,502,000 of which were sold by Cognizant Corporation, the Company's then majority owner and controlling parent company. The net proceeds to the Company from the IPO were approximately $22,407 after $843 of direct expenses. In July 1998, IMS Health (the accounting successor to Cognizant Corporation) sold 2,625,300 shares of Class B common stock, which were converted to Class A common stock pursuant to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters of the IPO. Of the total net proceeds received by the Company upon the consummation of its IPO, approximately $6,637 was used to repay the related party balance then owed to Cognizant Corporation. The related party balance resulted from certain advances to the Company from Cognizant Corporation used to purchase the minority interest of the Company's Indian subsidiary and to fund payroll and accounts payable. Concurrent with the IPO, the Company reclassified the amounts in mandatorily redeemable common stock to stockholders' equity as the redemption feature was voided. On June 12, 1998, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to authorize 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share, 15,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $.01 per share, and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.10 per share, and effected a 0.65 for one reverse stock split. Holders of Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock have ten votes per share. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). No preferred stock has been issued. On May 23, 2000, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of authorized Class B common Stock from 15,000,000 shares to 25,000,000 shares. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding stock of Cognizant (representing all of Cognizant's Class B common stock) and held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizant's common stock. Holders of Cognizant's Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizant's Class B common stock have ten votes per share. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) On January 30, 2003, the Company filed a tender offer in which IMS Health shareholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for Cognizant Class B common stock held by IMS Health. There will be no impact on the number of Cognizant's total shares outstanding upon the completion of the exchange offer. As a direct result of the IMS Health exchange offer, Cognizant has incurred charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $1.7 million related to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health completed its plan to distribute all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer. There is no impact on the number of Cognizant's total shares outstanding as a result of the completion of the exchange offer. As of February 21, 2003, pursuant to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all 33,872,700 shares of Class B common stock converted into shares of Class 34
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) A common stock. Accordingly, as of such date, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding and the share and equity balances that relate to Class B common stock will be reclassed to the share and equity balances of Class A common stock. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock has not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements and all applicable references to the number of outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, as well as IMS Health's ownership interest have not been restated to reflect the exchange offer. Stockholders' equity accounts will subsequently be restated to reflect the reclassification of the share and equity balances that relate to Class B common stock to the share and equity balances of Class A common stock. On March 5, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a 3-for-1 stock split of Class A common stock effected by a 200% stock dividend payable on April 1, 2003 to stockholders of record on March 19, 2003. The stock split has been reflected in the financial statements, and all applicable references to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information has been restated. Appropriate adjustments have been made in the exercise price and number of shares subject to stock options. Stockholders' equity account have been restated to reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued common shares from the additional paid in capital account to the common stock accounts. 8. EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS In July 1997, CTS adopted a Key Employees Stock Option Plan, which provides for the grant of up to 4,192,500 stock options (each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company's Class A common stock.) to eligible employees. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. As a result of the IPO, all options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over four years and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. In December 1997, CTS adopted a Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan, which provides for the grant of up to 429,000 stock options (each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company's Class A common stock.) to eligible directors. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. As a result of the IPO, all options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over two years and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. In March 1998, CTS granted non-qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of 292,500 shares of Class A common stock to CTS's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at an exercise price of $4.61 per share, an amount less than the then fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the grant. The Company has recorded the related compensation expense over the vesting period of these options. In May 1999, CTS adopted the 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan, which provides for the grant of up to 6,000,000 stock options (each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company's Class A common stock) to eligible employees, nonemployee Directors and independent contractors. Options granted under this plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. All options have a life of ten years, vest proportionally over four years, unless specified otherwise, and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. On May 23, 2000, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of shares available for issuance under this plan from 6,000,000 to 9,000,000 shares. On May 30, 2001, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number of shares available for issuance under this plan from 9,000,000 to 18,000,000. In May 1999, CTS adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Purchase Plan"), which provides for the issuance of up to 2,400,000 shares of CTS Class A common stock to eligible employees. The Purchase Plan provides for eligible employees to designate in advance of specified purchase periods a percentage of compensation to be withheld from their pay and applied toward the purchase of such number of whole shares of Class A common stock as can be purchased at a price of 90% of the lesser of (a) the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the first date of the purchase period; or (b) the fair market value of a share of Class A common stock on the last date of the purchase period. No employee can purchase more than $25,000 worth of stock annually, and no stock can be purchased by any person which would result in the purchaser owning more than five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company. In accordance with APB 25, no compensation expense was recorded in connection with the purchase of shares by employees. During the year ended December 31, 2002, approximately 84,000 shares of Class A common stock were purchased by employees under the Purchase Plan. At December 31, 2002, there were approximate 2,125,815 shares available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. A summary of the Company's stock option activity, and related information is as follows as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: 35
2 0 0 2 C O G N I Z A N T F I N A N C I A L R E V I E W NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (in thousands, except share and per share data) At December 31, 2002, 5,182,293 options (each option exercisable into one (1) share of the Company's Class A common stock) were available for future issuance under the Company's option plans. The following summarizes information about the Company's stock options outstanding and exercisable by price range at December 31, 2002: Compensation cost recognized by the Company under APB 25 was $0, $11, and $35 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based compensation plans, as well as the IMS Health options held by certain executive officers (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below: The pro forma disclosures shown above are not representative of the effects on net income and earnings per share in future years. For purposes of pro forma disclosures only, the fair value for all Company options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option model with the following weighted average assumptions in 2002: risk-free interest rate of 2.71%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, expected volatility of 65% and weighted average expected life of 2.9 years. 2001 assumptions; risk-free interest rate of 4.3%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, expected volatility of 78% and weighted average expected life of 3.0 years. 2000 assumptions; risk-free interest rate of 6.1%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, expected volatility of 75% and expected life of 3.9 years. The weighted-average fair value of the Company's options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $6.68, $5.56, and $7.24, respectively. 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES REVENUES. The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides certain IT services to IMS Health. The Company recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling $20,429 and $18,809 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2000, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $14,273, including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies, a then affiliated subsidiary, (through August 30, 2000). AFFILIATED AGREEMENTS. In 1997, the Company entered into various agreements with Cognizant Corporation, which were assigned to IMS Health as part of the 1998 Reorganization. The agreements included an Intercompany Services Agreement for services provided by IMS Health such as payroll and payables processing, tax, real estate and risk management services, a License Agreement to use the "Cognizant" trade name and an Intercompany Agreement. On July 1, 1998, IMS Health transferred all of its rights to the "Cognizant" name and related trade and service marks to the Company. SERVICES. In 2002 and 2001, IMS Health provided the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permitted the Company to participate in IMS Health's business insurance plans. In prior periods, IMS Health provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have now been transitioned to the Company. All services were performed under the CTS/IMS Health intercompany services agreement. Total costs charged to the Company by IMS Health in connection with these services were $656, $440 and $254 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In December 2001, the Company paid IMS Health a one-time fee of approximately $825 under an alliance agreement in which the Company was named "vendor of choice" for IT services to the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, the Company has a certain relationship with the former Erisco Managed Care Technologies ("Erisco"), which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Trizetto Group, Inc. ("Trizetto"). As of December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned approximately 26.4% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. During 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded revenues from Erisco of approximately $2,577 and $401, respectively and payments to Erisco for commissions and marketing fees of approximately $697 and $1,012, respectively. PENSION PLANS. Certain U.S. employees of the Company participated in IMS Health's defined benefit pension plans. The plans are cash balance pension plans under which six percent of creditable compensation plus interest is credited to the employee's retirement account on a monthly basis. The cash balance earns monthly investment credits based on the 30-year Treasury bond yield. At the time of retirement, the vested employee's account balance is actuarially converted into an annuity. The Company's cost for these plans is included in the allocation of expense from IMS Health for employee benefits plans. 36

(formerly known as Strategic Technologies) shares that occurred on August 30, 2000. At December 31, 2002 after adjusting for the Reorganization, the split of IMS Health's stock and the distribution of Gartner Group and Synavant Inc. shares, such officer had 172,297 options in IMS Health outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $15.96 per share. At December 31, 2002, 172,297 options were exercisable. In November 1996, Cognizant Corporation granted an executive officer options to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 shares (on a pre-split basis) of the common stock of Cognizant Corporation at an exercise price of $33.38 per share. In addition, in November 1996, such executive officer was granted options to purchase an aggregate of 20,000 shares (on a pre-split basis) of the common stock of Cognizant Corporation at an exercise price of $33.38 per share, which was equal to the fair market value at the grant date, by paying ten percent of the option exercise price as an advance payment toward such exercise. The unvested portion of such advance payment is refundable under certain conditions. The remaining 90 percent is payable at exercise. In July 1998, IMS Health granted an executive officer options to purchase an aggregate of 9,106 shares (on a pre-split basis) of the common stock of IMS Health at an exercise price of $30.17 per share. All remaining such options have since been converted into options to purchase the common stock of IMS Health as a result of the Reorganization, the two-for-one split of IMS Health stock, the distribution of Gartner Group and Synavant Inc. shares discussed above. At December 31, 2002, after adjusting for the Reorganization, the split of IMS Health's stock and the distribution of Gartner Group and Synavant Inc. shares, such officer had 127,379 options in IMS Health outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $15.96 per share. At December 31, 2002, 127,379 options were exercisable. 10. COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2002, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments related to its India development center expansion program of approximately $28.8 million, of which $19.2 million has been spent as of December 31, 2002. The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2011. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002 are as follows:
2003 $ 5,799 2004 3,829 2005 2,229 2006 1,755 2007 1,252 Thereafter 2,090 - --------------------------------------------------- Total minimum lease payments $ 16,954 ===================================================
Rental expense totaled $5,201, $3,175 and $3,472 for years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 11. CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of the Company's engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its customers' business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customer's computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Company's responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering its software development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect the Company from liability for damages. Although the Company has general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against the Company that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in the Company's insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. 12. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company, operating globally, provides software services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of software services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of software services principally in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Asian operations consist of software services principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales 37

Teaneck, NJ  July 26, 2004  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT services, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Highlights for the second quarter include:
Revenue for the second quarter increased to $138.7 million, up 16% from $119.7 million in the first quarter of 2004, and up 59% from $87.4 million in the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the second quarter increased to $23.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $19.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share (on a split-adjusted basis) in the first quarter of 2004. Operating margin for the quarter increased to 20.0%, compared to 19.8% in the first quarter of 2004 and 19.6% in the second quarter of 2003.
"The second quarter was exceptionally strong as we reported substantially better than expected results with solid growth across all of our key verticals," stated Lakshmi Narayanan, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Application development services continued to show strong momentum, growing 77% year-over-year as a result of Cognizant's success at winning complex development projects. Our focus on building long-term customer relationships has led to increased client penetration and opportunities to cross-sell our services to existing and new strategic customers, enabling Cognizant to grow faster than any of our peers in the industry. Additionally, approximately 90% of revenue came from clients with whom we have worked for at least one year. We also continue to strengthen our position as a highly differentiated provider of offshore outsourcing services as reflected in our ongoing ability to broaden and deepen our relationships with existing clients while maintaining a high win-rate against our competitors."
 
2004 Outlook
"In addition to our strong revenue and margin performance during the quarter, we are particularly pleased with our cash flow metrics, including a decline in DSO to 59 days and generation of over $30 million of cash from operations," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer of Cognizant. "Based on the strength of our new business pipeline and the continuing interest from prospective customers, we remain very optimistic about our growth opportunities for the remainder of 2004 and believe that Cognizant is well-positioned to benefit from its leadership position and the ongoing momentum in the offshore outsourcing market."

Exhibit 99.2
Teaneck, NJ  October 26, 2004  Cognizant (Nasdaq: CTSH), a leading provider of IT services, today announced plans to further expand the Company's India-based Techno-complex capacity in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore. The Company also announced that it will construct a new training academy in Chennai.
Today's announced plan supersedes the Company's facility investment plan announced in December 2003. The new facilities will add approximately 830,000 square feet of space to house approximately 9,000 employees, as well as approximately 100,000 square feet of educational space for use by Cognizant's training academy.
Cognizant expects to spend approximately $76 million on the expanded construction program and land purchases, an increase of approximately $34 million compared to the expansion program announced in December 2003.
"Clients have been ramping up their offshore programs, including application development and maintenance projects, even more rapidly than the already high levels we had anticipated," said Lakshmi Narayanan, President and CEO of Cognizant. "The increasing number of large organizations deciding to initiate outsourcing is resulting in higher demand for our industry leading services. Our sustained high growth rate in revenue and headcount has not only provided the opportunity for us to begin the second phase of building our additional facilities, but for us to now expand those already substantial plans."
"Last November, we completed the first phase of facility construction," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer of Cognizant. "That initial program provided space for close to 6,000 employees and was completed on-time and on-budget. Phase Two was launched earlier this year with plans to construct approximately 600,000 square feet of development space. Due to our robust growth this year, we saw the requirement to further expand our capacity in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, as well as
 
construct a major training academy in Chennai. In addition, Cognizant will continue to add leased facilities to supplement our expanded construction program."
Photos of Cognizant's recently completed buildings in India are available in the "About Us" section of Cognizant's website at www.cognizant.com.

Teaneck, NJ  February 10, 2005  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT services, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2004.
Financial Highlights  Fourth Quarter 2004
Revenue for the fourth quarter increased to $172.8 million, up 11% from $155.4 million in the third quarter of 2004, and up 60% from $108.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net income for the fourth quarter increased to $30.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share compared to $17.7 million or $0.13 per diluted share (on a split-adjusted basis) in the fourth quarter of 2003. Operating margin for the quarter increased to 20.4%, compared to 19.8% in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Financial Highlights  Full Year 2004
Revenue for 2004 increased to $586.7 million, up 59% from $368.2 million in 2003. Net income for the full year increased to $100.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $57.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share (on a split-adjusted basis) in 2003.
 
"We are pleased with Cognizant's strong results in the fourth quarter and full year of 2004, which outpaced the performance of the industry overall," said Lakshmi Narayanan, President and CEO of Cognizant. "We attribute our growth to a number of factors, all of which reflect the success of our focus on providing customers with business-driven technology solutions through our onsite, offshore model. In the fourth quarter, we continued to expand existing client relationships through cross-selling an ever increasing range of high value services. We also experienced continued traction within Europe, as well as strong growth overall across our financial services, healthcare, manufacturing and retail verticals."
Business Highlights
Cognizant added over 1,300 associates in the fourth quarter, ending the year with approximately 15,300 employees  an increase of over 6,000 for the full year. These hires include engineering graduates, MBA's, senior level architects and program managers. Construction on close to one million square feet of additional facilities has also moved ahead and is on schedule.
"In 2004 we delivered a number of highly complex projects to clients who engaged Cognizant to help them solve major business challenges with the strategic application of IT solutions," continued Mr. Narayanan. "To address this demand, we introduced several new service offerings over the course of the year. This includes our previously announced Technology Consulting and Advanced Solutions Group, which offers domain, technology and enterprise application expertise to help clients extend, enhance, and leverage new and existing IT investments. Additionally, we introduced our industry-leading testing service, which focuses exclusively on supporting our clients' testing needs through independent verification and validation of their internal software. Our significant number of strategic clients and enhanced service offerings allowed us to build upon our strong momentum and extend our platform for growth in 2005 and beyond."
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
2005 Outlook  First Quarter & Full Year
"In addition to our strong revenue and margin performance during 2004, we are particularly pleased with our cash flow metrics, including the generation of over $120 million of cash from operations during the year," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial Officer of Cognizant. "This resulted in a year-end DSO of 59 days and a cash and short-term deposit balance of over $314 million."
"Our 60% revenue growth in the fourth quarter is a clear indication that we are consistently growing faster than our competition," added Mr. Coburn. "We continue to enhance our high level of business execution quality by accelerating reinvestment in the Company. Our recruitment and training programs continue to ramp at a rapid pace, and, as a result of our ongoing investment in infrastructure and the recruitment and training of our highly skilled staff, Cognizant is well positioned for strong performance in both the first quarter and full year of 2005. Based on the current demand environment, we anticipate a 50% year-over-year increase in revenue for the first quarter to $180 million, and anticipate full year revenue to top $845 million."
 
The Company is evaluating the timing and effects of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, which affects accounting for stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation. This revised statement was issued in December 2004 and is effective July 1, 2005. The Company's guidance for 2005 does not reflect the effect of applying the new accounting rules.

Item 8.01. Other Events.
At the 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, held on June 13, 2006 (the "Annual Meeting"), the stockholders of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company") reelected Venetia Kontogouris and Thomas M. Wendel as Class III directors to serve until the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In addition, stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation that increased the maximum number of authorized shares of the Company's capital stock, all classes, from 340,000,000 shares, consisting of 325,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, to 515,000,000 shares, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and 15,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders also approved the Company's Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (As Amended and Restated Through April 12, 2006) (the "Incentive Plan"). As described in the Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable under the Incentive Plan was increased from 37,500,000 to 38,261,580 shares and an additional 761,580 shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights or pursuant to other stock or stock-based awards granted under the Incentive Plan. In approving the Incentive Plan, stockholders also re-approved the series of performance criteria that may be utilized in establishing specific targets to be attained as a condition to the vesting of one or more cash or stock-based awards under the Incentive Plan so as to qualify the compensation attributable to those awards as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the foregoing approval, the number of shares issuable under the Company's Key Employees Stock Option Plan has been reduced by 761,580 shares so that they total number of shares available for issuance under the Company's equity compensation plans remains unchanged. The other material changes effected by the amendment of the Incentive Plan are described in the Company's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2006. The Company's stockholders also ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2006.

Appropriate adjustments may also be made by the Committee in the terms of any Awards granted under the Plan to reflect such changes or distributions and to modify any other terms of outstanding Awards on an equitable basis, including modifications of performance goals and changes in the length of performance periods; provided, however, that with respect to Performance-Based Awards, such modifications and/or changes do not disqualify the compensation attributable to such Awards as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m). In addition, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan, any adjustment with respect to an ISO due to a change or distribution described in this Section 5.2 shall comply with the rules of Code Section 424(a), and in no event shall any adjustment be made which would render any ISO granted hereunder other than an incentive stock option for purposes of Code Section 422.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, such Awards that are cancelled or repriced shall continue to be counted in determining such maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be granted to any single Participant during the life of the Plan.

With respect to Nonemployee Directors and Independent Contractors who become Participants, the Committee may grant such Participants only Nonqualified Stock Options. Each Stock Option shall be subject to such terms and conditions consistent with the Plan as the Committee may impose from time to time. In addition, each Stock Option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions set forth in Sections 7.2 through 7.8 below.

The Committee shall specify the Vesting Date with respect to each Stock Option in the Award Agreement. The Committee may grant Stock Options that are Vested, either in whole or in part, on the date of grant. If the Committee fails to specify a Vesting Date in the Award Agreement, 25 percent of such Stock Option shall become exercisable on each of the first 4 anniversaries of the date of grant and shall remain exercisable following such anniversary date until the Stock Option expires in accordance with its terms under the Award Agreement or under the terms of the Plan. The Vesting of a Stock Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee, including, without limitation, accelerating the Vesting if certain performance goals are achieved.
7.4 VESTING DATE.
The Stock Option exercise price may be paid in cash or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, by the delivery of shares of Common Stock then owned by the Participant, by the withholding of shares of Common Stock for which a Stock Option is exercisable, or by a combination of these methods. In the sole discretion of the Committee, payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the exercise price. To facilitate the foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with one or more brokerage firms. The Committee may prescribe any other method of paying the exercise price that it determines to be consistent with applicable law and the purpose of the Plan, including, without limitation, in lieu of the exercise of a Stock Option by delivery of shares of Common Stock then owned by a Participant, providing the Company with a notarized statement attesting to the number of shares owned by the Participant, where upon verification by the Company, the Company would issue to the Participant only the number of incremental shares to which the Participant is entitled upon exercise of the Stock Option. In determining which methods a Participant may utilize to pay the exercise price, the Committee may consider such factors as it determines are appropriate; provided, however, that with respect to ISOs, all such discretionary determinations by the Committee shall be made at the time of grant and specified in the Award Agreement.
7.5 EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.
In addition to being subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7, ISOs shall comply with all other requirements under Code Section 422. Accordingly, ISOs may be granted only to Participants who are employees (as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.421-7(h)) of the Company or of any "Parent Corporation" (as defined in Code Section 424(e)) or of any "Subsidiary Corporation" (as defined in Code Section 424(f)) on the date of grant. The aggregate market value (determined as of the time the ISO is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which ISOs (under all option plans of the Company and of any Parent Corporation and of any Subsidiary Corporation) are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. For purposes of the preceding sentence, ISOs shall be taken into account in the order in which they are granted. ISOs shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by such Participant. The Committee shall not grant ISOs to any Employee who, at the time the ISO is granted, owns stock possessing (after the application of the attribution rules of Code Section 424(d)) more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Parent Corporation or of any Subsidiary Corporation unless the exercise price of the ISO is fixed at not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and the exercise of such ISO is prohibited by its terms after the 5th anniversary of the ISO's date of grant. In addition, no ISO shall be issued to a Participant in tandem with a Nonqualified Stock Option issued to such Participant in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 14a.422A-1, Q/A-39.
7.6 RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO ISOS.
The Committee may, by way of the Award Agreements or otherwise, establish such other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any Stock Option, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan, including, without limitation, the requirement that the Participant not engage in competition with the Company.
7.7 ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant a Stock Option to any holder of an option (hereinafter referred to as an "Original Option") to purchase shares of the stock of any corporation:
7.8 CONVERSION STOCK OPTIONS.
the stock or assets of which were acquired, directly or indirectly, by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
(a)
which was merged with and into the Company or a Subsidiary,
(b)
so that the Original Option is converted into a Stock Option (hereinafter referred to as a "Conversion Stock Option"); provided, however, that such Conversion Stock Option as of the date of its grant (the "Conversion Stock Option Grant Date") shall have the same economic value as the Original Option as of the Conversion Stock Option Grant Date. In addition, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion determines otherwise, a Conversion Stock Option which is converting an Original Option intended to qualify as an ISO shall have the same terms and conditions as applicable to the Original Option in accordance with Code Section 424 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder so that the conversion (x) is treated as the issuance or assumption of a stock option under Code Section 424(a) and (y) is not treated as a modification, extension or renewal of a stock option under Code Section 424(h).
8.0 SARS
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant SARs to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors. An SAR is a right to receive a payment in cash, Common Stock or a combination of both, in an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, or other specified valuation, of a specified number of shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, or other specified valuation (which shall be no less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock), of such shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is granted, all as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that if a SAR is granted retroactively in tandem with or in substitution for a Stock Option, the designated Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in the Award Agreement may be the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date such Stock Option was granted. Each SAR shall be subject to such terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, a provision that automatically converts a SAR into a Stock Option on a conversion date specified at the time of grant, as the Committee shall impose from time to time in its sole discretion and subject to the terms of the Plan.
8.1 IN GENERAL.
9.0 STOCK AWARDS AND STOCK UNITS
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Stock Awards to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors as additional compensation or in lieu of other compensation for services to the Company. A Stock Award shall consist of shares of Common Stock which shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion determines appropriate including, without limitation, restrictions on the sale or other disposition of such shares, the Vesting Date with respect to such shares, and the right of the Company to reacquire such shares for no consideration upon termination of the Participant's employment within specified periods. The Committee may require the Participant to deliver a duly signed stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Common Stock covered by such Stock Award and/or that the stock certificates evidencing such shares be held in custody or bear restrictive legends until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed. With respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to a Stock Award, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a holder of shares of Common Stock, including the right to receive dividends and to vote the shares, unless the Committee determines otherwise on the date of grant.
9.1 STOCK AWARDS.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractor Stock Units as additional compensation or in lieu of other compensation for services to the Company. A Stock Unit is a hypothetical share of Common Stock represented by a notional account established and maintained (or caused to be established or maintained) by the Company for such Participant who receives a grant of Stock Units. Stock Units shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate including, without limitation, determinations of the Vesting Date with respect to such Stock Units and the criteria for the Vesting of such Stock Units. A Stock Unit granted by the Committee shall provide for payment in shares of
9.2 STOCK UNITS.
Common Stock at such time or times as the Award Agreement shall specify. The Committee shall determine whether a Participant who has been granted a Stock Unit shall also be entitled to a Dividend Equivalent Right.
Subject to a Participant's election to defer in accordance with Section 17.3 below, upon the Vesting of a Stock Unit, the shares of Common Stock representing the Stock Unit shall be distributed to the Participant, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides for the payment of the Stock Unit in cash (or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common Stock) equal to the value of the shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be distributed to the Participant.
9.3 PAYOUT OF STOCK UNITS.
10.0 PERFORMANCE SHARES AND PERFORMANCE UNITS
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Performance Shares to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors as additional compensation or in lieu of other compensation for services to the Company. A Performance Share shall consist of a share or shares of Common Stock which shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate including, without limitation, determining the performance goal or goals which, depending on the extent to which such goals are met, will determine the number and/or value of the Performance Shares that will be paid out or distributed to the Participant who has been granted Performance Shares. Performance goals may be based on, without limitation, Company-wide, divisional and/or individual performance, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine, and may be based on the performance measures listed in Section 12.3 below.
10.1 PERFORMANCE SHARES.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors Performance Units as additional compensation or in lieu of other compensation for services to the Company. A Performance Unit is a hypothetical share or shares of Common Stock represented by a notional account which shall be established and maintained (or caused to be established or maintained) by the Company for such Participant who receives a grant of Performance Units. Performance Units shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate including, without limitation, determining the performance goal or goals which, depending on the extent to which such goals are met, will determine the number and/or value of the Performance Units that will be accrued with respect to the Participant who has been granted Performance Units. Performance goals may be based on, without limitation, Company-wide, divisional and/or individual performance, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine, and may be based on the performance measures listed in Section 12.3 below.
10.2 PERFORMANCE UNITS.
With respect to those Performance Shares or Performance Units that are not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Awards (as described in Section 12 below), the Committee shall have the authority at any time to make adjustments to performance goals for any outstanding Performance Shares or Performance Units which the Committee deems necessary or desirable unless at the time of establishment of the performance goals the Committee shall have precluded its authority to make such adjustments.
10.3 ADJUSTMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS.
Subject to a Participant's election to defer in accordance with Section 17.3 below, upon the Vesting of a Performance Share or a Performance Unit, the shares of Common Stock representing the Performance Share or the Performance Unit shall be distributed to the Participant, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides for the payment of the Performance Share or a Performance Unit in cash (or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common Stock) equal to the value of the shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be distributed to the Participant.
10.4 PAYOUT OF PERFORMANCE SHARES OR PERFORMANCE UNITS.
11.0 CASH AWARDS
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Cash Awards to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors as additional compensation or in lieu of other compensation for services to the Company. A Cash Award shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate including, without limitation, determining the Vesting Date with respect to such Cash Award, the criteria for the Vesting of such Cash Award, and the right of the Company to require the Participant to repay the Cash Award (with or without interest) upon termination of the Participant's employment within specified periods.
11.1 IN GENERAL.
12.0 PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may designate Awards granted under the Plan as Performance-Based Awards (as defined below) if it determines that such compensation might not be tax deductible by the Company due to the deduction limitation imposed by Code Section 162(m). Accordingly, an Award granted under the Plan may be granted in such a manner that the compensation attributable to such Award is intended by the Committee to qualify as "performance-based compensation" (as such term is used in Code Section 162(m) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) and thus be exempt from the deduction limitation imposed by Code Section 162(m) ("Performance-Based Awards").
12.1 IN GENERAL.
Awards shall only qualify as Performance-Based Awards under the Plan if:
12.2 QUALIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.
at the time of grant the Committee is comprised solely of two or more "outside directors" (as such term is used in Code Section 162(m) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder);
(a)
with respect to either the granting or Vesting of an Award (other than (i) a Nonqualified Stock Option or (ii) an SAR, which are granted with an exercise price at or above the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant), such Award is subject to the achievement of a performance goal or goals based on one or more of the performance measures specified in Section 12.3 below;
(b)
the Committee establishes in writing (i) the objective performance-based goals applicable to a given performance period and (ii) the individual employees or class of employees to which such performance-based goals apply no later than 90 days after the commencement of such performance period (but in no event after 25 percent of such performance period has elapsed);
(c) 
no compensation attributable to a Performance-Based Award will be paid to or otherwise received by a Participant until the Committee certifies in writing that the performance goal or goals (and any other material terms) applicable to such performance period have been satisfied;
(d)
after the establishment of a performance goal, the Committee shall not revise such performance goal (unless such revision will not disqualify compensation attributable to the Award as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m)) or increase the amount of compensation payable with respect to such Award upon the attainment of such performance goal; and
(e)
no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of such performance goals may be waived with respect to Performance-Based Awards, except in the event of a Change in Control or certain involuntary terminations of employment or service prior to the completion of the performance period.
(f)
The Committee may use the following performance measures (either individually or in any combination) to set performance goals with respect to Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Awards: net sales; pretax income before allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; budget; cash flow; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the Common Stock or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; market share; gross profits; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; increase in number of customers; and/or reductions in costs. The performance measures may, at the time they are established for one or more such Performance-Based Awards, be subject to adjustment for one or more of the following items: extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain, loss or expense; items of gain, loss or expense related to (a) the disposal of a business or discontinued operations or (b) the operations of any business acquired by the Company; accruals for reorganization and restructuring cost and expenses; and items of gain, loss or expense attributable to changes in tax laws and regulations, accounting principles or other applicable laws or regulations.
12.3 PERFORMANCE MEASURES.
As required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(vi), the material terms of performance goals as described in this Section 12 shall be disclosed to and reapproved by the Company's stockholders no later than the first stockholder meeting that occurs in the 5th year following the year in which the Company's stockholders previously approved such performance goals.
12.4 STOCKHOLDER REAPPROVAL.
13.0 CHANGE IN CONTROL
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if there is a Change in Control of the Company, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may take such actions as it deems appropriate with respect to outstanding Awards, including, without limitation, accelerating the Vesting Date and/or payout of such Awards; provided, however, that such action shall not conflict with any provision contained in an Award Agreement unless such provision is amended in accordance with Section 16.3 below.
13.1 ACCELERATED VESTING.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, all or a portion of certain outstanding Awards shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the holders, and each such holder shall receive an amount equal to the value of such Award on the date of the change in control, and with respect to each share of Common Stock subject to a Stock Option or SAR, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the occurrence of such change in control over the exercise price per share of such Stock Option or SAR. Such amount shall be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of property (including the property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
13.2 CASHOUT.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that an Award may be assumed by any entity which acquires control of the Company or may be substituted by a similar award under such entity's compensation plans.
13.3 ASSUMPTION OR SUBSTITUTION OF AWARDS.
14.0 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IF PARTICIPANT IS AN EMPLOYEE
Subject to any written agreement between the Company and a Participant, if a Participant's employment is terminated due to death or Disability:
14.1 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH OR DISABILITY.
all non-Vested portions of Awards held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death or the date of the termination of his or her employment, as the case may be, shall immediately be forfeited by such Participant as of such date; and
(a)
all Vested portions of Stock Options and SARs held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death or the date of the termination of his or her employment, as the case may be, shall remain exercisable until the earlier of:
(b)
the end of the 12-month period following the date of the Participant's death or the date of the termination of his or her employment, as the case may be, or
(i)
the date the Stock Option or SAR would otherwise expire.
(ii)
Subject to any written agreement between the Company and a Participant, if a Participant's employment is terminated by the Company for cause, all Awards held by a Participant on the date of the termination of his or her employment for cause, whether Vested or non-Vested, shall immediately be forfeited by such Participant as of such date.
14.2 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR CAUSE.
Subject to any written agreement between the Company and a Participant, if a Participant's employment is terminated for any reason other than for cause or other than due to death or Disability:
14.3 OTHER TERMINATIONS OF EMPLOYMENT.
all non-Vested portions of Awards held by the Participant on the date of the termination of his or her employment shall immediately be forfeited by such Participant as of such date; and
(a)
all Vested portions of Stock Options and/or SARs held by the Participant on the date of the termination of his or her employment shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the end of the 90-day period following the date of the termination of the Participant's employment or (ii) the date the Stock Option or SAR would otherwise expire.
(b)
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that:
14.4 COMMITTEE DISCRETION.
any or all non-Vested portions of Stock Options and/or SARs held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death and/or the date of the termination of his or her employment shall immediately become exercisable as of such date and, except with respect to ISOs, shall remain exercisable until a date that occurs on or prior to the date the Stock Option or SAR is scheduled to expire;
(a)
any or all Vested portions of Nonqualified Stock Options and/or SARs held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death and/or the date of the termination of his or her employment shall remain exercisable until a date that occurs on or prior to the date the Stock Option or SAR is scheduled to expire; and/or
(b)
any or all non-Vested portions of Stock Awards, Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units, and/or Cash Awards held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death and/or the date of the termination of his or her employment shall immediately Vest or shall become Vested on a date that occurs on or prior to the date the Award is scheduled to vest; provided, however, that the Committee shall not exercise such discretion with respect to any Performance-Based Award if and to the extent the provision for such accelerated vesting would otherwise disqualify the compensation attributable to that Award as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m).
(c)
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, (i) the provisions contained in this Section 14 shall be applied to an ISO only if the application of such provision maintains the treatment of such ISO as an ISO and (ii) the exercise period of an ISO in the event of a termination of the Participant's employment due to Disability provided in Section 14.1 above shall be applied only if the Participant is "permanently and totally disabled" (as such term is defined in Code Section 22(e)(3)).
14.5 ISOS.
15.0 TAXES
With respect to Employees, the Company, or the applicable Subsidiary, may require a Participant who has become vested in his or her Stock Award, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit granted hereunder, or who exercises a Stock Option or SAR granted hereunder to reimburse the corporation which employs such Participant for any taxes required by any governmental regulatory authority to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid by such corporation or entity in respect of the issuance or disposition of such shares or the payment of any amounts. In lieu thereof, the corporation or entity which employs such Participant shall have the right to withhold the amount of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from such corporation or entity to the Participant upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe. The corporation or entity that employs such Participant may, in its discretion, hold the stock certificate to which such Participant is entitled upon the vesting of a Stock Award, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit or the exercise of a Stock Option or SAR as security for the payment of such withholding tax liability, until cash sufficient to pay that liability has been accumulated.
15.1 WITHHOLDING TAXES.
With respect to Employees, at any time that the Company, Subsidiary or other entity that employs such Participant becomes subject to a withholding obligation under applicable law with respect to the vesting of a Stock Award, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit or the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option (the "Tax Date"), except as set forth below, a holder of such Award may elect to satisfy, in whole or in part, the holder's related personal tax liabilities (an "Election") by (i) directing the Company, Subsidiary or other entity that employs such Participant to withhold from shares issuable in connection with such vesting or exercise either a specified number of shares or shares of Common Stock having a specified value (in each case limited to the related minimum statutory personal withholding tax liabilities with respect to the applicable taxing jurisdiction so as to preclude any "liability" accounting treatment for the Award pursuant to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), (ii) tendering shares of
15.2 USE OF COMMON STOCK TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING OBLIGATION.
Common Stock previously issued pursuant to the exercise of a Stock Option or other shares of the Common Stock owned by the holder, or (iii) combining any or all of the foregoing Elections in any fashion. An Election shall be irrevocable. The withheld shares and other shares of Common Stock tendered in payment shall be valued at their Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Tax Date. The Committee may disapprove of any Election, suspend or terminate the right to make Elections or provide that the right to make Elections shall not apply to particular shares or exercises. The Committee may impose any additional conditions or restrictions on the right to make an Election as it shall deem appropriate, including conditions or restrictions with respect to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
No person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, the Company and any Subsidiary and their directors, officers, agents and employees makes any representation, commitment, or guarantee that any tax treatment, including, but not limited to, federal, state and local income, estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to amounts deferred under the Plan, or paid to or for the benefit of a Participant under the Plan, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant on account of participation in the Plan.
15.3 NO GUARANTEE OF TAX CONSEQUENCES.
16.0 AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

16.1 TERMINATION OF PLAN.
The Board may amend the Plan at any time with or without prior notice; provided, however, that no action authorized by this Section 16.2 shall reduce the amount of any outstanding Award or change the terms and conditions thereof without the Participant's consent.

(c)
modify the requirements as to eligibility for Awards under the Plan.
(d)
In addition, the Plan shall not be amended without the approval of such amendment by the Company's stockholders if such amendment is (i) required under the rules and regulations of the stock exchange or national market system on which the Common Stock is listed or (ii) otherwise considered material in the reasonable judgment of the Committee.
The Committee may amend or modify any Award Agreement at any time by mutual agreement between the Committee and the Participant or such other persons as may then have an interest therein. In addition, by mutual agreement between the Committee and a Participant or such other persons as may then have an interest therein, Awards may be granted to an Employee, Nonemployee Director or Independent Contractor in substitution and exchange for, and in cancellation of, any Awards previously granted to such Employee, Nonemployee Director or Independent Contractor under the Plan, or any award previously granted to such Employee, Nonemployee Director or Independent Contractor under any other present or future plan of the Company or any present or future plan of an entity which (i) is purchased by the Company, (ii) purchases the Company, or (iii) merges into or with the Company.
16.3 AMENDMENT OR CANCELLATION OF AWARD AGREEMENTS.
17.0 MISCELLANEOUS
Awards granted under the Plan may also be subject to such other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Award granted to any other Participant) as the Committee determines on the date of grant to be appropriate, including, without limitation, for the installment purchase of Common Stock under Stock Options, to assist the Participant in financing the acquisition of Common Stock, for the forfeiture of, or restrictions on resale or other disposition of, Common Stock acquired under
17.1 OTHER PROVISIONS.
any Stock Option, for the acceleration of Vesting of Awards in the event of a change in control of the Company, for the payment of the value of Awards to Participants in the event of a change in control of the Company, or to comply with federal and state securities laws, or understandings or conditions as to the Participant's employment in addition to those specifically provided for under the Plan.
Each Award granted under the Plan to a Participant shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and Stock Options and SARs shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant. In the event of the death of a Participant, each Stock Option or SAR theretofore granted to him or her shall be exercisable during such period after his or her death as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, set forth in the Award Agreement on the date of grant and then only by the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased Participant or the person or persons to whom the deceased Participant's rights under the Stock Option or SAR shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit the transferability of a Stock Option (other than an ISO) by a Participant solely to members of the Participant's immediate family or trusts or family partnerships or other similar entities for the benefit of such persons, and subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the Committee may establish and include in the Award Agreement.
17.2 TRANSFERABILITY.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, allow a Participant to elect to defer the receipt of any compensation attributable to an Award under guidelines and procedures to be established by the Committee after taking into account the advice of the Company's tax counsel.
17.3 ELECTION TO DEFER COMPENSATION ATTRIBUTABLE TO AWARD.
If at any time the Committee shall determine that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares of Common Stock subject to any Award on any securities exchange or under any applicable law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of an Award or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder, such Award may not be exercised, distributed or paid out, as the case may be, in whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
17.4 LISTING OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS.
Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments which the Company may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan. The Plan is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
17.5 NO RIGHT, TITLE, OR INTEREST IN COMPANY ASSETS.
The Participant's rights, if any, to continue to serve the Company as a director, officer, employee, independent contractor or otherwise, shall not be enlarged or otherwise affected by his or her designation as a Participant under the Plan, and the Company or the applicable Subsidiary reserves the right to terminate the employment of any Employee or the services of any Independent Contractor or director at any time. The adoption of the Plan shall not be deemed to give any Employee, Nonemployee Director, Independent Contractor or any other individual any right to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award.
17.6 NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE OR TO GRANTS.
The Committee may grant Awards to individual Participants who are subject to the tax laws of nations other than the United States, and such Awards may have terms and conditions as determined by the Committee as necessary to comply with applicable foreign laws. The Committee may take any action which it deems advisable to obtain approval of such Awards by the appropriate foreign governmental entity; provided, however, that no such Awards may be granted pursuant to this Section 16.6 and no action may be taken which would result in a violation of the Exchange Act or any other applicable law.
17.7 AWARDS SUBJECT TO FOREIGN LAWS.
The Plan, all Awards granted hereunder, and all actions taken in connection herewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws, except as superseded by applicable federal law.
17.8 GOVERNING LAW.
No Award granted under the Plan shall be considered compensation for purposes of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company or any Subsidiary nor affect any benefits or compensation under any other benefit or compensation plan of the Company or any Subsidiary now or subsequently in effect.
17.9 OTHER BENEFITS.
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, Common Stock, Stock Options, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
17.10 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may not, without the consent of the Company's stockholders, reprice any outstanding Award; provided, however, that stock splits, stock dividends and similar events as set forth in Section 5.2 herein shall not be deemed to be a repricing hereunder.
17.11 PROHIBITION ON REPRICING OF OPTIONS.
Except as set forth in Section 14 herein and notwithstanding any other provision set forth in the Plan to the contrary, (a) any Award (other than a Stock Option or SAR) that is not subject to performance criteria shall Vest over a service period of at least three years, with such vesting to occur in equal installments over such three year period, and (b) any Award (other than a Stock Option or SAR) that is subject to performance criteria shall Vest over a performance period of at least 12 months in one or more installments over that period.
17.12 MINIMUM VESTING PERIODS.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
For its internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, Cognizant's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of Cognizant's operating results to that of its competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting FAS 123R, Cognizant's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between Cognizant's operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, Cognizant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with the company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Cognizant's business. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

We performed impressively in several verticals where we continue to make strategic investments  including healthcare and media/information services. We continue to see strong growth in our newer customer markets, particularly Continental Europe, where business more than doubled in the last year."
D'Souza continued, "Our strong financial performance in the quarter and throughout 2006, coupled with our track record of industry-leading growth, is the result of the steadfast execution of our strategy, as we converted investments in our verticals, solutions and geographies into significant growth opportunities.

This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
For its internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, Cognizant's management uses financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of Cognizant's operating results to that of its competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting FAS 123R, Cognizant's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between Cognizant's operating results to those of other companies. In addition, management excluded the income tax benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act in its non-GAAP financial measures since this temporary tax incentive is not likely to recur. Accordingly, Cognizant believes that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with the company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Cognizant's business. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

(e) At the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company") held on June 7, 2007 (the "Annual Meeting"), the Company's stockholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Incentive Plan") that (i) increased the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock of the Company reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan by an additional 3,500,000 shares from 38,261,580 to 41,761,580 share of Class A Common Stock, and (ii) reconfirmed the various performance goals which may be utilized in establishing specific targets to be attained as a condition to the vesting of one or more cash or stock-based awards under the Incentive Plan so as to qualify the compensation attributable to those awards as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The following is a summary of certain principal features of the Incentive Plan. This summary is in all respects qualified by, and subject to, the actual terms and provisions of the Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1. All share numbers in this Form 8-K and the Incentive Plan reflect the two-for-one split of the Class A Common Stock effected on June 17, 2004 and all prior stock splits.
General
The purpose of the Incentive Plan is to:
 
 
Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, all of our employees, all of our non-employee Directors and all of our independent contractors are eligible to receive awards that may be stock-based or payable in cash. However, the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock which may be issued to any one participant over the term of the Incentive Plan is limited to 9,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment, for among other things, a merger, consolidation, reorganization, stock split, or other change in capital structure. Additionally, the maximum dollar amount which any participant may be paid in cash pursuant to awards under the Incentive Plan is limited to $10,000,000 over the term of the Plan. Stockholder approval of the amendment to the Incentive Plan also constituted re-approval of those limitations for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). Such limitations will assure that any deductions to which we would otherwise be entitled upon the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights granted under the Incentive Plan will not be subject to the $1 million limitation on the income tax deductibility of compensation paid per executive officer imposed under Section 162(m). In addition, one or more other awards under the Incentive Plan may also qualify as performance-based compensation that is not subject to the Section 162(m) limitation, if the vesting of those awards
 
is tied to the attainment of one or more of the corporate performance milestones which are discussed below in the section entitled "Performance Vesting" and which were re-approved by the stockholders.
The Incentive Plan terminates on April 13, 2009, unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors. The Board may amend the Incentive Plan, except that no such action can adversely affect awards previously granted. Without stockholder approval, the Board may not:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, stockholder approval is necessary if an amendment is required by the stock exchange or national market system on which the Class A Common Stock is listed. Further stockholder approval will be necessary if any future amendment is considered material in the reasonable judgment of the Compensation Committee.
The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Subject to the provisions of the Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee has the authority, among other things, to do the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Eligibility
As of March 31, 2007, approximately 43,400 employees (including 5 executive officers), 4 non-employee Directors, together with an indeterminate number of independent contractors, were eligible to receive awards under the Incentive Plan.
Types of Awards
Several types of awards are provided for by the Incentive Plan. The awards may be measured in shares of Class A Common Stock or in cash. An award may be designated as a stock option, stock appreciation right, stock award, stock unit, performance share, performance unit or cash.
. The Incentive Plan provides for the granting of options intended to qualify as incentive stock options, or ISOs, as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). The Incentive Plan also provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options, or NQSOs. ISOs may only be granted to employees, and, NQSOs may be granted to employees, non-employee Directors and independent contractors. Except in the event of option assumptions effected under the Incentive Plan in connection with our acquisitions of other companies or businesses, all ISOs and NSOs granted under the Incentive Plan must have an exercise price not less than 100% of fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date. Unless the Compensation Committee specifies otherwise, options granted under the Incentive Plan will vest and become exercisable in four successive equal annual installments upon the optionee's completion of each year of service over the four-year period measured from the grant date. Under the Incentive Plan, ISOs and NQSOs expire 10 years after the grant, subject to earlier termination following cessation of employment.
Stock Options
. Stock appreciation rights ("SARs") entitle their recipients to receive payments in cash, Class A Common Stock or a combination as determined by the Compensation Committee. Any such payments will represent the appreciation in the market value of a specified number of shares from the date of grant until the date of exercise. Such appreciation will be measured by the excess of the fair market value on the exercise date over the exercise price (which may not less than the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the grant date of the SAR or the grant date of any award which the SAR replaces).
Stock Appreciation Rights
. A stock award consists of shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. A grantee of a stock award has all of the rights of a holder of shares of Class A Common Stock, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee on the date of grant.
Stock Awards
. A stock unit is a hypothetical share of Class A Common Stock represented by a notional account maintained for the grantee of the stock unit. Stock units are subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. A stock unit will provide for payment in shares of Class A Common Stock at such time as the award agreement shall specify. The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to pay the stock unit in Class A Common Stock, cash or a combination.
Stock Units
 
. A performance share award consists of shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee, including, among other things, the designation of the performance goals which must be attained as a condition for determining the number and/or value of the performance shares that will be paid out or distributed. The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to pay the performance share in Class A Common Stock, cash or a combination.
Performance Shares
. A performance unit award consists of hypothetical shares of Class A Common Stock represented by a notional account maintained for the grantee of the performance unit award. Performance units are subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee, including, among other things, the designation of the performance goal or goals which must be attained as a condition for determining the number and/or value of the performance units that will be earned. The Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to pay the performance units in Class A Common Stock, cash or a combination.
Performance Unit
. The Compensation Committee may grant cash awards subject to such terms and conditions as it determines appropriate.
Cash Awards
To assure that the compensation attributable to one or more awards made under the Incentive Plan will qualify as performance-based compensation that will not be subject to the $1.0 million limitation on the income tax deductibility of the compensation paid per covered executive officer imposed under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the Compensation Committee will also have the discretionary authority to structure one or more awards of stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units or cash so that the shares of Class A Common Stock subject to those particular awards or the cash value of those awards will vest only upon the achievement of certain pre-established corporate performance goals based on one or more of the following criteria, each of which was re-approved and reconfirmed by the stockholders upon their approval of the amendment to the Incentive Plan: net sales; pretax income before allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; budget; cash flow; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the Class A Common Stock or any of our other publicly-traded securities; market share; gross profits; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; increase in number of customers; and/or reductions in costs. The performance goals may be subject to adjustment for one or more of the following items: extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain, loss or expense; items of gain, loss or expense related to (a) the disposal of a business or discontinued operations or (b) the operations of any business acquired by the Company; accruals for reorganization and restructuring cost and expenses; and items of gain, loss or expense attributable to changes in tax laws and regulations, accounting principles or other applicable laws or regulations.
Performance Vesting.
Awards other than stock option grants and stock appreciation rights will be subject to the following minimum vesting periods: if such award is subject to performance criteria, vesting will occur over a performance period of at least 12 months in one or more installments over that period; and if such award is not subject to performance criteria, vesting will occur over a service period of at least three years, with such vesting to occur in equal installments over such three-year period.
Vesting Period for Certain Awards.
 
In the event a grantee's employment is terminated due to death or disability, all non-vested portions of awards are forfeited. All vested portions of stock options or SARs remain exercisable during the shorter of the remaining stated term of the stock option or SAR or twelve months following the date of death or disability. If a grantee's employment is terminated for cause, as defined in the Incentive Plan, all awards, whether vested or non-vested, are forfeited. If a grantee's employment is terminated for any other reason other than for cause or due to death or disability, all non-vested portions of awards are forfeited, and all vested portions of stock options or SARs remain exercisable during the shorter of the remaining stated term of the award or 90 days following the date of termination. Notwithstanding the above, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, provide that:
Termination of Employment.
 
 
 
However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of performance measures may be waived with respect to awards that are intended at the time of grant to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, except in the event of a change of control or certain involuntary terminations of service or employment prior to the completion of the performance period.
Generally, all awards under the Incentive Plan are nontransferable except by will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. Stock options and SARs are exercisable only by the grantee during his or her lifetime. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may permit the transferability of a stock option (other than an ISO) by a grantee to members of his or her immediate family or trusts or other similar entities for the benefit of such person.
Transferability.
Change in Control
Upon the occurrence of a change in control of Cognizant, as defined in the Incentive Plan, with certain exceptions, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to, among other things, accelerate the vesting of outstanding awards, cancel one or more outstanding awards in return for a cash payment equal to the value of the cancelled award or provide that an award be assumed by the entity which acquires control of us or be substituted by a similar award under such entity's compensation plan.
 
Changes in Capitalization
In the event of any of the following transactions affecting the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock without our receipt of consideration: any recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction or other change in corporate structure effected without our receipt of consideration or in the event of any spin-off transaction or extraordinary dividend or distribution resulting in a substantial reduction to the fair market value of the outstanding Class A Common Stock, equitable adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Incentive Plan, (ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted awards under the Incentive Plan measured in terms of Class A Common Stock, (iii) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise price per share in effect under each outstanding stock option and stock appreciation right and (iv) the number and/or class of securities subject to each other outstanding award under the Incentive Plan and the cash consideration (if any) payable per share All such adjustments will be made in such manner as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate in order to preclude any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the Incentive Plan and the outstanding awards thereunder.
Federal Tax Aspects of the Incentive Plan
The following is a summary of the Federal income taxation treatment applicable to us and the participants who receive awards under the Incentive Plan.
. Options granted under the discretionary grant program may be either incentive stock options which satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code or non-statutory options which are not intended to meet such requirements. The Federal income tax treatment for the two types of options differs as follows:
Option Grants
No taxable income is recognized by the optionee at the time of the option grant, and no taxable income is recognized for regular tax purposes at the time the option is exercised, although taxable income may arise at that time for alternative minimum tax purposes. The optionee will recognize taxable income in the year in which the purchased shares are sold or otherwise made the subject of certain other dispositions. For Federal tax purposes, dispositions are divided into two categories: (i) qualifying and (ii) disqualifying. A qualifying disposition occurs if the sale or other disposition is made more than two (2) years after the date the option for the shares involved in such sale or disposition is granted and more than one (1) year after the date the option is exercised for those shares. If the sale or disposition occurs before these two periods are satisfied, then a disqualifying disposition will result.
Incentive Options.
Upon a qualifying disposition, the optionee will recognize long-term capital gain in an amount equal to the excess of (i) the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of the purchased shares over (ii) the exercise price paid for the shares. If there is a disqualifying disposition of the shares, then the excess of (i) the fair market value of those shares on the exercise date or (if less) the amount realized upon such sale or disposition over (ii) the exercise price paid for the shares will be taxable as ordinary income to the optionee. Any additional gain recognized upon the disposition will be a capital gain.
 
If the optionee makes a disqualifying disposition of the purchased shares, then we will be entitled to an income tax deduction, for the taxable year in which such disposition occurs, equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee as a result of the disposition. We will not be entitled to any income tax deduction if the optionee makes a qualifying disposition of the shares.
No taxable income is recognized by an optionee upon the grant of a non-statutory option. The optionee will in general recognize ordinary income, in the year in which the option is exercised, equal to the excess of the fair market value of the purchased shares on the exercise date over the exercise price paid for the shares, and we will be required to collect the withholding taxes applicable to such income from the optionee.
Non-Statutory Options.
We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee with respect to the exercised non-statutory option. The deduction will in general be allowed for our taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized by the optionee.
. No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a stock appreciation right. The holder will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the stock appreciation right is exercised, in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the exercise date over the base price in effect for the exercised right, and we will be required to collect the withholding taxes applicable to such income from the holder.
Stock Appreciation Rights
We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder in connection with the exercise of the stock appreciation right. The deduction will be allowed for the taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized.
The recipient of unvested shares of Class A Common Stock issued under the Incentive Plan will not recognize any taxable income at the time those shares are issued but will have to report as ordinary income, as and when those shares subsequently vest, an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date over (ii) the cash consideration (if any) paid for the shares. The recipient may, however, elect under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to include as ordinary income in the year the unvested shares are issued an amount equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of those shares on the issue date over (ii) the cash consideration (if any) paid for such shares. If the Section 83(b) election is made, the recipient will not recognize any additional income as and when the shares subsequently vest. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the recipient with respect to the unvested shares. The deduction will in general be allowed for our taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized by the recipient.
Restricted Stock Awards.
No taxable income is recognized upon receipt of a stock/phantom unit. The holder will recognize ordinary income in the year in which the shares subject to that unit are actually issued to the holder. The amount of that income will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance, and we will be required to collect the withholding taxes applicable to such income from the holder. We will be entitled to an income tax deduction
Stock/Phantom Units.
 
equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the holder at the time the shares are issued. The deduction will be allowed for the taxable year in which such ordinary income is recognized.
We anticipate that any compensation deemed paid by us in connection with the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock option shares or the exercise of non-statutory options or stock appreciation rights will qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Code Section 162(m) and will not have to be taken into account for purposes of the $1 million limitation per covered individual on the deductibility of the compensation paid to certain of our executive officers.
Deductibility of Executive Compensation.
Accordingly, the compensation deemed paid with respect to options and stock appreciation rights granted under the Incentive Plan will remain deductible by us without limitation under Section 162(m). However, any compensation deemed paid by us in connection with other awards will be subject to the $1 million limitation, unless the vesting of those awards tied solely to one or more of the performance milestones described above under the section entitled "Performance Vesting".
Tax Withholding
The Compensation Committee may provide any or all holders of stock options, stock appreciation rights or other stock or stock-based awards under the Incentive Plan with the right to utilize either or both of the following methods to satisfy all or part of the federal and state income and employment withholding taxes to which they may become subject in connection with the exercise of their options or stock appreciation rights, the issuance to them of vested shares, or the subsequent vesting of any unvested shares issued to them:
 
 
Accounting Treatment
Pursuant to the accounting standards established by SFAS 123R, we are required to expense all stock-based compensation, commencing with the 2006 fiscal year which began on January 1, 2006. Accordingly, stock options and stock appreciation rights payable in stock which are granted to our employees and non-employee Directors have to be valued at fair value as of the grant date under an appropriate valuation formula, and that value then has to be charged as a direct compensation expense against our reported earnings over the designated vesting period of the award. Similar option expensing was required for any unvested options
 
outstanding on the January 1, 2006 effective date, with the grant date fair value of those unvested options to be expensed against our reported earnings over the remaining vesting period. For shares issuable upon the vesting of stock/phantom units awarded under the Incentive Plan, we are required to amortize over the vesting period a compensation cost equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of the award. If any shares are unvested at the time of their direct issuance under the Incentive Plan, then the fair market value of those shares at that time will be charged to our reported earnings ratably over the vesting period. The issuance of a fully-vested stock bonus will result in an immediate charge to our earnings equal to the fair market value of the bonus shares on the issuance date.
Stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to non-employee consultants will result in a direct charge to our reported earnings based on the fair value of the grant measured on the vesting date of each installment of the underlying shares. Accordingly, such charge will take into account the appreciation in the fair value of the grant over the period between the grant date and the vesting date of each installment comprising that grant.
 
In addition to the approval of an amendment to the Incentive Plan as set forth in Item 5.02 above, at the Annual Meeting, the stockholders of the Company reelected Lakshmi Narayanan and John E. Klein as Class I directors to serve until the 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders also ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2007.

4.8 INDEMNIFICATION.
5.0 SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN
The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which shall be available for grants or payments of Awards under the Plan during its term shall be 41,761,580 shares. Such share reserve includes a share increase of 3,500,000 shares authorized by the Board on April 26, 2007, subject to stockholder approval at the 2007 Annual Meeting. The shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares, shares of issued stock held in the Company's treasury, or both, at the discretion of the Company, and subject to any adjustments made in accordance with Section 5.2 below. Any shares of Common Stock underlying Awards which terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance of such shares shall again be available for grants of Awards under the Plan.

extraordinary dividend, equitable adjustments shall be made by the Committee to (i) the maximum number and kind of shares that may be issued under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award under the Plan, (iii) the maximum number and kind of shares for which Awards measured in shares of Common Stock may be made to any one Participant over the term of the Plan, (iv) the exercise price applicable to outstanding Stock Options and (v) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards. The foregoing adjustments shall be made successively each time any such change shall occur. To the extent the foregoing adjustments are to be made to outstanding Awards, such adjustments shall be effected by the Committee in such manner as the Committee deems appropriate in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of benefits under those Awards. The adjustments determined by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. Appropriate adjustments and modifications may also, in the discretion of the Committee, be made on an equitable basis to any other terms of outstanding Awards under the Plan to reflect such changes or distributions, including modifications of performance goals and changes in the length of performance periods; provided, however, that with respect to Performance-Based Awards, such modifications and/or changes do not disqualify the compensation attributable to such Awards as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m). In addition, the Committee is authorized to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan, (i) any adjustment with respect to an ISO due to a change or distribution described in this Section 5.2 shall comply with the rules of Code Section 424(a), and in no event shall any adjustment be made which would render any ISO granted hereunder other than an incentive stock option for purposes of Code Section 422 and (ii) in the event of a Change in Control, the provisions of Section 13 shall be controlling.

6.2 MAXIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT UNDERLYING CASH-BASED AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN TO ANY SINGLE PARTICIPANT.
7.0 STOCK OPTIONS

With respect to Employees who become Participants, the Committee may grant such Participants ISOs or Nonqualified Stock Options or a combination of both. With respect to Nonemployee Directors and Independent Contractors who become Participants, the Committee may grant such Participants only Nonqualified Stock Options. Each Stock Option shall be subject to such terms and conditions consistent with the Plan as the Committee may impose from time to time. In addition, each Stock Option shall be subject to the following terms and conditions set forth in Sections 7.2 through 7.8 below.
7.1 IN GENERAL.
The Committee shall specify the exercise price of each Stock Option in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that the exercise price of any ISO or Nonqualified Stock Option shall not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
7.2 EXERCISE PRICE.
The Committee shall specify the term of each Stock Option in the Award Agreement; provided, however, that (i) no ISO shall be exercised after the 10th anniversary of the date of grant of such ISO and (ii) no Nonqualified Stock Option shall be exercised after the 10th anniversary of the date of grant of such Nonqualified Stock Option. Each Stock Option shall terminate at such earlier times and upon such conditions or circumstances as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, set forth in the Award Agreement on the date of grant.
7.3 TERM OF STOCK OPTION.
The Committee shall specify the Vesting Date with respect to each Stock Option in the Award Agreement. The Committee may grant Stock Options that are Vested, either in whole or in part, on the date of grant. If the Committee fails to specify a Vesting Date in the Award Agreement, 25 percent of such Stock Option shall become exercisable on each of the first 4 anniversaries of the date of grant and shall remain exercisable following such anniversary date until the Stock Option expires in accordance with its terms under the Award Agreement or under the terms of the Plan. The Vesting of a Stock Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee, including, without limitation, accelerating the Vesting if certain performance goals are achieved.
7.4 VESTING DATE.
The Stock Option exercise price may be paid in cash or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, by the delivery of shares of Common Stock then owned by the Participant, by the withholding of shares of Common Stock for which a Stock Option is exercisable, or by a combination of these methods. In the sole discretion of the Committee, payment may also be made by delivering a properly executed exercise notice to the Company together with a copy of irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sale or loan proceeds to pay the exercise price. To facilitate the foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with one or more brokerage firms. The Committee may prescribe any other method of paying the exercise price that it determines to be consistent with applicable law and the purpose of the Plan, including, without limitation, in lieu of the exercise of a Stock Option by delivery of shares of Common Stock then owned by a Participant, providing the Company with a notarized statement attesting to the number of shares owned by the Participant, where upon verification by the Company, the Company would issue to the Participant only the number of incremental shares to which the Participant is entitled upon exercise of the Stock Option. In determining which methods a Participant may utilize to pay the exercise price, the Committee may consider such factors as it determines are appropriate; provided, however, that with respect to ISOs, all such discretionary determinations by the Committee shall be made at the time of grant and specified in the Award Agreement.
7.5 EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.
In addition to being subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7, ISOs shall comply with all other requirements under Code Section 422. Accordingly, ISOs may be granted only to Participants who are employees (as described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.421-7(h)) of the Company or of any "Parent Corporation" (as defined in Code Section 424(e)) or of any "Subsidiary Corporation" (as defined in Code Section 424(f)) on the date of grant. The aggregate market value (determined as of the time the ISO is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which ISOs (under all option plans of the Company and of any Parent Corporation and of any Subsidiary Corporation) are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. For purposes of the preceding sentence, ISOs shall be taken into account in the order in which they are granted. ISOs shall not be transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by such Participant. The Committee shall not grant ISOs to any Employee who, at the time the ISO is granted, owns stock possessing (after the application of the attribution rules of Code Section 424(d)) more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or of any Parent Corporation or of any Subsidiary Corporation unless the exercise price of the ISO is fixed at not less than 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and the exercise of such ISO is prohibited by its terms after the 5th anniversary of the ISO's date of grant. In addition, no ISO shall be issued to a Participant in tandem with a Nonqualified Stock Option issued to such Participant in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 14a.422A-1, Q/A-39.
7.6 RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO ISOS.
The Committee may, by way of the Award Agreements or otherwise, establish such other terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, of any Stock Option, provided they are not inconsistent with the Plan, including, without limitation, the requirement that the Participant not engage in competition with the Company.

(a)
which was merged with and into the Company or a Subsidiary,
(b)
so that the Original Option is converted into a Stock Option (hereinafter referred to as a "Conversion Stock Option"); provided, however, that such Conversion Stock Option as of the date of its grant (the "Conversion Stock Option Grant Date") shall have the same economic value as the Original Option as of the Conversion Stock Option Grant Date. In addition, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion determines otherwise, a Conversion Stock Option which is converting an Original Option intended to qualify as an ISO shall have the same terms and conditions as applicable to the Original Option in accordance with Code Section 424 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder so that the conversion (x) is treated as the issuance or assumption of a stock option under Code Section 424(a) and (y) is not treated as a modification, extension or renewal of a stock option under Code Section 424(h).
8.0 SARS
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant SARs to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors. An SAR is a right to receive a payment in cash, Common Stock or a combination of both, in an amount equal to the excess of (x) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, or other specified valuation, of a specified number of shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is exercised over (y) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock, or other specified valuation (which shall be no less than the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock), of such shares of Common Stock on the date the SAR is granted, all as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that if a SAR is granted retroactively in tandem with or in substitution for a Stock Option, the designated Fair Market Value of the Common Stock in the Award Agreement may be the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date such Stock Option was granted. Each SAR shall be subject to such terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, a provision that automatically converts a SAR into a Stock Option on a conversion date specified at the time of grant, as the Committee shall impose from time to time in its sole discretion and subject to the terms of the Plan.

The Committee may require the Participant to deliver a duly signed stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Common Stock covered by such Stock Award and/or that the stock certificates evidencing such shares be held in custody or bear restrictive legends until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed.

Subject to a Participant's election to defer in accordance with Section 17.3 below, upon the Vesting of a Stock Unit, the shares of Common Stock representing the Stock Unit shall be distributed to the Participant, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides for the payment of the Stock Unit in cash (or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common Stock) equal to the value of the shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be distributed to the Participant.

A Performance Unit is a hypothetical share or shares of Common Stock represented by a notional account which shall be established and maintained (or caused to be established or maintained) by the Company for such Participant who receives a grant of Performance Units. Performance Units shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate including, without limitation, determining the performance goal or goals which, depending on the extent to which such goals are met, will determine the number and/or value of the Performance Units that will be accrued with respect to the Participant who has been granted Performance Units. Performance goals may be based on, without limitation, Company-wide, divisional and/or individual performance, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine, and may be based on the performance measures listed in Section 12.3 below.
10.2 PERFORMANCE UNITS.
With respect to those Performance Shares or Performance Units that are not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Awards (as described in Section 12 below), the Committee shall have the authority at any time to make adjustments to performance goals for any outstanding Performance Shares or Performance Units which the Committee deems necessary or desirable unless at the time of establishment of the performance goals the Committee shall have precluded its authority to make such adjustments.
10.3 ADJUSTMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS.
Subject to a Participant's election to defer in accordance with Section 17.3 below, upon the Vesting of a Performance Share or a Performance Unit, the shares of Common Stock representing the Performance Share or the Performance Unit shall be distributed to the Participant, unless the Committee, in its sole discretion, provides for the payment of the Performance Share or a Performance Unit in cash (or partly in cash and partly in shares of Common Stock) equal to the value of the shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be distributed to the Participant.
10.4 PAYOUT OF PERFORMANCE SHARES OR PERFORMANCE UNITS.
11.0 CASH AWARDS
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Cash Awards to Employees, Nonemployee Directors, and/or Independent Contractors as additional compensation or in lieu of other compensation for services to the Company. A Cash Award shall be subject to such terms and conditions as
11.1 IN GENERAL.
the Committee, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate including, without limitation, determining the Vesting Date with respect to such Cash Award, the criteria for the Vesting of such Cash Award, and the right of the Company to require the Participant to repay the Cash Award (with or without interest) upon termination of the Participant's employment within specified periods.
12.0 PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may designate Awards granted under the Plan as Performance-Based Awards (as defined below) if it determines that such compensation might not be tax deductible by the Company due to the deduction limitation imposed by Code Section 162(m). Accordingly, an Award granted under the Plan may be granted in such a manner that the compensation attributable to such Award is intended by the Committee to qualify as "performance-based compensation" (as such term is used in Code Section 162(m) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder) and thus be exempt from the deduction limitation imposed by Code Section 162(m) ("Performance-Based Awards").
12.1 IN GENERAL.
Awards shall only qualify as Performance-Based Awards under the Plan if:
12.2 QUALIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.
at the time of grant the Committee is comprised solely of two or more "outside directors" (as such term is used in Code Section 162(m) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder);
(a)
with respect to either the granting or Vesting of an Award (other than (i) a Nonqualified Stock Option or (ii) an SAR, which are granted with an exercise price at or above the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant), such Award is subject to the achievement of a performance goal or goals based on one or more of the performance measures specified in Section 12.3 below;
(b)
the Committee establishes in writing (i) the objective performance-based goals applicable to a given performance period and (ii) the individual employees or class of employees to which such performance-based goals apply no later than 90 days after the commencement of such performance period (but in no event after 25 percent of such performance period has elapsed);
(c) 
no compensation attributable to a Performance-Based Award will be paid to or otherwise received by a Participant until the Committee certifies in writing that the performance goal or goals (and any other material terms) applicable to such performance period have been satisfied;
(d)
after the establishment of a performance goal, the Committee shall not revise such performance goal (unless such revision will not disqualify compensation attributable to the Award as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m)) or increase the amount of compensation payable with respect to such Award upon the attainment of such performance goal; and
(e)
no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of such performance goals may be waived with respect to Performance-Based Awards, except in the event of a Change in Control or certain involuntary terminations of employment or service prior to the completion of the performance period.
(f)
The Committee may use the following performance measures (either individually or in any combination) to set performance goals with respect to Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Awards: net sales; pretax income before allocation of corporate overhead and bonus; budget; cash flow; earnings per share; net income; division, group or corporate financial goals; return on stockholders' equity; return on assets; attainment of strategic and operational initiatives; appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the Common Stock or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; market share; gross profits; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense; economic value-added models; comparisons with various stock market indices; increase in number of customers; and/or reductions in costs. The performance measures may, at the time they are established for one or more such Performance-Based Awards, be subject to adjustment for one or more of the following items: extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain, loss or expense; items of gain, loss or expense related to (a) the disposal of a business or discontinued operations or (b) the operations of any business acquired by the Company; accruals for reorganization and restructuring cost and expenses; and items of gain, loss or expense attributable to changes in tax laws and regulations, accounting principles or other applicable laws or regulations.
12.3 PERFORMANCE MEASURES.
As required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(vi), the material terms of performance goals as described in this Section 12 shall be disclosed to and reapproved by the Company's stockholders no later than the first stockholder meeting that occurs in the 5th year following the year in which the Company's stockholders previously approved such performance goals.
12.4 STOCKHOLDER REAPPROVAL.
13.0 CHANGE IN CONTROL
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if there is a Change in Control of the Company, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may take such actions as it deems appropriate with respect to outstanding Awards, including, without limitation, accelerating the Vesting Date and/or payout of such Awards; provided, however, that such action shall not conflict with any provision contained in an Award Agreement unless such provision is amended in accordance with Section 16.3 below.
13.1 ACCELERATED VESTING.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the Company, all or a portion of certain outstanding Awards shall terminate within a specified number of days after notice to the holders, and each such holder shall receive an amount equal to the value of such Award on the date of the change in control, and with respect to each share of Common Stock subject to a Stock Option or SAR, an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of such shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the occurrence of such change in control over the exercise price per share of such Stock Option or SAR. Such amount shall be payable in cash, in one or more kinds of property (including the property, if any, payable in the transaction) or in a combination thereof, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
13.2 CASHOUT.
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that an Award may be assumed by any entity which acquires control of the Company or may be substituted by a similar award under such entity's compensation plans.
13.3 ASSUMPTION OR SUBSTITUTION OF AWARDS.
14.0 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IF PARTICIPANT IS AN EMPLOYEE
Subject to any written agreement between the Company and a Participant, if a Participant's employment is terminated due to death or Disability:
14.1 TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH OR DISABILITY.
all non-Vested portions of Awards held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death or the date of the termination of his or her employment, as the case may be, shall immediately be forfeited by such Participant as of such date; and
(a)
all Vested portions of Stock Options and SARs held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death or the date of the termination of his or her employment, as the case may be, shall remain exercisable until the earlier of:
(b)
the end of the 12-month period following the date of the Participant's death or the date of the termination of his or her employment, as the case may be, or
(i)
the date the Stock Option or SAR would otherwise expire.

Subject to any written agreement between the Company and a Participant, if a Participant's employment is terminated by the Company for cause, all Awards held by a Participant on the date of the termination of his or her employment for cause, whether Vested or non-Vested, shall immediately be forfeited by such Participant as of such date.

any or all Vested portions of Nonqualified Stock Options and/or SARs held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death and/or the date of the termination of his or her employment shall remain exercisable until a date that occurs on or prior to the date the Stock Option or SAR is scheduled to expire; and/or
(b)
any or all non-Vested portions of Stock Awards, Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Units, and/or Cash Awards held by the Participant on the date of the Participant's death and/or the date of the termination of his or her employment shall immediately Vest or shall become Vested on a date that occurs on or prior to the date the Award is scheduled to vest; provided, however, that the Committee shall not exercise such discretion with respect to any Performance-Based Award if and to the extent the provision for such accelerated vesting would otherwise disqualify the compensation attributable to that Award as "performance-based compensation" under Code Section 162(m).
(c)
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, (i) the provisions contained in this Section 14 shall be applied to an ISO only if the application of such provision maintains the treatment of such ISO as an ISO and (ii) the exercise period of an ISO in the event of a termination of the Participant's employment due to Disability provided in Section 14.1 above shall be applied only if the Participant is "permanently and totally disabled" (as such term is defined in Code Section 22(e)(3)).
14.5 ISOS.
15.0 TAXES
With respect to Employees, the Company, or the applicable Subsidiary, may require a Participant who has become vested in his or her Stock Award, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit granted hereunder, or who exercises a Stock Option or SAR granted hereunder to reimburse the corporation which employs such Participant for any taxes required by any governmental regulatory authority to be withheld or otherwise deducted and paid by such corporation or entity in respect of the issuance or disposition of such shares or the payment of any amounts. In lieu thereof, the corporation or entity which employs such Participant shall have the right to withhold the amount of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from such corporation or entity to the Participant upon such terms and conditions as the Committee shall prescribe. The corporation or entity that employs such Participant may, in its discretion, hold the stock certificate to which such Participant is entitled upon the vesting of a Stock Award, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit or the exercise of a Stock Option or SAR as security for the payment of such withholding tax liability, until cash sufficient to pay that liability has been accumulated.
15.1 WITHHOLDING TAXES.
With respect to Employees, at any time that the Company, Subsidiary or other entity that employs such Participant becomes subject to a withholding obligation under applicable law with respect to the vesting of a Stock Award, Stock Unit, Performance Share or Performance Unit or the exercise of a Nonqualified Stock Option (the "Tax Date"), except as set forth below, a holder of such Award may elect to satisfy, in whole or in part, the holder's related personal tax liabilities (an "Election") by (i) directing the Company, Subsidiary or other entity that employs such Participant to withhold from shares issuable in connection with such vesting or exercise either a specified number of shares or shares of Common Stock having a specified value (in each case limited to the related minimum statutory personal withholding tax liabilities with respect to the applicable taxing jurisdiction so as to preclude any "liability" accounting treatment for the Award pursuant to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), (ii) tendering shares of

An Election shall be irrevocable. The withheld shares and other shares of Common Stock tendered in payment shall be valued at their Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Tax Date. The Committee may disapprove of any Election, suspend or terminate the right to make Elections or provide that the right to make Elections shall not apply to particular shares or exercises. The Committee may impose any additional conditions or restrictions on the right to make an Election as it shall deem appropriate, including conditions or restrictions with respect to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
No person connected with the Plan in any capacity, including, but not limited to, the Company and any Subsidiary and their directors, officers, agents and employees makes any representation, commitment, or guarantee that any tax treatment, including, but not limited to, federal, state and local income, estate and gift tax treatment, will be applicable with respect to amounts deferred under the Plan, or paid to or for the benefit of a Participant under the Plan, or that such tax treatment will apply to or be available to a Participant on account of participation in the Plan.

(d)
In addition, the Plan shall not be amended without the approval of such amendment by the Company's stockholders if such amendment is (i) required under the rules and regulations of the stock exchange or national market system on which the Common Stock is listed or (ii) otherwise considered material in the reasonable judgment of the Committee.
The Committee may amend or modify any Award Agreement at any time by mutual agreement between the Committee and the Participant or such other persons as may then have an interest therein.

16.3 AMENDMENT OR CANCELLATION OF AWARD AGREEMENTS.
17.0 MISCELLANEOUS
Awards granted under the Plan may also be subject to such other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Award granted to any other Participant) as the Committee determines on the date of grant to be appropriate, including, without limitation, for the installment purchase of Common Stock under Stock Options, to assist the Participant in financing the acquisition of Common Stock, for the forfeiture of, or restrictions on resale or other disposition of, Common Stock acquired under
17.1 OTHER PROVISIONS.
any Stock Option, for the acceleration of Vesting of Awards in the event of a change in control of the Company, for the payment of the value of Awards to Participants in the event of a change in control of the Company, or to comply with federal and state securities laws, or understandings or conditions as to the Participant's employment in addition to those specifically provided for under the Plan.
Each Award granted under the Plan to a Participant shall not be transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and Stock Options and SARs shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant. In the event of the death of a Participant, each Stock Option or SAR theretofore granted to him or her shall be exercisable during such period after his or her death as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, set forth in the Award Agreement on the date of grant and then only by the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased Participant or the person or persons to whom the deceased Participant's rights under the Stock Option or SAR shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit the transferability of a Stock Option (other than an ISO) by a Participant solely to members of the Participant's immediate family or trusts or family partnerships or other similar entities for the benefit of such persons, and subject to such terms, conditions, restrictions and/or limitations, if any, as the Committee may establish and include in the Award Agreement.
17.2 TRANSFERABILITY.
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, allow a Participant to elect to defer the receipt of any compensation attributable to an Award under guidelines and procedures to be established by the Committee after taking into account the advice of the Company's tax counsel.
17.3 ELECTION TO DEFER COMPENSATION ATTRIBUTABLE TO AWARD.
If at any time the Committee shall determine that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares of Common Stock subject to any Award on any securities exchange or under any applicable law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory authority, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of an Award or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder, such Award may not be exercised, distributed or paid out, as the case may be, in whole or in part, unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
17.4 LISTING OF SHARES AND RELATED MATTERS.
Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments which the Company may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan. The Plan is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
17.5 NO RIGHT, TITLE, OR INTEREST IN COMPANY ASSETS.
The Participant's rights, if any, to continue to serve the Company as a director, officer, employee, independent contractor or otherwise, shall not be enlarged or otherwise affected by his or her designation as a Participant under the Plan, and the Company or the applicable Subsidiary reserves the right to terminate the employment of any Employee or the services of any Independent Contractor or director at any time. The adoption of the Plan shall not be deemed to give any Employee, Nonemployee Director, Independent Contractor or any other individual any right to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award.
17.6 NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE OR TO GRANTS.
The Committee may grant Awards to individual Participants who are subject to the tax laws of nations other than the United States, and such Awards may have terms and conditions as determined by the Committee as necessary to comply with applicable foreign laws. The Committee may take any action which it deems advisable to obtain approval of such Awards by the appropriate foreign governmental entity; provided, however, that no such Awards may be granted pursuant to this Section 16.6 and no action may be taken which would result in a violation of the Exchange Act or any other applicable law.
17.7 AWARDS SUBJECT TO FOREIGN LAWS.
The Plan, all Awards granted hereunder, and all actions taken in connection herewith shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws, except as superseded by applicable federal law.
17.8 GOVERNING LAW.
No Award granted under the Plan shall be considered compensation for purposes of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company or any Subsidiary nor affect any benefits or compensation under any other benefit or compensation plan of the Company or any Subsidiary now or subsequently in effect.
17.9 OTHER BENEFITS.
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, Common Stock, Stock Options, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.
17.10 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may not, without the consent of the Company's stockholders, reprice any outstanding Award; provided, however, that stock splits, stock dividends and similar events as set forth in Section 5.2 herein shall not be deemed to be a repricing hereunder.
17.11 PROHIBITION ON REPRICING OF OPTIONS.
Except as set forth in Section 14 herein and notwithstanding any other provision set forth in the Plan to the contrary, (a) any Award (other than a Stock Option or SAR) that is not subject to performance criteria shall Vest over a service period of at least three years, with such vesting to occur in equal installments over such three year period, and (b) any Award (other than a Stock Option or SAR) that is subject to performance criteria shall Vest over a performance period of at least 12 months in one or more installments over that period.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
At a meeting on July 18, 2007, the Board of Directors approved the recommendations of the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company") and took the following actions with regard to the compensation of executive officers who were named in the 2006 Summary Compensation Table of the Company's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 27, 2007 (the "Named Executive Officers").
. The Compensation Committee considered the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers and determined to increase the base salaries for Francisco D'Souza, Gordon Coburn, Ramakrishnan Chandrasekaran and Rajeev Mehta effective January 1, 2007. There was no change made to the base salary of Lakshmi Narayanan. The table below sets forth the previous annual base salary levels and the new annual base salary levels for the Company's Named Executive Officers.
Base Salaries
 
. In addition, on July 18, 2007, the Compensation Committee addressed the applicable target percentages for the 2007 annual cash incentive bonuses for each of the Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee eliminated the cash incentive bonus for Lakshmi Narayanan. Each of the target percentages for the other Named Executive Officers remained the same other than Mr. Mehta's whose target increased from 67% to 70%. The annual incentive target levels for the Named Executive Officers are based on a percentage of their salary. The Compensation Committee determines actual cash incentive bonuses after the end of the fiscal year based upon the Company's performance. The table below sets forth the applicable percentages for the Company's Named Executive Officers for 2007.
Bonus Targets
 
Severance and Noncompetition Agreement with Rajeev Mehta
On July 23, 2007, the Company entered into a Severance and Noncompetition Agreement (the "Agreement") with Rajeev Mehta, Chief Operating Officer, Global Client Services, of the Company. Pursuant to the Agreement and among other matters, Mr. Mehta has agreed not to engage in a competitive business in any capacity for one year following termination of employment and not to solicit any of the Company's employees to leave the Company during the term of the Agreement and for the one-year period following termination of employment. The Agreement includes proprietary rights, assignment and confidentiality provisions. The Agreement also provides that Mr. Mehta will receive one year's base salary and a full annual bonus upon termination of employment, other than in the case of a termination for cause, as such term is defined in the Agreement. In addition, the Agreement provides that all stock options held by Mr. Mehta will vest in full immediately upon the occurrence of a change of control. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement filed herewith.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: July 24, 2007

Exhibit 10.1
In consideration of the employment of the undersigned ("Employee"), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, including any of its affiliates or direct or indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), and as a condition of continued Employment, Employee agrees as follows:
 
The Employee acknowledges that all Proprietary Information, as defined below, is the exclusive property of the Company or the party that disclosed or delivered the same to the Company. Specifically, Employee agrees that all Proprietary Information developed as a direct or indirect result of Employee's efforts during any period of employment with the Company shall be and shall remain the exclusive property of the Company, and the Employee shall have no ownership interest therein. To the extent Employee may have any interest in such developed Proprietary Information, Employee assigns such interest to the Company.
To the extent a copyright may be obtained in any Proprietary Information, (i) that copyright shall be considered the property of the Company, (ii) the Proprietary Information shall be "works made for hire" under the Copyright Act of 1976 (the "Copyright Act"), the copyright for those works shall be the sole property of the Company and the Company shall be the sole author of such works within the meaning of the Copyright Act, (iii) Employee hereby assigns to the Company any of his rights to any such copyrightable material and (iv) Employee expressly disclaims any and all interest he may have in the works. In the event that the copyright to any work may not be the property of the Company by operation of law, Employee irrevocably assigns to the Company all right, title and interest in the work, including all so-called "moral rights." If the moral rights cannot be assigned under the laws of a country where such rights exist, Employee hereby waives all of his moral rights and consents to any action of the Company that would violate such rights in the absence of such consent.
While employed by the Company and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, Employee shall not use or disclose any Proprietary Information, directly or indirectly, except as authorized by the Company in connection with Employee's assigned duties. The foregoing notwithstanding, Employee shall not at any time use or disclose, directly or indirectly, any of the Proprietary Information constituting Trade Secrets of the Company, as defined below, except as authorized by the Company in connection with Employee's assigned duties.
 
"Proprietary Information," as referred to herein, includes all of the following information and material, whether or not reduced to writing and whether or not patentable, that Employee during any period of employment with the Company has access to or develops in whole or in part as a direct or indirect result of such employment or through the use of any of the Company's facilities or resources:
(i) application, operating system, communication and other computer software, including, without limitation, all source and object code, flow charts, algorithms, coding sheets, routines, sub-routines, compilers, assemblers, design concepts and related documentation and manuals;
(ii) production processes, marketing techniques, purchasing information, fee lists, licensing policies, quoting procedures, financial information, employee names and job descriptions, customer and prospective customer names and requirements, data and other information or material relating to the manner in which any customer, prospective customer or the Company does business;
(iii) discoveries, concepts and ideas (including, but not limited to, the nature and results of research and development activities), processes, formulae, techniques, "know-how," designs, drawings and specifications;
(iv) any other information or material relating to the business or activities of the Company which is not generally known to others engaged in similar businesses or activities;
(v) all inventions and ideas which are derived from or relate to Employee's access to or knowledge of any of the information or material described herein; and
(vi) any of the information or material described herein which is the property of any other person or firm which has revealed or delivered such information or material to the Company pursuant to a contractual relationship with the Company or otherwise in the course of the Company's business.
"Proprietary Information" shall not include any information or material of the type described herein to the extent that such information or material is or becomes publicly known through no act on Employee's part. "Trade Secrets," as referred herein, include all of the information and material described in paragraphs (i), (iii), (v) and (vi) above. The failure to mark any of the Proprietary Information as confidential shall not affect its status as Proprietary Information or Trade Secrets.
 
All notes, data, reference material, sketches, drawings, memoranda and records in any way relating to any of the Proprietary Information or to the Company's business shall belong exclusively to the Company, and at the request of the Company or, absent such a request, upon the termination of Employee's employment with the Company, Employee agrees to turn over to the Company all such materials and copies thereof in Employee's possession.
 
Employee understands and agrees that the Company shall suffer irreparable harm if Employee breaches any of Employee's obligations under this Agreement and that monetary damages shall be inadequate to compensate the Company for any breach hereof. Accordingly, Employee agrees that, in addition to any other remedies or rights, the Company shall have the right to obtain an injunction to enforce the terms of this Agreement.
Employee represents that Employee's performance as an employee of the Company will not breach any employment agreement nor any agreement to keep in confidence any trade secret or confidential or proprietary information of a former employer. Employee has not brought any trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information of a former employer to the Company. Employee will not disclose nor use in the performance of Employee's work with the Company any trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information without authorization from the former employer.
 
Until one (1) year after the termination of Employee's employment with the Company, Employee will not solicit or otherwise encourage others to leave the Company's employment.
 
Employee recognizes and acknowledges that his services to the Company are of importance to its continued economic success and growth.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Teaneck, NJ  August 1, 2007  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of global IT and business process outsourcing services, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007.
Highlights  Second Quarter 2007
 
 
 
Revenue for the second quarter increased to $516.5 million, up 12% from $460.3 million in the first quarter of 2007, and up 53% from $336.8 million in the second quarter of 2006. GAAP net income was $82.3 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $55.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.6%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $9.5 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.4%, in-line with the Company's targeted 19 to 20% range. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are very pleased with our strong second quarter financial results, which further extend our track record of industry-leading growth," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "During the quarter, we surpassed the $2 billion annual revenue run rate, achieving this milestone just six quarters after surpassing a $1 billion annual revenue rate in the fourth quarter of 2005. Our rapid achievement of this milestone is a clear testament to the success of our long-term strategy of reinvesting in our business to meet the unique needs of our clients and drive value for our shareholders. Our operating margin for the quarter was within our target range and reflects our ability to effectively manage our business to offset macroeconomic headwinds, such as the recent appreciation of the Indian Rupee, while continuing to expand our proven growth platform around the world."
D'Souza continued, "Cognizant's second quarter performance was driven by growth across all dimensions of our business: vertical industry segments, service-areas and geographies. We increased our strategic customers by five, including two in Europe, where revenue grew 79% year-over-year and continues to outpace the Company average. Revenue from our Financial Services business segment, which includes banking, financial services and insurance customers, grew over 13% sequentially, and we experienced strong growth during the quarter from our telecommunications and healthcare customers. Demand across our broad range of solutions continued to rise, especially in ERP, Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence, Testing, and Infrastructure Management. Moving forward, we believe that the steadfast execution of our strategy and our commitment to expanding our global platform will continue to translate into strong financial and operating results."
2007 Outlook  Third Quarter & Full Year
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"Our second quarter results clearly reflect our ability to effectively maintain our operating targets while continuing to reinvest in the growth of the business," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "In order to support our future growth, Cognizant's Board of Directors has approved plans to make an additional $100 million investment in our previously announced infrastructure expansion program across India. The expanded construction plan at our new Chennai campus, located in a Special Economic Zone ("SEZ"), has now doubled in size with over two million square feet of capacity currently under construction. We have also increased the size of the first phase of planned construction of our SEZ facility in Coimbatore to over 725,000 square feet, and are acquiring additional property in Hyderabad and Chennai. We expect this investment to enhance our flexibility to meet the escalating demand for our services from both new and existing customers around the world. As a result of the strong demand environment, we are raising our guidance for full year 2007."

This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes a cost, namely, stock-based compensation, that is recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in
accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes a cost, namely, stock-based compensation, that is recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
On December 6, 2007, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate and Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company"), the Board appointed John Fox to the Board as a Class III Director to fill an existing vacancy. Mr. Fox will serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held in 2009.
Mr. Fox, age 65, formerly served as Vice Chairman of Deloitte & Touche LLP and Global Director, Strategic Clients for Deloitte Consulting, from 1998 until 2003. Mr. Fox held various other positions with Deloitte Consulting from 1968 to 2003, and in addition to his responsibilities as Vice Chairman and Global Director, he also served on Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's board of directors and was a member of the Governance (Executive) Committee from 1998 to 2003. Mr. Fox currently serves as a Trustee for Wabash College and Steppenwolf Theatre Company and is a member of the board of directors of VASCO Data Security International, Inc. as well as various non-profit entities. Mr. Fox received his B.A. degree from Wabash College and his MBA from the University of Michigan.
The Board determined that Mr. Fox has no relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, that would be inconsistent with a determination of independence under the applicable rules and regulations of NASDAQ or the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither Mr. Fox nor any member of his immediate family has engaged, directly or indirectly, in any transaction, or series of similar transactions, with the Company or any of its subsidiaries since January 1, 2006 in which the amount involved exceeds $60,000. In addition, Mr. Fox does not have any family relationship with any executive officer or director of the Company.
Mr. Fox shall receive compensation for serving on the Board pursuant to the Board compensation plan that was previously disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC. Pursuant to such compensation plan, on December 6, 2007 (the "Grant Date"), the Company granted Mr. Fox nonqualified stock options to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), pursuant to the grant provisions of the Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended and restated through the date of grant) (the "1999 Plan"), at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying Common Stock on the Grant Date. Fifty percent (50%) of such options will vest one (1) year from the Grant Date, and the remaining fifty percent (50%) of such options will vest two (2) years from the Grant Date. Such option grant has a term of 10 years.
On December 6, 2007, the Company issued a press release announcing the appointment of Mr. Fox to serve as a director of the Company. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Awards of Performance Unit Grants to Certain Named Executives
On December 6, 2007, the independent members of the Board, after thorough evaluation, granted the following awards of Performance Units to certain named executive officers of the Company set forth below pursuant to the 1999 Plan. The independent members of the Board believe that the following equity awards are competitive with the Company's peer group, improve employee retention and align the goals of management with those of the Company's stockholders. The shares of Common Stock under the Performance Units vest upon the achievement of certain performance milestones set forth below.
 
Such equity awards were granted pursuant to the Company's 1999 Plan. The foregoing table sets forth the number of shares of Common Stock under the Performance Units that will vest if (i) the Committee (as such term is defined in the 1999 Plan) determines that the annual net sales growth for the calendar year ending coincident with the relevant measurement date meets or exceeds the applicable targets for such year and (ii) the participant remains employed by or continues to serve the Company, or any subsidiary thereof, as an employee, non-employee director, independent contractor or otherwise on December 31, 2010. The number of shares of Common Stock that will vest for performance between the applicable threshold targets will be determined using straight-line interpolation, rounded down to the preceding whole number. The number of shares underlying the Performance Units were calculated using the closing price of the Common Stock on December 5, 2007, equal to $31.78 per share.
 
Increase to Stock Repurchase Program
On December 6, 2007, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $100 million increase in the aggregate value of shares that the Company may repurchase pursuant to its previously implemented $100 million stock repurchase program. Repurchases under the program may continue to be made through open market purchases or private transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18. The timing of any repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by the Company's management, in its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The Company anticipates that the $100 million increase in the stock repurchase program will be funded using its cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: December 6, 2007

Exhibit 10.1
Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), grants this Award of Performance Units to the Participant named below, pursuant to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") and this Performance Unit Award Agreement (this "Agreement").

The payment of any award, shares of Common Stock, benefits, or dividend equivalents hereunder is expressly conditioned upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan and your compliance with such terms and conditions.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Teaneck, NJ  February 7, 2008  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT and business process outsourcing services, today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2007. All share and per share amounts for the prior year periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split, effective October 16, 2007.
Highlights  Fourth Quarter 2007
 
 
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to $600.0 million, up 7% sequentially from $558.8 million in the third quarter of 2007, and up 41% from $424.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. GAAP net income was $96.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $69.5 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.36. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.7%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $9.8 million and a $5.9 million non-cash operating expense charge resulting from the nine-month impact of the recently enacted and clarified fringe benefit tax on the exercise of stock options in India, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3%, above the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial performance, which was driven by strong growth across our business segments, service offerings and geographic regions," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Our results reflect Cognizant's ability to translate our investments in our global platform into new growth opportunities for the Company. Our leadership positions in key industry verticals resulted in strong revenue performance in our Healthcare and Financial Services business segments. We were also pleased to have closed the acquisition of marketRx during the quarter, which we anticipate will enable Cognizant to further enhance our strong market position in data analytics and the Life Sciences industry. Once again, I am pleased with our performance in Europe, where revenue grew 89%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2006."
Mr. D'Souza continued: "Looking forward, we remain focused on maintaining our industry-leading growth while continuing to improve efficiencies in our business and leveraging the scale of our operations through higher utilization. We intend to continue building distinctive positions in each vertical and horizontal service area, as well as expand our geographic footprint. In addition to building the infrastructure, processes and intellectual capital to allow us to scale the business, we remain committed to ensuring we have an environment at Cognizant where the best talent in the world can thrive. We are confident that our wide range of services, geographic footprint and strong pool of talent position us effectively to adapt to the changing economic environment, as we continue to capitalize on opportunities for the long-term growth of the business."
Highlights  Full Year 2007
 
 
 
Revenue for 2007 increased to $2.136 billion, up 50% from $1.424 billion for 2006. GAAP net income was $350.1 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared to $232.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for 2006. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.27. GAAP operating margin was 17.9%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $35.9 million and a $5.9 million non-cash operating expense charge resulting from the recently enacted fringe benefit tax on the exercise of stock options in India, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
2008 Outlook  First Quarter & Full Year
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
"Our fourth quarter results are a testament to our ability to successfully manage our business while investing in Cognizant's growth platform around the world," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "Throughout 2007, we continued to build our infrastructure to capture economies of scale and position Cognizant for long-term revenue growth. We generated approximately $150 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter. After the acquisition of marketRx and buying back approximately 3.39 million shares of Cognizant stock for $105.4 million, we ended the year with over $670 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet, leaving us with the financial flexibility to invest in our people, services and infrastructure to further differentiate Cognizant in the marketplace. Based on the demand environment and the strength of our growth platform, we believe that Cognizant will continue to outpace our overall market in 2008 and deliver value to our shareholders."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation and the related stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

On April 18, 2008, the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), approved an amendment to Article I, Section 7 of the Company's Amended and Restated By-laws to change the vote standard for the election of directors from plurality to a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. In contested elections the vote standard will continue to be a plurality of votes cast. In addition, the Board approved an amendment to Article I, Section 9(A)(2) of the Amended and Restated By-laws to provide that director nominees proposed by stockholders must deliver a statement that, if elected, they agree to tender an irrevocable resignation, in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines that are applicable to all director nominees, upon failure to receive the required vote in a subsequent election.

SECTION 1. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be held on the third Wednesday in April of each year, if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next secular day following, within or without the State of Delaware, or at such time and place as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 2. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special meetings of stockholders of the corporation may be called only by the Chief Executive Officer of the corporation or by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution approved by the Board of Directors, and special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice.
SECTION 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of the time, place and purpose or purposes of every meeting of stockholders shall be given not earlier than sixty, nor less than ten, days previous thereto to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Notice of any meeting of stockholders need not be given to any stockholders who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing or by electronic transmission, or to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
SECTION 4. The holders of record of a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of the corporation, which are entitled to vote at the meeting, shall, except as otherwise provided by law, constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders. If there be no such quorum present in person or by proxy, the holders of a majority in voting power of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time.
SECTION 5. (1) Meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, or, if neither is present, by a Vice President or, if no such officer is present, by a chairman to be chosen at the meeting. The Secretary of the corporation or, in his absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman shall appoint a secretary.
(2) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
SECTION 6. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting may vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question at the time; but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.
SECTION 7. At all elections of directors the voting shall be by ballot, and a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article I, Section 9(A)(2) of these By-laws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the day next preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation, or applicable law, all other questions to stockholders shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast on such questions.
 
SECTION 8. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten (10) days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 9. (A) Annual Meetings of Stockholders. (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 9 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 9, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the
 
corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address of each nominee proposed in such notice, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of each such nominee, (iii) the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are beneficially owned by each such nominee, (iv) a statement whether each such nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's failure to receive the required vote for election or re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face election or reelection, an irrevocable resignation effective upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, (v) such other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (vi) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws of the corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (iv) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least
 
the percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
B. Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (2) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 9 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
 
C. General. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(iv) of this Section 9) and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 9, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.
(2) For purposes of this Section 9, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9. Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors of the corporation shall consist of such number of directors, not less than three, as shall from time to time be fixed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. A majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Directors need not be stockholders.
SECTION 2. Vacancies in the Board of Directors and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall be filled as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.
SECTION 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of call of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, by oral, telegraphic, facsimile or written notice or notice by means of electronic transmission, duly served on or sent, given or mailed to each director not less than one day before the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after the meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting in person or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing or by electronic transmission. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings (or electronic transmission or transmissions) are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.
SECTION 4. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation, which to the extent permitted by law and provided in said resolution or resolutions, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of its business. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors, to act at the meeting for all purposes in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
 
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors as soon as may be after their election held in each year shall elect officers of the corporation, including a Chief Executive Officer, one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The Board of Directors may also from time to time appoint such other officers (including a Chairman who shall be a member of the Board of Directors, one or more Vice Chairmen, one or more Assistant Secretaries and one or more Assistant Treasurers) as it may deem proper or may delegate to any elected officer of the corporation the power so to appoint and remove any such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive, Senior, or Regional, or may be given such other designation or combination of designations.
SECTION 2. All officers of the corporation elected or appointed by the Board of Directors shall hold office until their respective successors are chosen and qualified. Any officer may be removed from office at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, or, in the case of appointed officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have been conferred by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3. Each of the officers of the corporation elected or appointed by the Board of Directors shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law, by the By-laws or by the Board of Directors and, unless otherwise prescribed by the By-laws or by the Board of Directors, shall have such further powers and duties as ordinarily pertain to his office. The Chief Executive Officer shall be the Principal Executive Officer and shall have the general direction of the affairs of the corporation. Any officer, agent, or employee of the corporation may be required to give bond for the faithful discharge of his duties in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe.
SECTION 4. The corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person (a "Covered Person") made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as specifically provided in this paragraph below, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The corporation shall to the fullest extend not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in
 
advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article III or otherwise. The corporation may indemnify, to the full extent permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article III is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. The indemnification provided by this Article III shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person indemnified may be entitled under by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be such director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article III or otherwise.
SECTION 1. Except as otherwise determined by resolution of the Board of Directors in respect of any uncertificated shares, the interest of each stockholder of the corporation shall be evidenced by a certificate or certificates for shares of stock in such form as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe. Subject to any applicable restrictions on transfer, the shares of the stock of the corporation shall be transferable on the books of the corporation by the holder thereof in person or by his attorney, upon surrender for cancellation of a certificate or certificates for the same number of shares, with an assignment and power of transfer endorsed thereon or attached thereto, duly executed, and with such proof of the authenticity of the signature as the corporation or its agents may reasonably require.
 
SECTION 2. The certificates of stock shall be signed by such officer or officers as may be permitted by law to sign (except that where any such certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent other than the corporation or its employee, or by a registrar other than the corporation or its employee, the signatures of any such officer or officers may be facsimiles), and shall be countersigned and registered in such manner, all as the Board of Directors may by resolution prescribe. In case any officer or officers who shall have signed, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used on any such certificate or certificates shall cease to be such officer or officers of the corporation, whether because of death, resignation or otherwise, before such certificate or certificates shall have been issued by the corporation, such certificate or certificates may nevertheless be issued and delivered as though the person or persons who signed such certificate or certificates, or whose facsimile signature or signatures shall have been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer or officers of the corporation.
SECTION 3. No certificate for shares of stock in the corporation shall be issued in place of any certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, except upon production of such evidence of such loss, theft or destruction and upon delivery to the corporation of a bond of indemnity in such amount, upon such terms and secured by such surety, as the Board of Directors in its discretion may require.
The books of the corporation may be kept outside of the State of Delaware at such place or places as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.
All checks and drafts on the corporation's bank accounts and all bills of exchange and promissory notes, and all acceptances, obligations and other instruments for the payment of money, shall be signed by such officer or officers or agent or agents as shall be thereunto authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors. Proxies to vote and consents with respect to securities of other corporations or entities owned by or standing in the name of the corporation may be executed and delivered from time to time on behalf of the corporation by the Chief Executive Officer, or by such officers as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine.
The fiscal year of the corporation shall begin on the first day of January in each year and shall end on the thirty-first day of December following.
 
The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the corporation and the words "Corporate Seal" state and date of incorporation. In lieu of the corporate seal, when so authorized by the Board of Directors or a duly empowered committee thereof, a facsimile thereof may be impressed or affixed or reproduced.
The corporation and the stockholders and the directors may have offices outside of the State of Delaware at such places as shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors shall be authorized to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal the By-laws of the corporation in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Delaware. The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent in voting power of all the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required in order for the stockholders to make, amend, alter, change, add to or repeal any provision of the By-laws of the corporation.

Highlights  First Quarter 2008
 
 
 
Revenue for the first quarter increased to $643.1 million, up 7.2% from $600.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, and up 40% from $460.3 million in the first quarter of 2007. GAAP net income was $101.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $75.4 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.4%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $13.0 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5%, in line with the Company's targeted 19 to 20% range. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are pleased with this quarter, during which we have surpassed our growth targets. The quarter's results, achieved despite the increased economic uncertainty and challenges in the financial services industry, testify to the resilience of our business model which is diversified across business segments, service offerings and geographic regions," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Our Healthcare, Retail/Manufacturing/Logistics and Other segments all demonstrated sequential growth of approximately 10% or greater and Europe continued to grow well in excess of company average, growing 12% sequentially during the quarter."
Mr. D'Souza continued, "We have adopted a more cautious view for the remainder of the year to reflect the heightened economic challenges over the past two months. However, we believe that the current environment also presents us with opportunities to help clients in industries such as financial services, healthcare and media adapt to the structural changes that are transforming their industries. In addition, our clients are also seeking cost rationalization solutions in order to compensate for the pressures on their businesses. The investments we've made in broadening our service offerings, building deep domain expertise and advanced consulting and analytics capabilities position us well to capitalize on these needs."
2008 Outlook  Second Quarter & Full Year
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
"We continue to invest across our industries, service-areas and geographies in order to address client needs, enhance our market position, continue to grow and deliver value for shareholders," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "While keeping these goals in mind, we plan to increase resource utilization throughout 2008 in order to optimize efficiency and quality and help us remain flexible within the current environment. As we look ahead, we remain confident that despite near-term challenges in the economy, our strategy and execution excellence will ensure that Cognizant's growth continues to outpace the industry."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based
compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation and the related stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The full text of the press release is attached to this current report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.*

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Teaneck, NJ  July 31, 2008  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT and business process outsourcing services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Highlights  Second Quarter 2008
 
 
 
Revenue for the quarter increased to $685.4 million, up 6.6% sequentially from $643.1 million in the first quarter of 2008, and up 33% from $516.5 million in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP net income was $103.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $82.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2007. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 17.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $10.5 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.8%, in line with the Company's targeted 19 to 20% range. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"Despite continued uncertainty in the marketplace, we exceeded our quarterly revenue guidance and our sequential growth once again outpaced our peer group in the second quarter," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Several of our business segments, including Financial Services, performed well during the quarter. Furthermore, we generated continued strong performance across Europe and healthy growth from our Business/Knowledge Process Outsourcing and IT Infrastructure Services practices as a result of clients' focusing on cost efficiencies."
"Due to the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and sagging consumer and business confidence, we are adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year. However, we remain optimistic about our long-term growth prospects given that our pipeline of large deals remains healthy, our market position remains strong and the trend towards increasing offshore spending continues, driven by secular changes in industry dynamics, pressures to find cost efficiencies or, in some cases, both."
2008 Outlook  Third Quarter & Full Year
Based on current visibility, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
"Although we are disappointed with the necessity of reducing our outlook for the second half of the year due to the weakening economy, we are pleased to continue our expectation of industry leading growth and a healthy long-term outlook for the business," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "We continue to invest across the markets we serve, deepening our consulting and domain capabilities and expanding our services offerings in areas such as Business/Knowledge Process Outsourcing and IT Infrastructure Services in order to extend our leading competitive position. At the same time, we are focused on managing our expenses and increasing utilization in order to optimize our operating performance while we invest for the long term success of the business."

Teaneck, NJ  November 5, 2008  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of IT and business process outsourcing services, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.

"During one of the most volatile and disruptive periods for the global economy in recent memory Cognizant's overall performance in the third quarter, including our industry-leading revenue growth and excellent operating margin, clearly demonstrates the strength of our business model," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "The quarter further validates our long-term strategy of reinvesting in the business and strengthening our domain and technical expertise."
"Through this period of economic uncertainty, we are working with clients across all sectors, including banking and financial services, to help with the twin challenges of simultaneously driving further cost savings while investing to capture new growth opportunities. We believe that this positions us well to navigate through this period of economic turbulence as well as for long-term growth once the economy improves."
"We are increasingly engaging as a trusted partner to our clients at the senior executive levels because our ability to bring cost saving and higher productivity is so important to their enterprise value. In coming quarters, we expect to use our agility and broad range of services to become more instrumental in helping clients navigate these turbulent economic times and emerge as even stronger businesses."
2008 Outlook  Fourth Quarter & Full Year
The Company has maintained the full year revenue guidance it provided last quarter:
 
 
 
 
 
"During this economic downturn we are continuing to focus on operational excellence and increased utilization while re-investing in the business in order to deepen our sector and domain skills, broaden our offerings and strengthen our consultancy expertise, thus ensuring we are the preferred partner for our clients," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "Despite our stronger-than-expected third quarter revenue performance, we are maintaining our full year guidance in light of the current environment which requires caution and prudence. We remain confident in our long-term strategy, and we will continue to focus on investment in the business and operational excellence to ensure we drive industry leading results over the long-term."

Amendments to Severance and Noncompetition Agreements with Named Executive Officers
On December 3, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company") approved a form of amendment (the "Amendment") to the Severance and Noncompetition Agreements that it had previously entered into with the executive officers who were named in the 2007 Summary Compensation Table of the Company's Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 28, 2008 (the "Named Executive Officers"). Each Severance and Noncompetition Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the Named Executive Officer's obligations to the Company and the Company's obligations to the Named Executive Officer in the event of termination of the Named Executive Officer's employment. The Amendment modifies the Severance and Noncompetition Agreements to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"). The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Amendment to the Severance and Noncompetition Agreements with the Named Executive Officers filed herewith.
Amendment to The Cognizant Technology Solutions Executive Pension Plan
On December 3, 2008, the Compensation Committee also approved an amendment to The Cognizant Technology Solutions Executive Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that was intended to serve as the economic equivalent of the retirement plan in which Gordon Coburn participated while the Company was majority owned by IMS Health. The Pension Plan was amended and restated, effective January 1, 2009, to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to The Cognizant Technology Solutions Executive Pension Plan filed herewith.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
On December 5, 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $50,000,000 of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock") over a period of time not to exceed 12 months. Repurchases under the program may be made through open market purchases or private transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18. The timing of any repurchases and the exact number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased will be determined by the Company's management, in its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The Company anticipates that the program will be funded using its cash on hand and cash generated from operations.

, the Company and Employee previously entered into that certain Severance and Non-Competition Agreement, dated , 200, (the ""), which sets forth the terms and conditions of Employee's obligations to the Company and the Company's obligations to Employee in the event of termination of Employee's employment;
WHEREAS
            
    
    
Severance Agreement
, the Company and Employee desire to amend the Severance Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the final regulations issued thereunder (the ""); and
WHEREAS
Code
Section 10 of the Severance Agreement provides that the Severance Agreement may be modified pursuant to a written agreement signed by Employee and the Company.
WHEREAS,
, the Company and Employee hereby agree that, effective , 2008, the Severance Agreement shall be amended as follows:
NOW, THEREFORE
            
    
1. The first paragraph of Section 8 of the Severance Agreement is hereby revised as follows:
"In the event that Employee's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause (as hereinafter defined), Employee shall be entitled to receive the following severance payments: (x) an amount equal to Employee's then-current annual base salary, which payments shall be paid in substantially equal installments for the one (1)-year period following the date of termination commencing on the payroll date next following the effective date of such termination without Cause and thereafter paid in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices; and (y) a bonus payment in an amount equal to the actual bonus which would have been earned for the year in which Employee experiences such termination without Cause (based on the level of achievement of the applicable performance criteria), which payment shall be made at the same time and in the same manner as bonuses are paid to other executives in accordance with the terms of the Company's bonus plan, as if Employee had remained employed by the Company for the remainder of the year in which Employee's termination of employment occurs."
2. A new Section 11 is hereby added to the Severance Agreement to read as follows:
"11. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code:
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), to the extent applicable, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to avoid any penalty sanctions under Section 409A of the Code. Accordingly, all provisions herein, or incorporated by reference, shall be construed and interpreted to comply with Section 409A of the Code and, if necessary, any such provision shall be deemed amended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. If any payment or benefit cannot be provided or made at the time specified herein without incurring sanctions under Section 409A of the Code, then such benefit or payment shall be provided in full at the earliest time thereafter when such sanctions will not be imposed. Severance benefits under this Agreement are intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code under the "separation pay exception," to the maximum extent applicable. Any payments that qualify for the "short-term deferral" exception or another exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable exception. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, all payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Agreement may only be made upon a "separation from service" (within the meaning of such term under Section 409A of the Code). Each payment made under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment and the right to a series of installment payments shall be treated as the right to a series of separate payments. In no event shall Employee, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if on the date of Employee's "separation from service," Employee is a "specified employee" (as such term is defined in section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code) as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (or its delegate) in its sole discretion in accordance with its "specified employee" determination policy, then all cash severance payments payable to Employee under this Agreement that are deemed as deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code shall be postponed for a period of six (6) months following Employee's "separation from service" with the Company (or any successor thereto). The postponed amounts shall be paid to Employee in a lump sum within thirty (30) days after the date that is six (6) months following Employee's "separation from service" with the Company (or any successor thereto) and any installments that are payable after such six (6)-month period shall be paid in accordance with their original schedule. If Employee dies during such six (6)-month period and prior to payment of the postponed cash amounts hereunder, the amounts delayed on account of Section 409A of the Code shall be paid to the personal representative of Employee's estate within sixty (60) days after Employee's death."
3. In all respects not modified by this Amendment 2008-1, the Severance Agreement is hereby ratified and confirmed.
 
, the Company and Employee agree to the terms of the foregoing Amendment 2008-1, effective as of the date set forth above.

(c) A Participant may direct that his or her Retirement Account and or In-Service Account(s) established pursuant to Section 5.1 may be valued as if they were invested in one or more Investment Funds up to a maximum of fifteen (15) funds in multiples of one percent (1%) of the balance in an Account. A Participant may change his or her selection of Investment Funds no more than six (6) times each Plan Year. An election shall be effective as soon as administratively feasible following the date of the change as indicated in writing by the Participant.
 
Each Participant shall designate on his or her initial election form the form and timing of his or her distribution by indicating the type of account as described under Section 5.1, and by designating the manner in which payments shall be made from the choices available under Section 6.2 hereof.
 
(a) Retirement Account payouts shall commence within ninety (90) days following the date of the Participant's Retirement and are payable in either a lump-sum payment or in substantially equal annual installments over a period of up to ten (10) years as elected by Participant on a form provided by the Administrator.
(b) In-Service Account payouts shall begin within ninety (90) days following the January 1 of the calendar year designated by the Participant, on a properly submitted election form, and are payable in either a lump-sum payment or substantially equal annual installments over a period of five (5) years as elected by Participant on a form a provided by the Administrator.
(c) The amount of the substantially equal payments described in subsections (a) and (b) above shall be determined by multiplying the Participant's Retirement or In-Service Account by a fraction, the denominator of which in the first year of payment equals the number of years over which benefits are to be paid, and the numerator of which is one (1). The amounts of the payments for each succeeding year shall be determined by multiplying the Participant's Retirement or In-Service Account as of the applicable anniversary of the payout by a fraction, the denominator of which equals the number of remaining years over which benefits are to be paid, and the numerator of which is one (1).
(d) If a Participant has an In-Service Account(s) at the time of his or her Retirement, said Account(s) shall be transferred to his or her Retirement Account and paid out according to subsection (a) above.
 
A Participant will be permitted to elect to change the form or timing of the distribution of the balance of his or her Account to the extent permitted and in accordance with the requirements of Section 409A(a)(4)(C) of the Code, including the requirement that (i) a redeferral election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after such election is filed with the Employer, (ii) an election to further defer a distribution (other than a distribution upon death, disability or an unforeseeable emergency) must result in the first distribution subject to the election being made at least five (5) years after the previously elected date of distribution, and (iii) any redeferral election affecting a distribution at a fixed date must be filed with the Employer at least twelve (12) months before the first scheduled payment under the previous fixed date distribution election.
(a) Upon the death of a Participant, all amounts credited to his or her Account(s) shall be paid in a lump sum, to his or her beneficiary or beneficiaries as determined under Article 7 hereof, within ninety (90) days following the date of death.
(b) Upon the Disability of a Participant, all amounts credited to his or her Account(s) shall be paid to the Participant in a lump-sum payment, within ninety (90) days following the date of Disability.
(c) Upon the termination of employment of a Participant prior to the attainment of age fifty-five (55), all amounts credited to his or her Account(s) shall be paid to the Participant in a lump-sum payment, within ninety (90) days following the date of termination of employment subject to Section 6.5 below.
 
(a) If any employee is a "Specified Employee," as defined in subsection (b) below, upon a termination of employment for any reason other than Disability or death, a distribution may not be made before the date which is six (6) months after the date of separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of death of the employee).
(b) The term "Specified Employee" means a "specified employee" as determined by the Board or its delegate as of the specified identification date for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. The determination of Specified Employee, including the number and identity of persons considered Specified Employee and the identification date, shall be made by the Board or its delegate each year in accordance with Section 416(i) of the Code, the "specified employee" requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, and subject to Section 6.5 above, if the balance of a Participant's Account at the time of a termination due to Retirement is $10,000 or less, then the Participant shall be paid his or her benefits within ninety (90) days following the date of termination due to Retirement.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, and subject to Section 6.5 above, if the balance of a Participant's In-Service subaccount at the time of a scheduled In-Service Account distribution is $10,000 or less, then the Participant shall be paid his or her benefits as a single lump sum.
The Administrator may permit an early distribution of part or all of any deferred amounts; provided, however, that such distribution shall be made only if the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the Participant has experienced an unforeseeable emergency. An unforeseeable emergency is defined as a severe financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant's spouse, or a dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code) of the Participant, loss of the Participant's property due to casualty or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. If an unforeseeable emergency is determined to exist, a distribution may not exceed the amounts necessary to satisfy such emergency plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship). The determination as to the amount reasonably necessary to satisfy the unforeseeable emergency shall be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, in accordance with the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(3).
 
Each Participant may from time to time designate one or more persons (who may be any one or more members of such person's family or other persons, administrators, trusts, foundations or other entities) as his or her beneficiary under the Plan. Such designation shall be made on a form prescribed by the Administrator. Each Participant may at any time and from time to time, change any previous beneficiary designation, without notice to or consent of any previously designated beneficiary, by amending his or her previous designation on a form prescribed by the Administrator. If the beneficiary does not survive the Participant (or is otherwise unavailable to receive payment) or if no beneficiary is validly designated, then the amounts payable under this Plan shall be paid to the Participant's estate. If more than one person is the beneficiary of a deceased Participant, each such person shall receive a pro rata share of any death benefit payable unless otherwise designated on the applicable form. If a beneficiary who is receiving benefits dies, all benefits that were payable to such beneficiary shall then be payable to the estate of that beneficiary.
 
(a) All Participants and beneficiaries shall have the obligation to keep the Administrator informed of their current address until such time as all benefits due have been paid.
(b) If a Participant or beneficiary cannot be located by the Administrator exercising due diligence, then, in its sole discretion, the Administrator may presume that the Participant or beneficiary is deceased for purposes of the Plan and all unpaid amounts (net of due diligence expenses) owed to the Participant or beneficiary shall be paid accordingly or, if a beneficiary cannot be so located, then such amounts may be forfeited. Any such presumption of death shall be final, conclusive and binding on all parties.
 
Should any investment be acquired in connection with the liabilities assumed under this Plan, it is expressly understood and agreed that the Participants and beneficiaries shall not have any right with respect to, or claim against, such assets nor shall any such purchase be construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Employer and the Participants, their beneficiaries or any other person. Any such assets shall be and remain a part of the general, unpledged, unrestricted assets of the Employer, subject to the claims of its general creditors. It is the express intention of the parties hereto that this arrangement shall be unfunded for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of the ERISA. Each Participant and beneficiary shall be required to look to the provisions of this Plan and to the Employer itself for enforcement of any and all benefits due under this Plan, and to the extent any such person acquires a right to receive payment under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Employer. The Employer or the Trust shall be designated the owner and beneficiary of any investment acquired in connection with its obligation under this Plan.
 
Notwithstanding Section 8.1, or any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Employer may deposit into the Trust any amounts it deems appropriate to pay the benefits under this Plan.
 
(a) The Trustee shall not be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made by it, as herein provided, nor for any loss to, or diminution of, the Trust assets, unless due to its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith.
(b) Such Trustee shall be indemnified and saved harmless by the Employer from and against all personal liability to which it may be subject by reason of any act done or omitted to be done in its official capacity as Trustee in good faith in the administration of the Plan and Trust, including all expenses reasonably incurred in its defense in the event the Employer fails to provide such defense upon the request of the
Trustee. The Trustee is relieved of all responsibility in connection with its duties hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law, short of breach of duty to the beneficiaries.
 
If a Participant, beneficiary or his or her representative is denied all or a portion of an expected Plan benefit for any reason and the Participant, beneficiary or his or her representative desires to dispute the decision of the Administrator, he or she must file a written notification of his or her claim with the Administrator.
 
Upon receipt of any written claim for benefits, the Administrator shall be notified and shall give due consideration to the claim presented. If any Participant or beneficiary claims to be entitled to benefits under the Plan and the Administrator determines that the claim should be denied in whole or in part, the Administrator shall, in writing, notify such claimant within ninety (90) days of receipt of the claim that the claim has been denied. The Administrator may extend the period of time for making a determination with respect to any claim for a period of up to ninety (90) days, provided that the Administrator determines that such an extension is necessary because of special circumstances and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial ninety (90) day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a decision. If the claim is denied to any extent by the Administrator, the Administrator shall furnish the claimant with a written notice setting forth:
(a) the specific reason or reasons for denial of the claim;
(b) a specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(c) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary;
(d) an explanation of the provisions of this Article; and
(e) a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review;.
 
A claimant who has a claim denied wholly or partially under Section 9.2 may appeal to the Administrator for reconsideration of that claim. A request for reconsideration under this Section must be filed by written notice within sixty (60) days after receipt by the claimant of the notice of denial under Section 9.2.
Upon receipt of an appeal the Administrator shall promptly take action to give due consideration to the appeal. Such consideration may include a hearing of the parties involved, if the Administrator feels such a hearing is necessary. In preparing for this appeal the claimant shall be given the right to review pertinent documents and the right to submit in writing a statement of issues and comments. After consideration of the merits of the appeal the Administrator shall issue a written decision which shall be binding on all parties. The decision shall specifically state its reasons and pertinent Plan provisions on which it relies and include a statement describing the claimant's right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The Administrator's decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after the appeal is filed, except that the Administrator may extend the period of time for making a determination with respect to any claim for a period of up to sixty (60) days, provided that the Administrator determines that such an extension is necessary because of special circumstances and notifies the claimant, prior to the expiration of the initial sixty (60) day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Plan expects to render a decision.
 
The Administrator may designate any other person of its choosing to make any determination otherwise required under this Article. Any person so designated shall have the same authority and discretion granted to the Administrator hereunder.
 
(a) The Administrator is expressly empowered to limit the amount of compensation that may be deferred; to deposit amounts into trust in accordance with Section 8.2 hereof; to interpret the Plan, and to determine all questions arising in the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan; to employ actuaries, accountants, counsel, and other persons it deems necessary in connection with the administration of the Plan; to request any information from the Employer it deems necessary to determine whether the Employer would be considered insolvent or subject to a proceeding in bankruptcy; and to take all other necessary and proper actions to fulfill its duties as Administrator.
(b) The Administrator shall not be liable for any actions by it hereunder, unless due to its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith.
(c) The Administrator shall be indemnified and saved harmless by the Employer from and against all personal liability to which it may be subject by reason of
any act done or omitted to be done in its official capacity as Administrator in good faith in the administration of the Plan and Trust, including all expenses reasonably incurred in its defense in the event the Employer fails to provide such defense upon the request of the Administrator. The Administrator is relieved of all responsibility in connection with its duties hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law, short of breach of duty to the beneficiaries.
 
Benefits or payments under this Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, attachment, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, whether voluntary or involuntary, and any attempt to so anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish the same shall not be valid, nor shall any such benefit or payment be in any way liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagement or torts of any Participant or beneficiary, or any other person entitled to such benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan, except to such extent as may be required by law. If any Participant or beneficiary or any other person entitled to a benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, attach or garnish any benefit or payment under this Plan, in whole or in part, or if any attempt is made to subject any such benefit or payment, in whole or in part, to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of the Participant or beneficiary or any other person entitled to any such benefit or payment pursuant to the terms of this Plan, then such benefit or payment, in the discretion of the Administrator, shall cease and terminate with respect to such Participant or beneficiary, or any other such person.
 
Participation in this Plan shall not be construed to confer upon any Participant the legal right to be retained in the employ of the Employer, or give a Participant or beneficiary, or any other person, any right to any payment whatsoever, except to the extent of the benefits provided for hereunder. Each Participant shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if this Plan had never been adopted.
 
If the Administrator determines that any person to whom a benefit is payable under this Plan is incompetent by reason of physical or mental disability, the Administrator shall have the power to cause the payments becoming due to such person to be made to another for his or her benefit without responsibility of the Administrator or the Employer to see to the application of such payments. Any payment made pursuant to such power shall, as to such payment, operate as a complete discharge of the Employer, the Administrator and the Trustee.
If, at any time, any doubt exists as to the identity of any person entitled to any payment hereunder or the amount or time of such payment, the Administrator shall be entitled to hold such sum until such identity or amount or time is determined or until an order of a court of competent jurisdiction is obtained. The Administrator shall also be entitled to pay such sum into court in accordance with the appropriate rules of law. Any expenses incurred by the Employer, Administrator, and Trust incident to such proceeding or litigation shall be charged against the Account of the affected Participant.
 
The benefits of each Participant or beneficiary hereunder shall be in addition to any benefits paid or payable to or on account of the Participant or beneficiary under any other pension, disability, annuity or retirement plan or policy whatsoever.
 
No liability shall attach to or be incurred by any manager of the Employer, Trustee or any Administrator under or by reason of the terms, conditions and provisions contained in this Plan, or for the acts or decisions taken or made thereunder or in connection therewith; and as a condition precedent to the establishment of this Plan or the receipt of benefits thereunder, or both, such liability, if any, is expressly waived and released by each Participant and by any and all persons claiming under or through any Participant or any other person. Such waiver and release shall be conclusively evidenced by any act or participation in or the acceptance of benefits or the making of any election under this Plan.
 
All expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan, whether incurred by the Employer or the Plan, shall be paid by the Employer.
 
Should the Employer be considered insolvent (as defined by the Trust), the Employer, through its Board and chief executive officer, shall give immediate written notice of such to the Administrator of the Plan and the Trustee. Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrator or Trustee shall cease to make any payments to Participants who were Employees of the Employer or their beneficiaries and shall hold any and all assets attributable to the Employer for the benefit of the general creditors of the Employer.
(a) Right to Amend. The Board of the Employer, by written instrument, shall have the right to amend the Plan at any time and with respect to any provisions hereof, and all parties hereto or claiming any interest hereunder shall be bound by such amendment; provided, however, that no such amendment shall deprive the Participant or any beneficiary(s) of any rights accrued hereunder prior to the date of the amendment, including the right to receive the payment of his or her benefit upon a benefit entitlement event, or earlier as provided herein.
(b) Amendment Required by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Plan may be amended at any time, retroactively if required, if found necessary, in the opinion of the Board of the Employer, in order to ensure that the Plan is characterized as a non-tax-qualified plan of deferred supplemental retirement compensation maintained for members of a select group of management or highly compensated employees as described under Sections 451 and 409A of the Code, ERISA Sections 201(2), 301(a) (3) and 401 and to conform the Plan to the provisions and requirements of any applicable law including ERISA and the Code.
 
(a) Employer's Right to Terminate Plan. Subject to applicable law, the Board of the Employer reserves the right, at any time, to terminate the Plan; provided however, that no such termination shall deprive the Participant or any beneficiary of a right accrued hereunder prior to the date of termination and provided that, upon termination, the Participant shall become fully and immediately vested in his or her Account and such Account shall be held in the Plan until an appropriate distribution event as provided by this Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
(b) Termination of Plan Upon Dissolution. Subject to applicable law, the Plan shall terminate automatically upon the dissolution of the Employer. No such termination shall deprive the Participant or beneficiary(s) of a right accrued hereunder prior to the date of termination and provided that, upon termination, the Participant shall become fully and immediately vested in his or her Account and such Account shall be held in the Plan until an appropriate distribution event as provided by this Plan and Section 409A of the Code.
(c) Termination of Plan Due to Change in Control. The Employer may decide in its discretion to terminate the Plan in the event a Change in Control (as defined in Section 10.12) and distribute all Participants Accounts within twelve (12) months of the effective date of the Change in Control as allowed by law. Any corporation or other business organization that is a successor to the Employer by reason of a Change in Control shall have the right to become a party to the Plan by adopting the same by resolution of the entity's board of directors or other appropriate governing body. If within thirty (30) days from the effective date of the Change in Control such new entity does not become a party hereto, as above provided, the full amount of the Participant's Account shall become immediately distributable to the Participant.
Provided that such definition does not fail to comply with regulations to be issued by Treasury, a "Change in Control" of the Employer shall mean the first to occur of any of the following:
(a) the date that any one person or persons acting as a group acquires ownership of Employer stock constituting more than fifty percent (50%) of the total fair market value or total voting power of the Employer;
(b) the date that any one person or persons acting as a group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of the stock of the Employer possessing thirty-five percent (35%) or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Employer;
(c) the date that any one person or persons acting as a group acquires assets from the Employer that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty percent (40%) of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Employer immediately prior to such acquisition; or
(d) the date that a majority of members of the Employer's Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board prior to the date of the appointment or elections.
 
Any determinations, actions or decisions of the Employer (including but not limited to, Plan amendments and Plan termination) shall be made by the Board in accordance with its established procedures or by such other individuals, groups or organizations that have been properly delegated by the Board to make such determination or decision.
 
All questions of interpretation, construction or application arising under or concerning the terms of this Plan shall be decided by the Administrator, in its sole and final discretion, whose decision shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons.
 
This Plan shall be governed by, construed and administered in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, and any other applicable federal law, provided, however, that to the extent not preempted by federal law this Plan shall be governed by, construed and administered under the laws of the Delaware, other than its laws respecting choice of law.
If any provision of this Plan is held invalid or unenforceable, its invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Plan and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had not been included therein. If the inclusion of any Employee (or Employees) as a Participant under this Plan would cause the Plan to fail to comply with the requirements of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA, or Section 409A of the Code, then the Plan shall be severed with respect to such Employee or Employees, who shall be considered to be participating in a separate arrangement.
 
The Article headings contained herein are inserted only as a matter of convenience and for reference and in no way define, limit, enlarge or describe the scope or intent of this Plan nor in any way shall they affect this Plan or the construction of any provision thereof.
 
Capitalized terms shall have meanings as defined herein. Singular nouns shall be read as plural, masculine pronouns shall be read as feminine, and vice versa, as appropriate.
 
The Plan is intended to comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and shall be administered in accordance with Section 409A of the Code to the extent Section 409A of the Code applies to the Plan. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, deferrals and distributions under the Plan may only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted by Section 409A of the Code. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Plan may only be made upon a "separation from service" within the meaning of such term under Section 409A of the Code. If a payment is not made by the designated payment date under the Plan, the payment shall be made by December 31 of the calendar year in which the designated payment date occurs. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would cause a conflict with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, such provision shall be deemed null and void. In no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar year of payment.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Cognizant Technology Solutions U.S. Corp. has caused this instrument to be executed by its duly authorized officer, effective as of this day of , 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Teaneck, NJ  February 13, 2009  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services, today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.
Highlights  Fourth Quarter 2008
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 rose to $753.0 million, up 2.5% from $734.7 million in the third quarter of 2008, and up 26% from $600.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. GAAP net income was $112.3 million or $0.38 per diluted share compared to $96.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.41. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.9%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $10.9 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit taxes of $0.7 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5%, above the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Earnings for the quarter include $11.4 million, or $0.03 per share, of non-operating foreign currency exchange losses primarily resulting from the weakness in the British Pound during the period. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2008 financial performance. We exceeded our most recent revenue guidance and continued to generate industry-leading growth," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "The Cognizant value proposition stems from our deep understanding of the industry-specific and cyclical issues our clients confront. Our 2008 results demonstrate that even in the face of significant economic headwinds, clients turn to Cognizant as a trusted advisor to help them improve business performance and tap into new growth opportunities in an evolving economy."
Mr. D'Souza continued: "As we look forward to 2009, we will continue to reinvest in our business in order to capitalize on opportunities for continued growth and increased market share. We are committed to maintaining our culture of openness and transparency and our tradition of the highest standards of ethics and corporate governance in our dealings with customers, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders."
Highlights  Full Year 2008
 
 
 
Revenue for 2008 increased to $2.816 billion, up 32% from $2.136 billion for 2007. GAAP net income was $430.8 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, compared to $350.1 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, for 2007. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.59. GAAP operating margin was 18.3%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $43.9 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit taxes of $8.1 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included in the table at the end of this release.
2009 Outlook  First Quarter & Full Year
Based on current global economic weakness and recent customer feedback, the Company is now providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"During 2008 we managed prudently, expanded selectively, and reinvested succinctly to maintain our industry-leading growth and distinct competitive differentiation," concluded Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "In addition, we finished the year with the strongest balance sheet in
our history, including over $924 million in cash and short-term/long-term investments. We believe that Cognizant is well-positioned to face the global economic challenges of the coming year and to continue to deliver value to our customers and, thereby, our shareholders."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we
believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation and the related stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

. The Compensation Committee also approved a cash bonus program for the 2009 calendar year (the "2009 Bonus Program") pursuant to the Performance-Based Award provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated 1999 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The 2009 Bonus Program provides cash bonus opportunities for selected executive officers of the Company, including certain of the Named Executive
2009 Bonus Program
 
Officers. Each participant in the 2009 Bonus Program is assigned a target bonus, expressed as a percentage of the participant's annual base salary for the 2009 calendar year, to which they will become entitled if the applicable performance objectives are attained. The table below sets forth the applicable percentages for the Company's Named Executive Officers under the 2009 Bonus Program, which are the same applicable percentages for the Named Executive Officers as those in effect for the 2008 calendar year.
 
The performance period for the 2009 Bonus Program is coincidental with the 2009 calendar year and the performance objectives for such performance period are tied to the Company's performance for such period measured in terms of the following financial metrics: (i) revenue, (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation costs and related fringe benefit taxes, subject to certain adjustments, and (iii) days sales are outstanding. The Compensation Committee has established threshold, target and maximum levels for each metric. The actual bonus to be paid per participant will be determined on the basis of the level at which each metric is actually attained, and each metric will be measured separately in terms of actual level of attainment and appropriately weighted in order to establish the individual bonus amount per participant. To the extent any performance metric is attained at a level between two of the designated levels, the bonus amount payable with respect to that metric will be determined on the basis of straight-line interpolation between those two levels.
In addition, the Compensation Committee determined that the maximum bonus payable per participant will not exceed two times his or her target bonus amount for the 2009 Bonus Program, and in no event will the bonus paid to any participant be in such amount so as to exceed the $10 million cumulative limitation in effect per person for the term of the Plan.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation and the related stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Appointment of New Director
On May 26, 2009, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company"), the Board increased the size of the Board from seven members to eight members and appointed Maureen Breakiron-Evans to the Board as a Class I Director to fill the new vacancy. Ms. Breakiron-Evans will serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held in 2010. In connection with the appointment of Ms. Breakiron-Evans to the Board, she was also appointed to serve as a member of the Company's Audit Committee.
Ms. Breakiron-Evans, age 55, served as Chief Financial Officer of Towers Perrin from January 2007 until April 2008, where she was the head of Financial Resources and responsible for the firm's financial strategy. From February 2005 until October 2007, Ms. Breakiron-Evans served as Vice President and General Auditor of CIGNA Corporation where she was responsible for managing the enterprise risk management and internal audit functions. From 2001 to 2004, Ms. Breakiron-Evans served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Inovant, LLC, which is Visa's captive technology development and transaction processing company. Prior to that, Ms. Breakiron-Evans held several positions at Transamerica Corporation in San Francisco including Vice President and General Auditor, Vice President of Control and Services and President of Transamerica Business Technologies Corp. Ms. Breakiron-Evans began her career as a financial auditor, ultimately serving as an Audit Partner with Arthur Andersen & Co. Ms. Breakiron-Evans received a BBA from Stetson University, an MBA from Harvard Business School and an MLA from Stanford University. She is also a certified public accountant in the State of California.
The Board determined that Ms. Breakiron-Evans has no relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, that would be inconsistent with a determination of independence under the applicable rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither Ms. Breakiron-Evans nor any member of her immediate family has engaged, directly or indirectly, in any transaction, or series of similar transactions, with the Company or any of its subsidiaries since January 1, 2008 in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. In addition, Ms. Breakiron-Evans does not have any family relationship with any executive officer or director of the Company.
Ms. Breakiron-Evans shall receive compensation for serving on the Board pursuant to the new non-employee director compensation guidelines that are disclosed below. Pursuant to such compensation plan and subject to the approval of the Company's new 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") by the Company's stockholders at the Company's 2009 Annual Meeting (the "Annual Meeting"), on the date of the Company's Annual Meeting which is currently scheduled for June 5, 2009, the Company shall grant Ms. Breakiron-Evans a stock unit equal in value to $160,000 as measured by the closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock") on the grant date (rounded down to the nearest whole share). Such stock grant shall vest ratably on an annual basis over three years. The shares issuable under the stock unit shall be issued upon Ms. Breakiron-Evans's termination of service from the Board. Subject to stockholder approval of the Plan, Ms. Breakiron-Evans shall also receive options to purchase 10,000 shares of Class A Common Stock as described below.
 
Amendment of Non-Employee Director Compensation Guidelines
The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") recently undertook a review of the compensation arrangements for its non-employee directors. The purpose of the review was to ensure that the Company continued to provide cash and equity based compensation at levels that allowed the Company to attract and retain qualified Board members. Following such review and in consultation with compensation advisory firm, Watson Wyatt, on May 26, 2009, the Compensation Committee amended certain director compensation guidelines for the Company's non-employee directors serving on the Company's Board and its committees which shall be effective following the Company's Annual Meeting. The new guidelines provide the following:
 
 
 
Grants of Stock Options to Certain Directors
On May 26, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved the grant, effective after the close of regular trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of the Annual Meeting (currently scheduled for June 5, 2009) and subject to stockholder approval of the Plan at the Annual Meeting, to Lakshmi Narayanan and the non-employee directors the following awards of stock options ("Stock Options") to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock, at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on the grant date:
 
Such Stock Options shall be subject to stockholder approval of the Plan at the Annual Meeting and shall be in accordance with the applicable form of stock option agreement. The Stock Options vest in 2 equal annual installments, with 50% of the Stock Options vesting on the one year anniversary of the grant date and 50% of the Stock Options vesting on the two year anniversary of the grant date, so that the Stock Options will be fully vested on the two year anniversary of the grant date.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: June 1, 2009

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: June 11, 2009

Exhibit 10.1
 
This 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan is intended to promote the business success and interests of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation, by providing eligible persons in the Corporation's service with the opportunity to participate in one or more cash or equity incentive compensation programs designed to encourage them to continue their service relationship with the Corporation and to contribute to the Corporation's growth and long-term success.
Capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the attached Appendix.
 
A. The Plan shall be divided into three separate incentive compensation programs:
    the Discretionary Grant Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock or stock appreciation rights tied to the value of such Common Stock,
    the Stock Issuance Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be issued shares of Common Stock pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance shares or other stock-based awards which vest upon the completion of a designated service period and/or the attainment of pre-established performance milestones, or such shares of Common Stock may be issued through direct purchase or as a bonus for services rendered to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary), and
    the Incentive Bonus Program under which eligible persons may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be provided with bonus opportunities through performance unit awards and other special cash incentive programs tied to the attainment of pre-established performance milestones.
B. The provisions of Articles One and Five shall apply to all incentive compensation programs under the Plan and shall govern the interests of all persons under the Plan.
 
A. The Compensation Committee shall have sole and exclusive authority to administer the Plan with respect to Section 16 Insiders. Administration of the Plan with respect to all other persons eligible to participate in the Plan may, at the Board's discretion, be vested in the Compensation Committee or a Secondary Board Committee, or the Board may retain the power to administer those programs with respect to all such persons. In addition, administration of the Plan may, at the Board's discretion, be vested in a Special Award Committee with authority to administer the Plan with respect to employees other than Section 16 Insiders and members of such Special Award Committee and to make Awards to such individuals under the Plan subject to such limitations and other terms and conditions as the Board shall specify from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Awards for one or more members of the Compensation Committee (other than ad hoc or formulaic Awards made to all or substantially all of the non-employee Board members on substantially the same basis) must be authorized by a disinterested majority of the non-employee Board members.
 
B. Members of the Compensation Committee or any Secondary Board Committee or Special Award Committee shall serve for such period of time as the Board may determine and may be removed by the Board at any time. The Board may also at any time terminate the functions of any Secondary Board Committee or Special Award Committee and reassume all powers and authority previously delegated to such committee.
C. Each Plan Administrator shall, within the scope of its administrative functions under the Plan, have full power and authority (subject to the provisions of the Plan) to establish such rules and regulations as it may deem appropriate for proper administration of the Plan and to make such determinations under, and issue such interpretations of, the provisions of the Plan and any outstanding Awards thereunder as it may deem necessary or advisable. Decisions of the Plan Administrator within the scope of its administrative functions under the Plan shall be final and binding on all parties who have an interest in the Plan under its jurisdiction or any Award thereunder.
D. Service as a Plan Administrator by the members of the Compensation Committee or the Secondary Board Committee shall constitute service as Board members, and the members of each such committee shall accordingly be entitled to full indemnification and reimbursement as Board members for their service on such committee. No member of the Compensation Committee, the Special Award Committee or the Secondary Board Committee shall be liable for any act or omission made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award thereunder.
 
A. The persons eligible to participate in the Plan are as follows:
(i) Employees,
(ii) non-employee members of the Board or the board of directors of any Parent or Subsidiary, and
(iii) consultants and other independent advisors who provide services to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary).
B. The Plan Administrator shall have full authority to determine, (i) with respect to Awards made under the Discretionary Grant Program, which eligible persons are to receive such Awards, the time or times when those Awards are to be made, the number of shares to be covered by each such Award, the time or times when the Award is to become exercisable, the vesting schedule (if any) applicable to the Award, the maximum term for which such Award is to remain outstanding and the status of a granted option as either an Incentive Option or a Non-Statutory Option; (ii) with respect to Awards under the Stock Issuance Program, which eligible persons are to receive such Awards, the time or times when the Awards are to be made, the number of shares subject to each such Award, the applicable performance and/or service vesting provisions, the issuance schedule in effect for the shares that vest and become issuable under such Award, the cash consideration (if any) payable for those shares and the form (cash or shares of Common Stock) in which the Award is to be settled; and (iii) with respect to Awards under the Incentive Bonus Program, which eligible persons are to receive such Awards, the time or times when the Awards are to be made, the performance objectives for each such Award, the amounts payable at designated levels of attained performance, any applicable service vesting requirements, the payout schedule for each such Award and the form (cash or shares of Common Stock) in which the Award is to be settled.
 
A. The stock issuable under the Plan shall be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock, including shares repurchased by the Corporation on the open market. The number of shares of Common Stock initially reserved for issuance over the term of the Plan shall be limited to Twenty-Four Million (24,000,000) shares. The Plan shall serve as the successor to the Predecessor Plans, and no further stock option grants or other awards shall be made under the Predecessor Plans on or after the Plan Effective Date. However, all option grants and unvested share awards outstanding under the Predecessor Plans on the Plan Effective Date
 
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and no provision of this Plan shall be deemed to affect or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of those awards with respect to their acquisition of shares of Common Stock thereunder.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each share of Common Stock issued without cash consideration pursuant to the Stock Issuance or the Incentive Bonus Program, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by 1.55 shares of Common Stock.
C. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to Incentive Options granted under the Plan shall be limited to Twenty-Four Million (24,000,000) shares, subject to periodic adjustment in accordance with Section V.G. of this Article One.
D. Each person participating in the Plan shall be subject the following limitations:
    for Awards denominated in shares of Common Stock at the time of grant (whether subsequently payable in cash or Common Stock, or a combination of both), the maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which such Awards may be made to such person in any calendar year shall not exceed One Million (1,000,000) shares of Common Stock in the aggregate, and
    for Awards denominated in dollars at the time of grant (whether subsequently payable in cash or Common Stock, or a combination of both), the maximum dollar amount for which such Awards may be made to such person in any calendar year shall not exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).
E. Shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Awards made under the Plan shall be available for subsequent issuance under the Plan to the extent those Awards expire or terminate for any reason prior to the issuance of the shares of Common Stock subject to those Awards. Unvested shares issued under the Plan and subsequently forfeited or repurchased by the Corporation, at a price per share not greater than the original issue price paid per share, pursuant to the Corporation's repurchase rights under the Plan shall be added back to the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan and shall accordingly be available for subsequent reissuance.
F. Should the exercise price of an option under the Plan be paid with shares of Common Stock, then the authorized reserve of Common Stock under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which that option is exercised, and not by the net number of shares issued under the exercised stock option. Upon the exercise of any stock appreciation right under the Plan, the share reserve shall be reduced by the gross number of shares as to which such right is exercised, and not by the net number of shares actually issued by the Corporation upon such exercise. If shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable under the Plan are withheld by the Corporation in satisfaction of the withholding taxes or other taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, vesting or exercise of an Award or the issuance of Common Stock thereunder (including, without limitation any fringe benefit or employer taxes permitted to be passed through to the employee under applicable law), then the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced on the basis of the gross number of shares issued, vested or exercised under such Award, calculated in each instance prior to any such share withholding.
G. Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration, or should the value of outstanding shares of Common Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, or should there occur any merger, consolidation or other reorganization, then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Plan Administrator to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number and/or class of securities by which the share reserve will be reduced for each security issued without cash consideration under the Stock Issuance and Incentive Bonus Programs, (iii) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan pursuant to Incentive Options, (iv) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted Common
 
Stock-denominated Awards under the Plan per calendar year, (v) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise or base price per share in effect under each outstanding Award under the Discretionary Grant Program, (vi) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award under the Stock Issuance Program and the cash consideration (if any) payable per share, (vii) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award under the Incentive Bonus Program denominated in shares of Common Stock and (viii) the number and/or class of securities subject to the Corporation's outstanding repurchase rights under the Plan and the repurchase price payable per share. The adjustments shall be made in such manner as the Plan Administrator deems appropriate and such adjustments shall be final, binding and conclusive. In the event of a Change in Control, however, the adjustments (if any) shall be made solely in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan governing Change in Control transactions.
H. Outstanding Awards granted pursuant to the Plan shall in no way affect the right of the Corporation to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
 
 
Each option shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; that each such Award Agreement shall comply with the terms specified below. Each Award Agreement evidencing an Incentive Option shall, in addition, be subject to the provisions of the Plan applicable to such options.
provided, however,
A. .
Exercise Price
1. The exercise price per share shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator; , , that such exercise price shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the grant date.
provided
however
2. The exercise price shall become immediately due upon exercise of the option and shall, subject to the provisions of the Award Agreement, be payable in one or more of the forms specified below:
(i) cash or check made payable to the Corporation,
(ii) shares of Common Stock (whether delivered in the form of actual stock certificates or through attestation of ownership) held for the requisite period (if any) necessary to avoid any resulting charge to the Corporation's earnings for financial reporting purposes and valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date,
(iii) to the extent the option is exercised for vested shares of Common Stock, through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant to which the Optionee shall concurrently provide instructions to (a) a brokerage firm (reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation for purposes of administering such procedure in compliance with the Corporation's pre-clearance/pre-notification policies) to effect the immediate sale of all or a portion of the purchased shares and remit to the Corporation, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the purchased shares plus all applicable income and employment taxes and Foreign Taxes required to be withheld by the Corporation by reason of such exercise and any employer taxes required to be paid by the Optionee under Section V.B, V.C or V.D of this Article II and (b) the Corporation to deliver the certificates for the purchased shares directly to such brokerage firm on such settlement date in order to complete the sale, or
(iv) to the extent the option is at the time exercisable for vested shares of Common Stock, through the surrender to the Corporation of all or any part of that vested portion for an appreciation distribution payable in shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value at the time of such option surrender equal to the dollar amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the surrendered portion exceeds the aggregate exercise price payable for those shares of Common Stock, with any resulting fractional share to be rounded down to the next whole share.
Except to the extent such sale and remittance procedure is utilized, payment of the exercise price for the purchased shares must be made on the Exercise Date.
B.
Term and Exercisability of Options.
1. No option shall have a term in excess of seven (7) years measured from the option grant date. Unless a shorter term is specified in the Award Agreement, each option under the Discretionary Grant Program shall have such a seven (7)-year maximum term.
2. Unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement, each option shall vest and become exercisable for twenty-five percent (25%) of the option shares upon the Optionee's completion of each year of Service over the four (4)-year period measured from the grant date. In no event, however, shall such option be exercisable for fractional shares.
 
3. The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section 162(m), to structure one or more Awards under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those Awards shall vest and become exercisable only after the achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives based on one or more Performance Goals and measured over the performance period specified by the Plan Administrator at the time of the Award
C. .
Effect of Termination of Service
1. Unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement, the following provisions shall govern the exercise of any options granted to an Optionee pursuant to the Discretionary Grant Program that are outstanding at the time of his or her cessation of Service or death:
(i) Should Optionee cease to remain in Service for any reason (other than death, Permanent Disability, Misconduct or Cause) while an option is outstanding, then Optionee (or any person or persons to whom an option is transferred pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph F below) shall have a three (3)-month period measured from the date of such cessation of Service during which to exercise the option, but in no event shall the option be exercisable at any time after the expiration of the option term.
(ii) Should Optionee die while his or her option is outstanding, then the option may be exercised by (i) the personal representative of Optionee's estate or (ii) the person or persons to whom the option is transferred pursuant to Optionee's will or the laws of inheritance following Optionee's death or (iii) the person to whom the option is transferred during Optionee's lifetime pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph F below, as the case may be. However, if Optionee dies while holding an outstanding option under the Discretionary Grant Program and has an effective beneficiary designation in effect for that option at the time of his or her death, then the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries shall have the exclusive right to exercise the option following Optionee's death. Any such right to exercise the option shall lapse, and the option shall cease to be outstanding, upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the twelve (12)-month period measured from the date of Optionee's death and (ii) the expiration of the option term.
(iii) Should Optionee cease Service by reason of Permanent Disability while his or her option is outstanding, then Optionee (or any person or persons to whom this option is transferred pursuant to a permitted transfer under Paragraph F below) shall have a twelve (12)-month period measured from the date of such cessation of Service during which to exercise the option. In no event shall the option be exercisable at any time after the expiration of the option term.
(iv) The applicable period of post-Service exercisability in effect pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph C.1 shall automatically be extended by an additional period of time equal in duration to any interval within such post-Service exercise period during which the exercise of the option or the immediate sale of the underlying shares of Common Stock purchasable under that option cannot be effected in compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws, but in no event shall such an extension result in the extension of the option beyond the expiration of the maximum option term.
(v) During the limited period of post-Service exercisability, the option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of shares of Common Stock for which such option is, at the time of Optionee's cessation of Service, vested and exercisable pursuant to the vesting provisions of Paragraph B.2 above or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Section IV.A of this Article Two. The option shall not vest or become exercisable for any additional underlying shares of Common Stock, whether pursuant to the normal vesting provisions of Paragraph B.2 above or the special vesting acceleration provisions of Section IV.A of this Article Two, following Optionee's cessation of Service, except to the extent (if any) specifically authorized by the Plan Administrator pursuant to an express written agreement with Optionee. Upon the expiration of such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the expiration of the term, the option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any exercisable shares of Common Stock for which the option has not otherwise been exercised.
(vi) Should Optionee's Service be terminated for Misconduct or Cause or should Optionee otherwise engage in any Misconduct or other act or omission constituting grounds for termination for Cause while his or her option is outstanding, then such option, whether vested or unvested at the time, shall terminate immediately and cease to remain outstanding.

(i) extend the period of time for which the option is to remain exercisable following Optionee's cessation of Service from the limited exercise period otherwise in effect for that option to such greater period of time as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate, but in no event beyond the expiration of the option term, and/or
(ii) permit the option to be exercised, during the applicable post-Service exercise period, not only with respect to the number of vested shares of Common Stock for which such option is exercisable at the time of Optionee's cessation of Service but also with respect to one or more additional shares in which Optionee would have vested had Optionee continued in Service.
D. The holder of an option shall have no stockholder rights with respect to the shares subject to the option until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the exercise price and become a holder of record of the purchased shares.
Stockholder Rights.
E. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretion to grant options which are exercisable for unvested shares of Common Stock. Should the Optionee cease Service while such shares are unvested, the Corporation shall have the right to repurchase any or all of those unvested shares at a price per share equal to the of (i) the exercise price paid per share or (ii) the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock at the time of repurchase. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable (including the period and procedure for exercise and the appropriate vesting schedule for the purchased shares) shall be established by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right.

In addition, one or more beneficiaries may be designated for an outstanding Stand-Alone Right in accordance with substantially the same terms and provisions as set forth in Section I.F of this Article Two.
5. The distribution with respect to an exercised Stand-Alone Right may be made in (i) shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the exercise date, (ii) cash or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as the Plan Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion.

Post-Service Exercise
 
A. In the event of an actual Change in Control transaction, each Award outstanding at that time under the Discretionary Grant Program but not otherwise fully vested and exercisable shall automatically accelerate and become exercisable immediately prior to the effective date of that Change in Control as to all of the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to such Award, unless (i) such Award is to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or is otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such Award is to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the spread existing at the time on the Change in Control on any shares as to which the Award is not otherwise at that time vested and exercisable and provides for the subsequent vesting and payout of that spread in accordance with the same exercise/vesting schedule in effect for that Award or (iii) the acceleration of such Award is subject to other limitations imposed by the Plan Administrator.
 
B. All outstanding repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program shall automatically terminate, and the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall immediately vest in full, immediately prior to the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction, except to the extent: (i) those repurchase rights are to be assigned to the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or are otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction or (ii) such accelerated vesting is precluded by other limitations imposed by the Plan Administrator.
C. Immediately following the consummation of the Change in Control, all outstanding Awards under the Discretionary Grant Program shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to the extent assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or otherwise continued in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.
D. Each Award under the Discretionary Grant Program which is assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after such Change in Control, to apply to the number and class of securities into which the shares of Common Stock subject to that Award would have been converted in consummation of such Change in Control had those shares actually been outstanding at that time. Equitable adjustments to reflect such Change in Control shall also be made to (i) the exercise or base price per share in effect under each such assumed Award under the Discretionary Grant Program, the aggregate exercise or base price in effect for such securities shall remain the same, (ii) the maximum number and/or class of securities available for issuance over the remaining term of the Plan, (iii) the number and/or class of securities by which the share reserve will be reduced for each security issued without cash consideration under the Stock Issuance and Incentive Bonus Programs, (iv) the maximum number and/or class of securities which may be issued pursuant to Incentive Options granted under the Plan, (v) the maximum number and/or class of securities for which any one person may be granted Common Stock-denominated Awards under the Plan per calendar year, (vi) the number and/or class of securities and the exercise or base price per share in effect under each outstanding Award under the Discretionary Grant Program, (vii) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award under the Stock Issuance Program and the cash consideration (if any) payable per share, (viii) the number and/or class of securities subject to each outstanding Award under the Incentive Bonus Program denominated in shares of Common Stock and (ix) the number and/or class of securities subject to the Corporation's outstanding repurchase rights under the Plan and the repurchase price payable per share. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding Awards under the Discretionary Grant Program and subject to the Plan Administrator's approval, substitute, for the securities underlying those assumed rights, one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction, provided such common stock is readily traded on an established U.S. securities exchange.
provided
E. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more outstanding Awards under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those Awards shall, immediately prior to the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction, vest and become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to those Awards and may be exercised as to any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock, whether or not those Awards are to be assumed in the Change in Control transaction or otherwise continued in effect. In addition, the Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more of the Corporation's repurchase rights under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those rights shall terminate immediately prior to the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction, and the shares subject to those terminated rights shall thereupon vest in full.
F. The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority to structure one or more outstanding Awards under the Discretionary Grant Program so that those Awards shall vest and become exercisable as to all the shares of Common Stock at the time subject to those Awards in the event the Optionee's Service is subsequently terminated by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of any Change in Control transaction in which those Awards do not otherwise fully accelerate. In addition, the Plan
 
Administrator may structure one or more of the Corporation's repurchase rights so that those rights shall immediately terminate with respect to any shares held by the Optionee at the time of such Involuntary Termination, and the shares subject to those terminated repurchase rights shall accordingly vest in full at that time.
G. The portion of any Incentive Option accelerated in connection with a Change in Control shall remain exercisable as an Incentive Option only to the extent the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation is not exceeded. To the extent such dollar limitation is exceeded, the accelerated portion of such option shall be exercisable as a Non-statutory Option under the Federal tax laws.
 
A. The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock or make a cash payment in connection with the grant, exercise, vesting or settlement of any Award under this Discretionary Grant Program shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable income and employment taxes, and Foreign Tax withholding requirements, any employer taxes passed through to the Optionee under Section V.B, V.C or V.D of this Article II and any other taxes required to be collected at the time of the grant, exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award. Accordingly, no shares shall be issued or cash payment made with respect to an outstanding Award under this Discretionary Grant Program until all such taxes have been collected.
B. Any Optionee who is subject to taxation in India shall be required to pay any fringe benefits or other tax payable by the Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing such Optionee) as a result of or with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award under the Discretionary Grant Program or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder (the "Employer Option Taxes"). Optionee must pay such Employer Option Taxes at such times and in such form as determined by the Corporation (or such Parent or Subsidiary).
C. Any Optionee who is subject to taxation in the United Kingdom shall be liable for and pay all secondary Class 1 National Insurance Contributions which may be payable by the Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing such Optionee) arising in connection with the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award under the Discretionary Grant Program or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder (the "Employer Option NIC"). The Optionee must pay such Employer Option NIC at such times and in such form as determined by the Corporation (or such Parent or Subsidiary).
D. Any Optionee subject to taxation in any jurisdiction shall pay any taxes or other amounts required to be paid by the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing such Options) with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award under this Discretionary Grant Program or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder, to the extent those taxes or other amounts are permitted to be passed through to the Optionee under applicable law. The Optionee must pay any such taxes or other amounts at such times and in such form as determined by the Corporation.
E. The Optionee shall enter into such additional agreements as may be required by the Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing Optionee) to effect the transfer of the Employer Option Taxes, Employer Option NIC and any other taxes or payments from the Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing Optionee) to the Optionee.
 
The Plan Administrator shall not (i) implement any cancellation/regrant program pursuant to which outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Plan are cancelled and new options or stock appreciation rights are granted in replacement with a lower exercise price per share, (ii) cancel outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Plan with exercise prices per share in excess of the then current Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock for consideration payable in cash or equity securities of the Corporation or (iii) otherwise directly reduce the exercise price in effect for outstanding options or stock appreciation rights under the Plan, without in each such instance obtaining stockholder approval.
 
 
Shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program, either as vested or unvested shares, through direct and immediate issuances. Shares of Common Stock may also be issued under the Stock Issuance Program pursuant to performance shares or restricted stock units which entitle the recipients to receive the shares underlying those Awards upon the attainment of designated Performance Goals or the satisfaction of specified Service requirements or upon the expiration of a designated time period following the vesting of those Awards. Each Award under the Stock Issuance Program shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; , that each such Award Agreement shall comply with the terms specified below.
provided, however
A. .
Issue Price/Consideration
1. Shares of Common Stock may be issued under the Stock Issuance Program for any of the following items of consideration which the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate in each individual instance:
(i) cash or check made payable to the Corporation,
(ii) past services rendered to the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary); or
(iii) any other valid consideration under the State in which the Corporation is at the time incorporated.
2. However, for shares of Common Stock to be issued for cash consideration, the cash consideration payable per share shall be fixed by the Plan Administrator at the time of the Award, but in no event shall such cash consideration be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Award date.
B. .
Vesting Provisions
1. Shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program may, in the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be fully and immediately vested upon issuance as a bonus for Service rendered or may vest in one or more installments over the Participant's period of Service and/or upon the attainment of specified performance objectives. The elements of the vesting schedule applicable to any unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and incorporated into the Award Agreement. Shares of Common Stock may also be issued under the Stock Issuance Program pursuant to performance shares or restricted stock units which entitle the recipients to receive the shares underlying those Awards upon the attainment of designated performance goals and/or the satisfaction of specified Service requirements or upon the expiration of a designated time period following the vesting of those Awards, including (without limitation) a deferred distribution date on or after termination of the Participant's Service, or upon the occurrence of such other dates or events as determined by the Plan Administrator, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following limitations shall apply with respect to the vesting schedules established for the Awards made under the Stock Issuance Program, subject to the acceleration provisions of Paragraphs B.7 and B.8 below and Section II of this Article Three:
(i) for any such Award which is to vest on the basis of Service, the minimum vesting period shall be three (3) years, with such vesting to occur in one or more installments over that period as determined by the Plan Administrator, but in no event more favorably than monthly; and
(ii) for any such Award which is to vest on the basis of performance objectives, the performance period shall have a duration of at least one year.
 
2. The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section 162(m), to structure one or more Awards under the Stock Issuance Program so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those Awards shall vest (or vest and become issuable) upon the achievement of pre-established performance objectives based on one or more Performance Goals and measured over the performance period specified by the Plan Administrator at the time of the Award.
3. The Participant shall have full stockholder rights with respect to any shares of Common Stock issued to the Participant under the Stock Issuance Program, whether or not the Participant's interest in those shares is vested. Accordingly, the Participant shall have the right to vote such shares and to receive any dividends paid on such shares, subject to any applicable vesting requirements. The Participant shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to a performance share or restricted stock unit Award until that Award vests and the shares of Common Stock are actually issued thereunder. However, dividend-equivalent units may be paid or credited, either in cash or in actual or phantom shares of Common Stock, on outstanding performance share or restricted stock unit Awards, subject to such terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may deem appropriate.
4. Any new, substituted or additional securities or other property (including money paid other than as a regular cash dividend) which the Participant may have the right to receive with respect to the Participant's unvested shares of Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction, extraordinary dividend or distribution or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Corporation's receipt of consideration shall be issued subject to (i) the same vesting requirements applicable to the Participant's unvested shares of Common Stock and (ii) such escrow arrangements as the Plan Administrator shall deem appropriate. Equitable adjustments to reflect each such transaction shall also be made by the Plan Administrator to the repurchase price payable per share by the Corporation for any unvested securities subject to its existing repurchase rights under the Plan; provided the aggregate repurchase price shall in each instance remain the same.
5. Should the Participant cease to remain in Service while holding one or more unvested shares of Common Stock issued under the Stock Issuance Program or should the performance objectives not be attained with respect to one or more such unvested shares of Common Stock, then those shares shall be immediately surrendered to the Corporation for cancellation, and the Participant shall have no further stockholder rights with respect to those shares. To the extent the surrendered shares were previously issued to the Participant for consideration paid in cash or cash equivalent, the Corporation shall repay to the Participant the of (i) the cash consideration paid for the surrendered shares or (ii) the Fair Market Value of those shares at the time of cancellation.
lower
6. The Plan Administrator may in its discretion waive the surrender and cancellation of one or more unvested shares of Common Stock which would otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant's Service or the non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those shares. Any such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant's interest in the shares of Common Stock as to which the waiver applies. Such waiver may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant's cessation of Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance objectives. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of performance objectives may be waived with respect to shares which were intended at the time of issuance to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except as otherwise provided in Section II of this Article Three.
7. Outstanding performance shares or restricted stock units under the Stock Issuance Program shall automatically terminate, and no shares of Common Stock shall actually be issued in satisfaction of those Awards, if the performance goals or Service requirements established for those Awards are not attained or satisfied. The Plan Administrator, however, shall have the discretionary authority to issue vested shares of Common Stock under one or more outstanding Awards of performance shares or restricted stock units as to which the designated performance goals or Service requirements have not been attained or satisfied. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of performance goals may be waived with respect to Awards which were intended, at the time those Awards were made, to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except as otherwise provided in Section II of this Article Three.
 
8. The following additional requirements shall be in effect for any performance shares awarded under this Article Three:
(i) At the end of the performance period, the Plan Administrator shall determine and confirm the actual level of attainment for each performance objective and the extent to which the performance shares awarded for that period are to vest and become payable based on the attained performance levels.
(ii) The performance shares which so vest shall be paid as soon as practicable following the end of the performance period, unless such payment is to be deferred for the period specified by the Plan Administrator at the time the performance shares are initially awarded or the period designated by the Participant pursuant to a timely deferral election in accordance with the applicable requirements of Code Section 409A.
(iii) Performance shares may be paid in (i) cash, (ii) shares of Common Stock or (iii) any combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Award Agreement, the distribution shall be made in shares of Common Stock.
(iv) Performance shares may also be structured so that the shares are convertible into shares of Common Stock, but the rate at which each performance share is to so convert shall be based on the attained level of performance for each applicable performance objective.
 
A. Each outstanding Award under the Stock Issuance Program may be assumed in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise continued in effect. Each Award so assumed or continued in effect shall be adjusted immediately after the consummation of that Change in Control so as to apply to the number and class of securities into which the shares of Common Stock subject to that Award immediately prior to the Change in Control would have been converted in consummation of such Change in Control had those shares actually been outstanding at that time, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the cash consideration (if any) payable per share thereunder, provided the aggregate consideration shall remain the same. To the extent the actual holders of the Corporation's outstanding Common Stock receive cash consideration for their Common Stock in consummation of the Change in Control, the successor corporation may, in connection with the assumption or continuation of the outstanding Awards and subject to the Plan Administrator's approval, substitute one or more shares of its own common stock with a fair market value equivalent to the cash consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such Change in Control transaction, provided such common stock is readily traded on an established U.S. securities exchange.
B. If an Award under the Stock Issuance Program is not assumed or otherwise continued in effect or replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares of Common Stock at the time of the Change in Control and provides for the subsequent vesting and payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting and issuance schedule in effect for those shares at the time of such Change in Control, then such Award shall vest, and the shares of Common Stock subject to that Award shall be issued as fully-vested shares, immediately prior to the effective date of the Change in Control or at such other time as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.
C. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more unvested Awards under the Stock Issuance Program so that the shares of Common Stock subject to those Awards shall automatically vest (or vest and become issuable) in whole or in part on the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction or upon the subsequent termination of the Participant's Service by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of that Change in Control transaction.
D. The Plan Administrator's authority under Paragraph C of this Section II shall also extend to any Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), even though the automatic vesting of those Awards may result in their loss of performance-based status under Code Section 162(m).
 
E. All of the Corporation's outstanding repurchase rights under the Stock Issuance Program shall terminate automatically, and all the shares of Common Stock subject to those terminated rights shall vest in full, immediately prior to the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction, except to the extent (i) the Awards to which those repurchase rights are to be assumed by the successor corporation (or parent thereof) or are otherwise to continue in full force and effect pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction, (ii) those Awards are to be replaced with a cash incentive program of the successor corporation which preserves, for each such Award, the Fair Market Value of the underlying shares of Common Stock at the time of the Change in Control and provides for the subsequent vesting and payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting schedule in effect for those shares at the time of such Change in Control or (iii) such accelerated vesting is precluded by other limitations imposed in the Stock Issuance Agreement.
 
A. The Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing Participant) shall collect the employee portion of the U.S. FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare) with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to an Award issued under this Stock Issuance Program at the time those shares vest. Such taxes shall be based on the Fair Market Value of such shares on their vesting date. The Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing Participant) shall also collect the employee portion of the FICA taxes with respect to any dividend equivalents payable pursuant to the Award at the time those dividend equivalents vest. Such taxes shall be based on the cash amount and the fair market value of any other property underlying the dividend equivalents on the vesting date. Unless the Participant delivers a separate check payable to the Corporation in the amount of the FICA taxes required to be withheld from the Participant, the Corporation shall withhold those taxes from the Participant's wages. However, if the Participant is at the time an executive officer of the Corporation, then such withholding taxes must be collected from the Participant through delivery of his or her separate check not later than the vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any shares of Common Stock to be issued immediately upon vesting or for any divided equivalents to be paid immediately upon vesting, the employee portion of the applicable FICA taxes shall be collected in the same manner as the federal, state and local income taxes are to be withheld under Section III.B below. The foregoing tax collection provisions shall also be applicable to the employee portion of any Foreign Taxes that become due and payable upon the vesting of the shares of Common Stock subject to an Award issued under this Stock Issuance Program.
B. The Corporation shall collect the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and/or all applicable Foreign Taxes required to be withheld with respect to the distribution of the phantom dividend equivalents to the Participant by withholding a portion of that distribution equal to the amount of those taxes, with the cash portion of the distribution to be the first portion so withheld.
C. Until such time as the Corporation provides the Participant with written or electronic notice to the contrary, the Corporation shall collect the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and/or all applicable Foreign Taxes required to be withheld with respect to the issuance of the vested shares of Common Stock subject to the Award outstanding under this Stock Issuance Program through an automatic share withholding procedure pursuant to which the Corporation will withhold, at the time of such issuance, the number of shares (rounded up to the nearest whole share) with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the issuance date) equal to the amount of those taxes (the "Share Withholding Method"); provided, however, that the amount of any shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Corporation's required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal and state tax purposes that are applicable to supplemental taxable income. Participant shall be notified in writing or electronically in the event such Share Withholding Method is no longer available.
D. Should any shares of Common Stock subject to an Award be distributed at time the Share Withholding Method is not available, then the U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and/or all applicable Foreign Taxes required to be withheld with respect to those shares shall be collected from the Participant through either of the following alternatives:
(i) the Participant's delivery of his or her separate check payable to the Corporation in the amount of such taxes, or
 
(ii) the use of the proceeds from a next-day sale of the shares issued to the Participant, provided and only if (i) such a sale is permissible under the Corporation's insider trading policies governing the sale of Common Stock, (ii) the Participant makes an irrevocable commitment, on or before the issuance of the vested shares, to effect such sale of the shares and (iii) the transaction is not otherwise deemed to constitute a prohibited loan under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
E. Any Participant who is subject to taxation in India shall be required to pay any fringe benefit or other tax payable by the Corporation (or the Parent or Subsidiary employing such Participant) as a result of or with respect to the grant, vesting or settlement of an Award under this Stock Issuance Program or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder (the "Employer Issuance Taxes") Until such time as the Corporation provides the Participant with written or electronic notice to the contrary, the Employer Issuance Taxes shall be collected through the Share Withholding Method.
F. Any Participant who is subject to taxation in the United Kingdom shall be liable for and pay all secondary Class 1 National Insurance Contributions which may be payable by the Corporation (or any Parent or Subsidiary employing or retaining or previously employing or retaining the Participant) arising in connection with the Award or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder (the "Employer Issuance NIC").

The Plan Administrator shall have full power and authority to implement one or more of the following incentive bonus programs under the Plan:

(ii) performance unit awards ("Performance Unit Awards"), and
(iii) dividend equivalent rights ("DER Awards").
A. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority under the Plan to make Cash Awards which are to vest in one or more installments over the Participant's continued Service with the Corporation or upon the attainment of specified performance goals. Each such Cash Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; that each such Award Agreement shall comply with the terms specified below.
Cash Awards.
provided however,
1. The elements of the vesting schedule applicable to each Cash Award shall be determined by the Plan Administrator and incorporated into the Award Agreement.
2. The Plan Administrator shall also have the discretionary authority, consistent with Code Section 162(m), to structure one or more Cash Awards so that those Awards shall vest upon the achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives based upon one or more Performance Goals.
3. Outstanding Cash Awards shall automatically terminate, and no cash payment or other consideration shall be due the holders of those Awards, if the performance goals or Service requirements established for the Awards are not attained or satisfied. The Plan Administrator may in its discretion waive the cancellation and termination of one or more unvested Cash Awards which would otherwise occur upon the cessation of the Participant's Service or the non-attainment of the performance objectives applicable to those Awards. Any such waiver shall result in the immediate vesting of the Participant's interest in the Cash Award as to which the waiver applies. Such wavier may be effected at any time, whether before or after the Participant's cessation of Service or the attainment or non-attainment of the applicable performance objectives. However, no vesting requirements tied to the attainment of performance goals may be waived with respect to awards which were intended, at the time those awards were granted, to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), except as otherwise provided in Section II of this Article Four.
4. Cash Awards which become due and payable following the attainment of the applicable performance goals or satisfaction of the applicable Service requirement (or the waiver of such goals or Service requirement) may be paid in (i) cash, (ii) shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the payment date or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as the Plan Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion.
B. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to make Performance Unit Awards in accordance with the terms of this Article Four. Each such Performance Unit Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; , that each such Award Agreement shall comply with the terms specified below.
Performance Unit Awards.
provided however
1. A Performance Unit shall represent a participating interest in a special bonus pool tied to the attainment of pre-established performance objectives based on one or more Performance Goals. The amount of the bonus pool may vary with the level at which the applicable performance objectives are attained, and the value of each Performance Unit which becomes due and payable upon the attained level of performance shall be determined by dividing the amount of the resulting bonus pool (if any) by the total number of Performance Units issued and outstanding at the completion of the applicable performance period.
 
2. Performance Units may also be structured to include a Service requirement which the Participant must satisfy following the attainment of the applicable performance objectives in order to vest in those Performance Units.
3. Performance Units which become due and payable following the attainment of the applicable performance objectives and the satisfaction of any applicable Service requirement may be paid in (i) cash, (ii) shares of Common Stock valued at Fair Market Value on the payment date or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion and set forth in the Award Agreement.
C. . The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to make DER Awards in accordance with the terms of this Article Four. Each such DER Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement in the form approved by the Plan Administrator; , that each Award Agreement shall comply with the terms specified below.
Dividend Equivalent Right ("DER") Awards
provided however
1. The DER Awards may be made as stand-alone awards or in tandem with other Awards made under the Plan. The term of each such DER Award shall be established by the Plan Administrator at the time of grant, but no DER Award shall have a term in excess of seven (7) years.
2. Each DER shall represent the right to receive the economic equivalent of each dividend or distribution, whether in cash, securities or other property (other than shares of Common Stock), which is made per issued and outstanding share of Common Stock during the term the DER remains outstanding. A special account shall be maintained on the books of the Corporation for each Participant to whom a DER Award is made, and that account shall be credited per DER with each such dividend or distribution made per issued and outstanding share of Common Stock during the term of that DER remains outstanding.
3. Payment of the amounts credited to such book account may be made to the Participant either concurrently with the actual dividend or distribution made per issued and outstanding share of Common Stock or may be deferred for a period specified by the Plan Administrator at the time the DER Award is initially made or designated by the Participant pursuant to a time deferral election made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A.
4. Payment may be paid in (i) cash, (ii) shares of Common Stock or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion and set forth in the Award Agreement. If payment is to be made in the form of Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock into which the cash dividend or distribution amounts are to be converted for purposes of the Participant's book account may be based on the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of conversion, a prior date or an average of the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock over a designated period, as the Plan Administrator shall determine in its sole discretion.
 
A. The Plan Administrator shall have the discretionary authority to structure one or more Awards under this Incentive Bonus Program so that those Awards shall automatically vest in whole or in part immediately prior to the effective date of an actual Change in Control transaction or upon the subsequent termination of the Participant's Service by reason of an Involuntary Termination within a designated period following the effective date of such Change in Control.
B. The Plan Administrator's authority under Paragraph A of this Section II shall also extend to any performance bonus awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), even though the automatic vesting of those awards may result in their loss of performance-based status under Code Section 162(m).
 
The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock or make a cash payment in settlement of any Award under this Incentive Bonus Program shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable income, employment and Foreign Tax withholding requirements, any employer taxes passed through to the Optionee under Article Five, Section II and any other taxes required to be collected at the time of the issuance, vesting or settlement of such Award. Accordingly, no shares shall be issued or cash payment made with respect to an outstanding Award under this Incentive Bonus Program until such all such taxes have been collected.
 
 
A. The Plan Administrator may, in its sole discretion, structure one or more Awards under the Stock Issuance or Incentive Bonus Programs so that the Participants may be provided with an election to defer the compensation associated with those Awards for federal income tax purposes. Any such deferral opportunity shall comply with all applicable requirements of Code Section 409A.
B. To the extent the Corporation maintains one or more separate non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements which allow the participants the opportunity to make notional investments of their deferred account balances in shares of Common Stock, the Plan Administrator may authorize the share reserve under the Plan to serve as the source of any shares of Common Stock that become payable under those deferred compensation arrangements. In such event, the share reserve under the Plan shall be reduced on a share-for-one share basis for each share of Common Stock issued under the Plan in settlement of the deferred compensation owed under those separate arrangements.
C. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan or any outstanding Award Agreement, to the extent any Award under this Plan may be deemed to create a deferred compensation arrangement under Section 409A of the Code, then the following limitations shall apply to such Award and the applicable Award Agreement (if not otherwise expressly provided therein):
    No shares of Common Stock or other amounts which become issuable or distributable under such Award Agreement by reason of the Participant's cessation of Service shall actually be issued or distributed to such Participant until the date of his or her Separation from Service (as determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations) or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, but in no event later than the of (i) the close of the calendar year in which such Separation from Service occurs and (ii) the fifteenth day of the third calendar month following the date of such Separation from Service.
later
    Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, shares of Common Stock or other amounts which become issuable or distributable under such Award Agreement by reason of the Participant's cessation of Service shall actually be issued or distributed to such Participant prior to the of (i) the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of the Participant's Separation from Service and (ii) the date of Participant's death, if he or she is deemed at the time of such Separation from Service to be a specified employee under Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations as determined by the Plan Administrator in accordance with consistent and uniform standards applied to all other Code Section 409A arrangements of the Corporation, and such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). The deferred shares or other distributable amount shall be issued or distributed in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh (7th) month following the date of the Participant's Separation from Service or (if earlier) the first day of the month immediately following the date the Corporation receives proof of his or her death.
earlier
 
A. The Corporation's obligation to deliver shares of Common Stock upon the issuance, exercise, vesting or settlement of an Award under the Plan shall be subject to the satisfaction of all applicable income, employment and Foreign Tax withholding requirements, and any employer taxes passed through to the Optionee pursuant to the terms of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.
B. The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, structure one or more Awards under the Plan so that all applicable federal, state, local and Foreign Taxes (including, without limitation, any employer fringe benefit or other taxes permitted to be passed through to the employee under applicable law) incurred in connection with the
 
issuance, exercise, vesting or settlement of those Awards or the issuance of shares of Common Stock thereunder shall automatically be collected by withholding, from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the issuance, exercise, vesting or settlement of such Awards or the issuance of Common Stock thereunder, the number of shares (rounded up to the nearest whole share) with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the dollar amount of those taxes. The shares of Common Stock so withheld shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan.
 
Unvested shares may, in the Plan Administrator's discretion, be held in escrow by the Corporation until the Participant's interest in such shares vests or may be issued directly to the Participant with restrictive legends on the certificates evidencing those unvested shares.
 
A. The Plan shall become effective on the Plan Effective Date.
B. The Plan shall serve as the successor to each of the Predecessor Plans, and no further option grants or unvested share issuances shall be made under the Predecessor Plans if this Plan is approved by the stockholders at the 2009 Annual Meeting. Such stockholder approval shall not affect the option grants and unvested share awards outstanding under the Predecessor Plans at the time of the 2009 Annual Meeting, and those option grants and unvested share awards shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
C. The Plan shall terminate upon the to occur of (i) April 15, 2019, (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Plan shall have been issued as fully vested shares or (iii) the termination of all outstanding Awards in connection with a Change in Control.

A. The Board shall have complete and exclusive power and authority to amend or modify the Plan in any or all respects; that stockholder approval shall be required for any amendment to the Plan which materially increases the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan (other than pursuant to Section V.E of Article One), materially increases the benefits accruing to Optionees or Participants, materially expands the class of individuals eligible to participate in the Plan, expands the types of awards which may be made under the Plan or extends the term of the Plan or to the extent such stockholder approval may otherwise required under applicable law or regulation or pursuant to the listing standards of the Stock Exchange on which the Common Stock is at the time primarily traded. However, no such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights and obligations with respect to Awards at the time outstanding under the Plan unless the Optionee or the Participant consents to such amendment or modification.

The Compensation Committee shall have the discretionary authority to adopt and implement from time to time such addenda or subplans to the Plan as it may deem necessary in order to bring the Plan into compliance with applicable laws and regulations of any foreign jurisdictions in which grants or awards are to be made under the Plan and/or to obtain favorable tax treatment in those foreign jurisdictions for the individuals to whom the grants or awards are made.

Item 5.02  Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(e)  Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On Monday, July 6, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company") approved forms of award agreements and notices for use by the Company in connection with restricted stock unit awards and stock option grants under the Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee (or by the Board or such other committee with authority to grant awards under the Plan) at the time of grant, all awards granted pursuant to the Plan will be subject to the terms of the standard form agreements summarized below, in addition to the terms set forth in the Plan. The term "Plan Administrator," as used herein, means our Board of Directors, our Compensation Committee or any other committee, to the extent each such entity is acting within the scope of its administrative authority under the Plan.
Form of Notice of Grant of Stock Option and Stock Option Agreement
Each option will have an exercise price per share determined by the Plan Administrator, but the exercise price will not be less than one hundred percent of the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date.
Each option will vest and become exercisable for twenty-five percent of the option shares upon the optionee's completion of each year of service over the four year period measured from the option grant date. Each option will automatically accelerate in full upon a change in control, unless that award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves the intrinsic value of the award and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting schedule in effect for that award.
Each option will have a maximum term of seven years. Upon cessation of service, each optionee will have a limited period of time in which to exercise his or her outstanding option to the extent exercisable for vested shares.
Form of Notice of Award of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement Time-Based Vesting
Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock on the date that unit vests. The shares in which the participant vests will be issued on the applicable vesting date, or as soon thereafter as administratively practicable, subject to the Company's collection of applicable withholding taxes.
Each restricted stock unit award will vest in accordance with one of the following two standard vesting schedules: (i) in a series of three successive equal annual installments upon the participant's completion of each successive year of active service over the three year period measured from the award date and (ii) in a series of twelve successive equal quarterly installments upon the participant's completion of each successive calendar quarter of active service over the three year period measured from the award date. Each restricted stock unit award will vest in full upon a change in control, unless that award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves the intrinsic value of the award and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting and issuance schedule in effect for that award.
 
Phantom dividend equivalents will accrue for each outstanding restricted stock unit and will be distributed to the participant (in cash or such other form as determined by the Plan administrator) at the time the vested shares to which those dividend equivalents relate are issued, subject to the Company's collection of applicable withholding taxes.
Form of Notice of Award of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement Performance-Based Vesting
The terms of each restricted stock unit with performance based vesting will be substantially similar to the terms described above for restricted stock unit awards with time-based vesting. However, instead of a time-based vesting schedule, the units will vest on the basis of the attainment of performance objectives determined by the Plan Administrator during a performance period with a duration of at least one year, as determined by the Plan Administrator.
Form of Notice of Award of Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement Non-Employee Director Deferred Issuance
Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of common stock on the date that unit vests. The shares in which the non-employee director vests will be issued on the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the date of the non-employee director's separation from service, (ii) the closing date of a change in control transaction, (iii) the date of the non-employee director's death and (iv) the date of the non-employee director's permanent disability.
Restricted stock units will vest in a series of successive equal annual, quarterly or monthly installments upon the non-employee director's completion of each successive year, quarter or month of active service measured from the award date, as determined by the Plan Administrator at the time of grant. Each restricted stock unit will vest in full upon a change in control, unless the award is assumed or otherwise continued in effect by the successor corporation or replaced with a cash incentive program which preserves the intrinsic value of the award and provides for subsequent payout of that value in accordance with the same vesting and issuance schedule in effect for the award.
Phantom dividend equivalents will accrue for each outstanding restricted stock unit and will be distributed to the non-employee director (in cash or such other form as determined by the Plan Administrator) at the time the vested shares to which those dividend equivalents relate are issued.
The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the form agreements and notices and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents, which are filed as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.8 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(b) No installment under this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option if (and to the extent) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which such installment first becomes exercisable hereunder would, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or any other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate.

(c) Should the exercisability of this option be accelerated upon a Change in Control, then this option shall qualify for favorable tax treatment as an Incentive Option only to the extent the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the Grant Date) of the Common Stock for which this option first becomes exercisable in the calendar year in which the Change in Control transaction occurs does not, when added to the aggregate value (determined as of the respective date or dates of grant) of the Common Stock or other securities for which this option or one or more other Incentive Options granted to Optionee prior to the Grant Date (whether under the Plan or any other option plan of the Corporation or any Parent or Subsidiary) first become exercisable during the same calendar year, exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate. Should the applicable One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) limitation be exceeded in the calendar year of such Change in Control, the option may nevertheless be exercised for the excess shares in such calendar year as a Non-Statutory Option.
(d) Should Optionee hold, in addition to this option, one or more other options to purchase Common Stock which become exercisable for the first time in the same calendar year as this option, then for purposes of the foregoing limitations on the exercisability of such options as Incentive Options, this option and each of those other options shall be deemed to become first exercisable in that calendar year, on the basis of the chronological order in which such options were granted, except to the extent otherwise provided under applicable law or regulation.

In no event, however, shall any fractional shares be issued. Accordingly, the total number of shares of Common Stock to be issued at the time(s) the Award vests shall, to the extent necessary, be rounded down to the next whole share in order to avoid the issuance of a fractional share, and the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued on the final vesting date of the Vesting Schedule shall equal the number of Shares granted, minus the whole number of shares of Common Stock issued on prior vesting dates.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
Teaneck, NJ  August 4, 2009  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services, today announced its second quarter 2009 financial results.
Highlights  Second Quarter 2009
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2009 rose to $776.6 million, up 13% from $685.4 million in the second quarter of 2008. GAAP net income was $141.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $103.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.50. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 19.5%. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $8.4 million and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $1.3 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.8%, above the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Earnings for the quarter included $14.1 million of pre-tax non-operating foreign currency exchange gains (net of hedge losses), or $0.04 per share, primarily resulting from favorable fluctuations in the European currencies and Indian Rupee during the period. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"Despite a fluid economic environment, we posted industry-leading revenue growth this quarter, which demonstrates the resilience of our business model and our ability to adapt to evolving client needs," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Large corporations are seeking us out to streamline global delivery, rationalize costs and create new business capabilities that significantly advance their business objectives over the short-, medium- and long-term. I am pleased that during the quarter we further solidified our leadership position in multiple industries, expanded our range of services, specifically in engineering services and industrial automation, and deepened our presence in emerging geographies such as Asia Pacific and the Middle East."
Mr. D'Souza continued: "Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we're increasing our 2009 revenue growth guidance from at least 10% to at least 11.5%. We are convinced that technology will play an integral role in the global economic recovery, and Cognizant is well positioned to capitalize on the unfolding cyclical and secular opportunities."
2009 Outlook  Third Quarter & Full Year
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We had an excellent second quarter during which we saw healthy demand and increased revenue, while maintaining our discipline of operational excellence and reinvesting in our business to enhance our competitiveness longer-term," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "The resilience of our business model, backed by our strategic decision of reinvestment, helps us provide increasing value to our customers while nurturing those trusted relationships. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet significantly with our cash, and short- and long-term investments increasing by approximately $175 million during the quarter to a total of $1.14 billion."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to
evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation expense that is recurring, and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense which is expected to be abolished during the third quarter of 2009. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

On October 15, 2009, a subsidiary of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "Cognizant"), entered into a definitive agreement (the "Agreement") with UBS AG and an affiliate thereof to acquire UBS Service Centre (India) Private Limited ("UBS ISC") for a purchase price of approximately $75 million. The purchase price will be funded from the Company's current cash reserves. UBS ISC, based in Hyderabad, India, has been a captive service provider to various UBS entities.
In connection with the Agreement, a subsidiary of the Company and UBS AG entered into a services agreement (the "Services Agreement") pursuant to which Cognizant's subsidiary will provide a range of services, including, but not limited to, business process outsourcing ("BPO"), knowledge process outsourcing ("KPO"), information technology services and remote infrastructure management services to various UBS entities. The Company expects to receive an aggregate of approximately $442 million of revenue under the Services Agreement during its five-year term. There can be no assurance that the Company will receive or recognize such amount of revenue during such period or that the Services Agreement will not be terminated prior to its expiration in accordance with its terms.
The UBS ISC currently employs approximately 2,000 associates. Their deep capabilities in wealth management, investment banking, asset management research and remote IT infrastructure management will help the Company strengthen its business and knowledge process capabilities, deepen its financial services domain knowledge, and enhance its capabilities to provide integrated services across consulting, technology and outsourcing.
Subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in December 2009.

TEANECK, N.J., November 3, 2009  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its third quarter 2009 financial results.
Highlights  Third Quarter 2009
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2009 rose to $853.5 million, up 16% from $734.7 million in the third quarter of 2008. GAAP net income was $136.6 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $112.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.48. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 19%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $11.9 million and income of $1.3 million related to the repeal of the stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.2%, above the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Earnings for the quarter included $2.9 million of net pre-tax non-operating foreign exchange losses. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We experienced strong organic growth across all industry sectors, geographies and service lines this quarter. The sequential revenue increase of $76.9 million is the largest in the history of the company," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "Our constant focus on customer service and reinvesting in our business continues to generate industry-leading results. Clients, who have come to rely on us to help them achieve operational efficiencies, are now increasingly approaching us to serve as a consultative business partner, as their industries face comprehensive upheavals from the recession, and secular shifts resulting from new technologies and other market forces."
Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2009 Outlook
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"We are delighted that, despite the ongoing weak global economic environment, we delivered strong, broad-based revenue growth during the quarter. Our long-held strategy of investing in differentiated domain, relationship and service offering capabilities is enabling us to win marquee clients as well as grow our existing relationships," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "During the quarter we remained, as always, focused on operational discipline  enabling us to quickly ramp up to meet the surge in demand, while maintaining healthy operating margins and high quality of service. In addition, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet with our cash, short- and long-term investments increasing by over $195 million during the quarter to a total of approximately $1.34 billion."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, that has been abolished during the third quarter of 2009. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Awards of Performance Unit Grants to Certain Named Executives
On December 1, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Company, after thorough evaluation, granted the following awards of performance units ("Performance Units") to certain named executive officers of the Company set forth below. The Performance Units vest upon the achievement of certain performance milestones as set forth below.
 
The above Performance Units shall be subject to attainment of certain performance milestones as well as certain continued service requirements. All or a portion of the Performance Units shall vest based upon the level of achievement of the revenue milestone set forth below (the "Performance Milestone") as follows:
(a) 0% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2010 revenue of less than $3,663,000,000.

In addition, of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone,

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
2009 Bonus Awards
On March 9, 2010, the Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company"), after thorough evaluation, determined the 2009 annual cash incentive bonuses to be awarded to the individuals who serve as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial and Operating Officer and Treasurer, President and Managing Director, Global Delivery, Chief Operating Officer, Global Client Services and Vice Chairman (the "Named Executive Officers"), in accordance with the Company's previously disclosed non-equity incentive bonus program. The table below sets forth the target 2009 bonus amount, the actual 2009 bonus amount and the percentage of the target bonus amount received by each of the Named Executive Officers.
 
 
2010 Base Salaries
The Compensation Committee also took the following actions with regard to the cash compensation of the individuals who served as the Company's Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers and approved an increase to the base salaries for the Named Executive Officers for the 2010 calendar year as compared to the 2009 calendar year. The table below sets forth the 2009 annual base salary levels of those Named Executive Officers and the annual base salary levels in effect for them for the 2010 calendar year:
 
 
2010 Bonus Program
The Compensation Committee also approved a cash bonus program for the 2010 calendar year (the "2010 Bonus Program") pursuant to the Performance-Based Award provisions of the Company's 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The 2010 Bonus Program provides cash bonus opportunities for selected executive officers of the Company, including certain of the Named Executive Officers. Each participant in the 2010 Bonus Program is assigned a target bonus, expressed as a percentage of the participant's annual base salary for the 2010 calendar year, to which they will become entitled if the applicable performance objectives are attained. The table below sets forth the applicable percentages for the Company's Named Executive Officers under the 2010 Bonus Program.
 
 
 
The performance period for the 2010 Bonus Program is coincidental with the 2010 calendar year and the performance objectives for such performance period are tied to the Company's performance for such period measured in terms of the following financial metrics: (i) revenue, (ii) operating income before charges for stock-based compensation and any taxes or fringe benefits incurred by the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) in settlement of stock-based awards, and (iii) days sales are outstanding. The Compensation Committee has established threshold, target and maximum levels for each metric. The actual bonus to be paid per participant will be determined on the basis of the level at which each metric is actually attained, and each metric will be measured separately in terms of actual level of attainment and appropriately weighted in order to establish the individual bonus amount per participant. To the extent any performance metric is attained at a level between two of the designated levels, the bonus amount payable with respect to that metric will be determined on the basis of straight-line interpolation between those two levels.
In addition, the Compensation Committee determined that the maximum bonus payable per participant will not exceed two times his or her target bonus amount for the 2010 Bonus Program, and in no event will the bonus paid to any participant be in such amount so as to exceed the $3 million limitation in effect per person per calendar year.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

"Against the backdrop of an improving macroeconomic environment, our first quarter results confirm that our strategy of reinvestment continues to provide the platform for industry-leading growth," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "The opportunities for further penetration within our core services market remain significant. Our investments during the downturn  in new areas including consulting and emerging markets; new solutions such as enterprise analytics; and, new technologies such as cloud and mobile computing  have left us stronger than ever before. Looking forward, we will continue to invest in new business opportunities and areas where Cognizant is underpenetrated to ensure that we remain relevant to our clients and have a robust pipeline of growth opportunities to fuel Cognizant's future growth."

"Our aggressive hiring throughout the world during the past two quarters positions us well to meet the broad demand for our services," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to April 1, 2009, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
Notes:
(a) Adjustment to exclude stock-based compensation of $13,945 from income from operations of which $3,667 was reported in cost of revenues and $10,278 was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, the repeal of the Indian fringe benefit tax, retroactive to April 1, 2009, was enacted into law. Accordingly, stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense was not recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
(b) Adjustment to exclude stock-based compensation of $11,763 and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense incurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 of $945 from income from operations of which $4,448 was reported in cost of revenues and $8,260 was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
(c) Adjustment to exclude the per share effect of stock-based compensation expense net of the related tax benefit and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, if any. The stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is a nondeductible expense since the cost is recovered from employees.

It is the purpose of this Plan to provide a means whereby Eligible Employees may purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions. It is intended to provide a further incentive for Employees to promote the best interests of the Company and to encourage stock ownership by Employees in order to participate in the Company's economic progress.
It is the intention of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the provisions of the Plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with the Code.
 
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Committee shall have authority to make rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan, and its interpretations and decisions with regard thereto shall be final and conclusive. The Committee shall have all necessary authority to communicate, from time to time, with Eligible Employees and Participants for purposes of administering the Plan, and shall notify Eligible Employees promptly of its election of the term of each forthcoming Purchase Period, if other than quarterly.
There shall be 9,000,000 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance to and purchase by Participants under the Plan. Such share reserve includes (i) the 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock previously reserved for issuance under the Plan, plus (ii) an increase of 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock approved by the Board of Directors on April 1, 2010, subject to stockholder approval at the 2010 Annual Meeting. The shares of Common Stock subject to the Plan shall be either shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company. Shares of Common Stock subject to any unexercised portion of any terminated option may again be granted under the Plan.
The purchase price per share of Common Stock sold under this Plan for any Purchase Period shall be equal to the lesser of (a) 90% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the first day of such Purchase Period, or (b) 90% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the Exercise Date of such Purchase Period.
Each Eligible Employee shall be granted an option effective on the first day of each Purchase Period to purchase a number of full shares of Common Stock. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise prior to the start date of the applicable Purchase Period and subject to the limitations set forth in this Section VI, each option granted for a Purchase Period beginning on or after January 1, 2010 shall provide the Participant with the right to purchase shares of Common Stock under this Plan with an aggregate Fair Market Value of up to $25,000 (as determined on the first day of the Purchase Period) on the related Exercise Date.
No Eligible Employee shall be permitted to purchase shares under this Plan (or under any other "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Code, of the Company) with an aggregate Fair Market Value (as determined as of the first day of the Purchase Period) in excess of $25,000 for any one calendar year within the meaning of Section 423(b)(8) of the Code.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if, as of the first day of a Purchase Period, any Eligible Employee entitled to purchase shares hereunder would be deemed for the purposes of Section 423(b) (3) of the Code to own stock (including any number of shares which such person would be entitled to purchase hereunder) possessing 5% or more of the total
 
combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company, the maximum number of shares which such person shall be entitled to purchase pursuant to the Plan shall be reduced to that number which when added to the number of shares of stock of the Company which such person is so deemed to own (excluding any number of shares which such person would be entitled to purchase hereunder), is one less than such 5%.
The Compensation Committee shall have the discretionary authority, exercisable prior to the start of any Purchase Period under the Plan, to increase or decrease the limitations to be in effect for the number of shares purchasable per Participant and in total by all Participants on each Exercise Date.
An Eligible Employee may elect to become a Participant in this Plan by completing a "Stock Purchase Agreement" form or otherwise indicating an election via electronic enrollment prior to the first day of the Purchase Period. In the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Eligible Employee shall authorize regular payroll deductions from his Compensation subject to the limitations in Section VIII below. Options granted to Eligible Employees who fail to authorize payroll deductions will automatically lapse. If a Participant's payroll deductions allow him to purchase fewer than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock to which his option entitles him, the option with respect to the shares which he does not purchase will lapse as of the last day of the Purchase Period.
The execution and delivery of the Stock Purchase Agreement as between the Participant and the Company shall be conditioned upon the compliance by the Company at such time with Federal (and any applicable state) securities laws.
An Eligible Employee may authorize payroll deductions from his Compensation for each payroll period of a specified percentage of such Compensation, not less than 1% and not more than 15%, in multiples of 1%.
The amount of payroll deduction shall be established prior to the beginning of a Purchase Period and may not be altered, except for complete discontinuance under Section XI, XIII or XIV hereunder.
For a given Purchase Period, payroll deductions shall commence on the first day of the Purchase Period and shall end on the related Exercise Date, unless sooner altered or terminated as provided in the Plan.
An Account will be established for each Participant in the Plan. Payroll deductions made under Section VIII will be credited to the individual Accounts and no interest or other earnings will be credited to a Participant's Account. The amounts collected from the Participant shall not be required to be held in any segregated account or trust fund and may be commingled with the general assets of the Company and used for general corporate purposes.
 
If, as of any Exercise Date, there is credited to the Account of a Participant an amount at least equal to the purchase price of one share of Common Stock for the current Purchase Period, as determined in Section V, the Participant shall buy and the Company shall sell at such price the largest number of whole shares of Common Stock which can be purchased with the amount in his Account, subject to the limitations set forth in Section VII.
Any balance remaining in a Participant's Account at the end of a Purchase Period will be carried forward into the Participant's Account for the following Purchase Period. However, in no event will the balance carried forward be equal to or exceed the purchase price of one share of Common Stock as determined in Section V above. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, if as of any Exercise Date the provisions of Section XV are applicable to the Purchase Period ending on such Exercise Date, and the Committee reduces the number of shares which would otherwise be purchased by Participants on such Exercise Date, the entire balance remaining credited to the Account of each Participant after the purchase of the applicable number of shares of Common Stock on such Exercise Date shall be refunded to each such Participant. No refund of an Account balance made pursuant to the Plan shall include any amount in respect of interest or other imputed earnings.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no Participant may, in any calendar year, purchase a number of shares of Common Stock under this Plan which, together with all other shares of stock of the Company and its Subsidiaries which he may be entitled to purchase in such year under all other employee stock purchase plans of the Company and its subsidiaries which meet the requirements of Section 423(b) of the Code, have an aggregate Fair Market Value (measured as of the first day of each applicable Purchase Period) in excess of $25,000. The limitation described in the preceding sentence shall be applied in a manner consistent with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code.
A Participant may withdraw from the Plan at any time prior to the Exercise Date of a Purchase Period by filing a notice of withdrawal. Upon a Participant's withdrawal, the payroll deductions shall cease for the next payroll period and the entire amount credited to his Account shall be refunded to him. Any Participant who withdraws from the Plan may again become a Participant hereunder at the start of the next Purchase Period in accordance with Section VII.
The shares of Common Stock purchased by a Participant shall, for all purposes, be deemed to have been issued and sold at the close of business on the Exercise Date. Prior to that date, none of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company shall exist with respect to such shares. Stock certificates shall be registered either in the Participant's name or jointly in the names of the Participant and his spouse, as the Participant shall designate in his Stock Purchase Agreement. Such designation may be changed at any time by filing notice thereof. Certificates representing shares of purchased Common Stock shall be delivered promptly to the Participant following issuance.
 
(a) Upon a Participant's Termination of Service for any reason other than death or voluntary termination of employment on or after attaining age 55 ("Retirement"), no payroll deduction may be made from any Compensation due him as of the date of his Termination of Service and the entire balance credited to his Account shall be automatically refunded to him.
(b) Upon a Participant's Retirement, no payroll deduction shall be made from any Compensation due him as of the date of his Retirement. Such a Participant may, prior to Retirement, elect:
(1) to have the entire amount credited to his Account as of the date of his Retirement refunded to him, or
(2) to have the entire amount credited to his Account held therein and utilized to purchase shares on the Exercise Date as provided in Section X.
(c) Upon the death of a Participant, no payroll deduction shall be made from any Compensation due him at time of death, and the entire balance in the deceased Participant's Account shall be paid to the Participant's designated beneficiary, or otherwise to his estate.
Payroll deductions shall cease during a period of absence without pay from work due to a Participant's authorized leave of absence, disability or for any other reason. If such Participant shall return to active service prior to the Exercise Date for the current Purchase Period, payroll deductions shall be resumed in accordance with his prior authorization.
If the Participant shall not return to active service prior to the Exercise Date for the current Purchase Period, the balance of his Stock Purchase Account will be used to purchase shares on the Exercise Date as provided in Section X, unless the Participant elects to withdraw from the Plan in accordance with Section XI.
In the event that on any Exercise Date the aggregate funds available for the purchase of shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section X hereof would result in purchases of shares in excess of the number of shares of Common Stock then available for purchase under the Plan, the Committee shall proportionately reduce the number of shares which would otherwise be purchased by each Participant on the Exercise Date in order to eliminate such excess, and the provisions of the second paragraph of Section X shall apply.
The right to purchase shares of Common Stock under this Plan is exercisable only by the Participant during his lifetime and is not transferable by him. If a Participant attempts to transfer his right to purchase shares under the Plan, he shall be deemed to have requested withdrawal from the Plan and the provisions of Section XI hereof shall apply with respect to such Participant.
 
Granting of an option under this Plan shall impose no obligation on an Eligible Employee to exercise such option.
Granting of an option under this Plan shall imply no right of continued employment with the Company for any Eligible Employee.
Any notice which an Eligible Employee or Participant files pursuant to this Plan shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or by mail addressed to the Committee, c/o Chief Executive Officer at Glenpointe Center West, 500 Frank W. Burr Blvd., Teaneck, NJ 07666, or such other person or location as may be specified by the Committee.
The Company shall not be required to repurchase from any Participant shares of Common Stock acquired under this Plan.
Should any change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, spin-off transaction or other change affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Company's receipt of consideration or should the value of outstanding shares of Common Stock be substantially reduced as a result of a spin-off transaction or an extraordinary dividend or distribution, then equitable adjustments shall be made by the Compensation Committee to (i) the maximum number and class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number and class of securities purchasable per Participant on any one Exercise Date, (iii) the maximum number and class of securities purchasable in total by all Participants under the Plan on any one Exercise Date and (iv) the number and class of securities and the price per share in effect under each outstanding option. The adjustments shall be made in such manner as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate and such adjustments shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Subject to any required action by the stockholders, if the Company shall be the surviving corporation in any merger, reorganization or other business combination, any option granted hereunder shall cover the securities or other property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock would have been entitled pursuant to the terms of the merger. A dissolution or liquidation of the Company or a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity shall cause every option outstanding hereunder to terminate.
 
The foregoing adjustments and the manner of application of the foregoing provisions shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Any such adjustment shall provide for the elimination of any fractional share which might otherwise become subject to an option.
The Board of Directors may, without the consent of the Participants, amend the Plan at any time, provided that no such action shall adversely affect options theretofore granted hereunder, and provided that no such action by the Board of Directors, without approval of the Company's stockholders, may:
(a) increase the total number of shares of Common Stock which may be purchased by all Participants, except as contemplated in Section XXI;
(b) change the class of Employees eligible to receive options under the Plan;
(c) decrease the minimum purchase price under Section V;
(d) extend a Purchase Period hereunder; or
(e) extend the term of the Plan.
With respect to Eligible Employees who reside or work outside the United States of America, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend the terms of the Plan with respect to such Eligible Employees in order to conform such terms with the requirements of local law.
This Plan became effective as of the Effective Date, and was approved by the stockholders on May 26, 2004. The Plan, as amended and restated effective April 1, 2010 became effective upon its adoption by the Board of Directors on such date, provided, however, that the increase in the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from 6,000,000 shares to 9,000,000 shares shall become effective only if it is approved at the Company's 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Plan shall continue in effect until all shares reserved for issuance pursuant to Article IV have been granted to Participants, unless terminated prior thereto pursuant to Section XV or XXI hereof, or pursuant to the next succeeding sentence. The Board of Directors shall have the right to terminate the Plan at any time, effective as of the next succeeding Exercise Date. In the event of the termination of the Plan, outstanding options shall not be affected, except to the extent provided in Section XV and any remaining balance credited to the Account of each Participant as of the applicable Exercise Date shall be refunded to each such Participant.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Teaneck, NJ  August 3, 2010  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services, today announced its second quarter 2010 financial results.
Highlights  Second Quarter 2010
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2010 rose to $1.105 billion, up 42% from $776.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. GAAP net income was $172.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to $141.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.59. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $14.0 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.9%, within the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Earnings for the quarter included $4.6 million, or $0.02 per share, of net non-operating foreign currency exchange losses. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"Second quarter results further substantiate the strength of the Cognizant model and the continued importance of investing in deep industry expertise, expanded geographic reach and emerging technologies," said Francisco D'Souza, President and CEO of Cognizant. "During the quarter, spending levels were very strong across clients in all our business segments and geographies. Our clients are investing again in discretionary programs to foster growth and innovation. We saw particular strength in our financial services segment, which had previously been hard hit by the global credit crisis."
2010 Outlook  Third Quarter and Full Year
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"We benefited from a surge in the initiation of discretionary projects over the past several months  in part due to pent-up demand created by the deferment of discretionary spending last year," said Gordon Coburn, Chief Financial and Operating Officer. "We remain focused on ensuring we have the infrastructure, people and processes necessary to support our strong growth while maintaining industry-leading quality and client satisfaction  and we believe we are succeeding in this goal."

These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to April 1, 2009, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 
 
 
Notes:
(a) Adjustment to exclude stock-based compensation of $13,990 from income from operations of which $3,372 was reported in cost of revenues and $10,618 was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, the repeal of the Indian fringe benefit tax, retroactive to April 1, 2009, was enacted into law. Accordingly, stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense was not recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
(b) Adjustment to exclude stock-based compensation of $27,935 from income from operations of which $7,039 was reported in cost of revenues and $20,896 was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, the repeal of the Indian fringe benefit tax, retroactive to April 1, 2009, was enacted into law. Accordingly, stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense was not recorded in the six month period ended June 30, 2010.
(c) Adjustment to exclude stock-based compensation of $8,386 and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $1,267 from income from operations of which $4,140 was reported in cost of revenues and $5,513 was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
(d) Adjustment to exclude stock-based compensation of $20,149 and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax of $2,212 from income from operations of which $8,588 was reported in cost of revenues and $13,773 was reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.
(e) Adjustment to exclude the per share effect of stock-based compensation expense net of the related tax benefit and stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, if any. The stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is a nondeductible expense since the cost is recovered from employees.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Awards of Restricted Stock Unit Grants to Certain Named Executives
On November 30, 2010, the Compensation Committee ("Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), after thorough evaluation, granted the following awards of restricted stock units ("Stock Units") to certain named executive officers of the Company set forth below.
 
The Stock Units vest in quarterly installments over three years so that the Stock Units shall be fully vested on the twelfth quarterly vesting date, which quarterly vesting date will occur on November 30, 2013; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through each applicable vesting date. The Compensation Committee approved the grant and issuance of the Stock Units pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company's 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").
Awards of Performance Unit Grants to Certain Named Executives
On November 30, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Company, after thorough evaluation, granted the following awards of performance units ("Performance Units") to certain named executive officers of the Company set forth below. The Performance Units vest upon the achievement of certain performance milestones as set forth below.
 
The above Performance Units shall be subject to attainment of certain performance milestones as well as certain continued service requirements. All or a portion of the Performance Units shall vest based upon the level of achievement of the revenue milestone set forth below (the "Performance Milestone") as follows:
(a) 0% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2011 revenue of less than $5,460,000,000.
(b) 50% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2011 revenue of $5,460,000,000.
(c) 100% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2011 revenue of $5,687,500,000.
 
(d) 200% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2011 revenue of $6,142,500,000.
Whether and to what extent the Performance Milestone has been achieved shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole and absolute discretion based upon the audited financials for the 2011 fiscal year, subject to the items for which performance goals may be adjusted pursuant to the Plan. The number of Performance Units that will vest for performance between the applicable threshold targets will be determined using straight-line interpolation, rounded down to the preceding whole number (e.g., 101.74 rounded down to 101).
In addition, of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone,
1
/3rd of such Performance Units shall be issued on the eighteen-month anniversary of the date of grant; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through such anniversary date, and the remaining
2
/3rds of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone shall be issued on the thirty-six month anniversary of the date of grant; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through such anniversary date (each such date, an "Issue Date"). For the avoidance of doubt, a grantee shall only be entitled to have Performance Units issued to him if the applicable Performance Milestone is achieved based on the schedule set forth above and the grantee remains in the service of the Company through the applicable Issue Date. The number of Performance Units which shall vest and be issued on the Issue Date which occurs on the eighteen-month anniversary of the date of grant shall be rounded down to the preceding whole number (e.g., 101.74 rounded down to 101), and the number of Performance Units which shall vest and be issued on the Issue Date which occurs on the three-year anniversary of the date of grant shall equal the aggregate number of Performance Units that vested based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone minus the whole number of Performance Units that vested upon attainment of the Performance Milestone that were issued on the previous Issue Date. In no event shall any fractional shares be issued. The Compensation Committee approved the grant and issuance of the Performance Units pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
On December 1, 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $150,000,000 of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock") over the next 12 months.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely, stock-based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock-based Indian fringe benefit tax that was repealed during the third quarter of 2009 retroactive to April 1, 2009. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The Compensation Committee also took the following actions with regard to the cash compensation of the individuals who served as the Company's Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers and approved an increase to the base salaries for the Named Executive Officers for the 2011 calendar year as compared to the 2010 calendar year. The table below sets forth the 2010 annual base salary levels of those Named Executive Officers and the annual base salary levels in effect for them for the 2011 calendar year:
 
 
 
2011 Bonus Program
The Compensation Committee also approved a cash bonus program for the 2011 calendar year (the "2011 Bonus Program") pursuant to the Performance-Based Award provisions of the Company's 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The 2011 Bonus Program provides cash bonus opportunities for selected executive officers of the Company, including the Named Executive Officers. Each participant in the 2011 Bonus Program is assigned a target bonus, expressed as a percentage of the participant's annual base salary for the 2011 calendar year, to which they will become entitled if the applicable performance objectives are attained. The table below sets forth the applicable percentages for the Company's Named Executive Officers under the 2011 Bonus Program.
 
 
The performance period for the 2011 Bonus Program is coincidental with the 2011 calendar year and the performance objectives for such performance period are tied to the Company's performance for such period measured in terms of the following financial metrics: (i) revenue, (ii) operating income before charges for stock-based compensation and any taxes or fringe benefits incurred by the Company (or any parent or subsidiary of the Company) in settlement of stock-based awards, and (iii) days sales are outstanding. The Compensation Committee has established threshold, target and maximum levels for each metric. The actual bonus to be paid per participant will be determined on the basis of the level at which each metric is actually attained, and each metric will be measured separately in terms of actual level of attainment and appropriately weighted in order to establish the individual bonus amount per participant. To the extent any performance metric is attained at a level between two of the designated levels, the bonus amount payable with respect to that metric will be determined on the basis of straight-line interpolation between those two levels.
 
In addition, the Compensation Committee determined that the maximum bonus payable per participant will not exceed two times his or her target bonus amount for the 2011 Bonus Program, and in no event will the bonus paid to any participant be in such amount so as to exceed the $3 million limitation in effect per person per calendar year.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TEANECK, N.J., May 3, 2011  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its first quarter 2011 financial results.
Highlights  First Quarter 2011

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or
implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Awards of Restricted Stock Unit Grants to Certain Named Executive Officers
On November 28, 2011, the Compensation Committee ("Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), after thorough evaluation, granted the following awards of restricted stock units ("Stock Units") to certain named executive officers of the Company set forth below.
 
The Stock Units vest in quarterly installments over three years so that the Stock Units shall be fully vested on the twelfth quarterly vesting date, which quarterly vesting date will occur on November 28, 2014; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through each applicable vesting date. The Compensation Committee approved the grant and issuance of the Stock Units pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company's 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan").
Awards of Performance Unit Grants to Certain Named Executive Officers
On November 28, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Company, after thorough evaluation, granted the following awards of performance units ("Performance Units") to certain named executive officers of the Company set forth below. The Performance Units vest upon the achievement of certain performance milestones as set forth below.
The above Performance Units shall be subject to attainment of certain performance milestones as well as certain continued service requirements. All or a portion of the Performance Units shall vest based upon the level of achievement of the revenue milestone set forth below (the "Performance Milestone") as follows:
(a) 0% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2012 revenue of less than $7,243,000,000.
(b) 50% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2012 revenue of $7,243,000,000.
(c) 100% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2012 revenue of $7,525,000,000.
(d) 200% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2012 revenue of $8,087,500,000.
Whether and to what extent the Performance Milestone has been achieved shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole and absolute discretion based upon the audited financials for the 2012 fiscal year, subject to the items for which performance goals may be adjusted pursuant to the Plan. The number of Performance Units that will vest for performance between the applicable threshold targets will be determined using straight-line interpolation, rounded down to the preceding whole number (e.g., 101.74 rounded down to 101).
In addition, of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone,
1
/3rd of such Performance Units shall be issued on the eighteen-month anniversary of the date of grant; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through such anniversary date, and the remaining
2
/3rds of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone shall be issued on the thirty-six month anniversary of the date of grant; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through such anniversary date (each such date, an "Issue Date"). For the avoidance of doubt, a grantee shall only be entitled to have Performance Units issued to him if the applicable Performance Milestone is achieved based on the schedule set forth above and the grantee remains in the
service of the Company through the applicable Issue Date. The number of Performance Units which shall vest and be issued on the Issue Date which occurs on the eighteen-month anniversary of the date of grant shall be rounded down to the preceding whole number (e.g., 101.74 rounded down to 101), and the number of Performance Units which shall vest and be issued on the Issue Date which occurs on the three-year anniversary of the date of grant shall equal the aggregate number of Performance Units that vested based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone minus the whole number of Performance Units that vested upon attainment of the Performance Milestone that were issued on the previous Issue Date. In no event shall any fractional shares be issued. The Compensation Committee approved the grant and issuance of the Performance Units pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Teaneck, NJ 07666
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TEANECK, N.J., February 8, 2012  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2011 financial results.
Highlights  Fourth Quarter 2011
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 rose to $1.66 billion, up 26.9% from $1.31 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010. GAAP net income was $240.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $206.2 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.84. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $26.0 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.1%, marginally higher than the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are very pleased, once again, to deliver industry leading revenue growth in 2011 while maintaining stable margins and investing for our long-term success," said Francisco D'Souza, CEO of Cognizant. "As a result of strong client relationships and continued investments in people, knowledge and technology, we believe that Cognizant remains uniquely positioned to help clients take advantage of the volatility in the marketplace and accomplish the dual mandates of driving costs and efficiencies in their core operations while transforming their businesses to fuel top-line growth. With business challenges driven by globalization, regulatory changes, virtualization and consolidation and a confluence of new technology architectures such as mobile, social, cloud and big data, clients are increasingly looking to a partner like Cognizant that can create new levels of business value."
Highlights  Full Year 2011

First Quarter & Full Year 2012 Outlook
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"2011 was an excellent year for us. Broad-based revenue growth of 33% and net staffing additions of 33,700 are testaments to our ability to scale and expand our operations globally while preserving our client-first culture and maintaining high levels of employee satisfaction," said Gordon Coburn, President of Cognizant. "Our fourth quarter annualized attrition rate of 10%, including our BPO/KPO practice, was quite favorable compared to the industry and is a true reflection of our status as an employer of choice."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely stock-based
compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TEANECK, N.J., May 7, 2012  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its first quarter 2012 financial results.
Highlights  First Quarter 2012
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2012 rose to $1.71 billion, up 24.8% from $1.37 billion in the first quarter of 2011. GAAP net income was $243.7 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, compared to $208.3 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.86. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.6%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $31.4 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.4%, slightly higher than the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"Due to a slower than anticipated acceleration in demand as we entered the second quarter, we are adopting a more conservative stance for the remainder of the year and revising our guidance to at least 20% revenue growth for 2012," said Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer of Cognizant. "We continue to believe that we have the right portfolio of services to sustain our industry leading growth and also meet the changing demands in the market as clients continue to grapple with their dual mandates of cost containment and innovation/business transformation."
"Our solid performance this quarter validates our strategy of continually reinvesting in our business to broaden and strengthen our service offerings," said Gordon Coburn, President. "We continue to have a healthy long-term outlook for the business. Our clients recognize that in Cognizant, they have a partner with a strong consulting oriented and industry focused front-end team combined with a best-in-class global delivery model."
2012 Outlook  Second Quarter and Full Year
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"Similar to last year, we slightly exceeded our target operating margin during the first quarter  which positions us well to absorb our annual salary increases which will impact us during the second quarter, while maintaining operating margins within our target range for the year," said Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. "In addition, we repurchased $43 million of shares under our share repurchase program during the quarter and expanded the program to $1 billion, reflecting confidence in our growth opportunities, our commitment to drive shareholder value, and our ability to generate strong cash flows."
Expansion of Share Repurchase Program
Today, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the expansion of its existing share repurchase program by $400 million, bringing the total authorization under the current repurchase program to $1 billion. To date, $423 million of shares have been repurchased under this program. In addition, Cognizant's Board has extended the expiration date for the repurchase program to December 31, 2013.
Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18. The timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by the Company's management, in its discretion, and will depend upon market conditions and other factors. The repurchases will be funded using the Company's cash on hand and cash generated from operations. The program may be extended, suspended or discontinued at any time.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors.

We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

"Net long position" shall be determined with respect to each requesting holder in accordance with the definition thereof set forth in Rule 14e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), provided that (x) for purposes of such definition, in determining such holder's "short position," the reference in such Rule to "the date the tender offer is first publicly announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to the holders of the security to be acquired" shall be the date of the relevant Stockholder Special Meeting Request (as defined in Section 2(B) of this Article I) and the reference to the "highest tender offer price or stated amount of the consideration offered for the subject security" shall refer to the closing sales price of the corporation's Class A common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (or such other primary stock exchange on which the corporation's Class A common stock then trades) on such date (or, if such date is not a trading day, the next succeeding trading day) and (y) the net long position of such holder shall be reduced by the number of shares as to which such holder does not, or will not, have the right to vote or direct the vote on the matter or matters brought at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or as to which such holder has entered into any derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares. Whether the requesting holders have complied with the requirements of this Section 2 and related provisions of the By-laws shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the corporation and the stockholders.
(B) In order for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting to be called, one or more special meeting requests (each a "Stockholder Special Meeting Request," and together, the "Stockholder Special Meeting Requests") must be signed by the Requisite Percent of record holders (or their duly authorized agents) and must be delivered to the Secretary of the corporation. The Stockholder Special Meeting Request(s) shall be delivered to the Secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation by registered mail, return receipt requested. The first date on which unrevoked valid Stockholder Special Meeting Request or Stockholder Special Meeting Requests made by holders of record having shares of Class A common stock representing in the aggregate not less than the Requisite Percent and delivered to the Secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of the first two sentences of this Section 2(B) shall be the "Request Receipt Date." Each Stockholder Special Meeting Request shall (i) set forth a statement of the specific purpose(s) of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it; (ii) bear the date of signature of each such stockholder (or duly authorized agent) signing the Stockholder Special Meeting Request; (iii) set forth (A) the name and address, as they appear in the corporation's stock ledger, of each stockholder signing such request (or on whose behalf the Stockholder Special Meeting Request is signed), (B) the class, if applicable, and the number of shares of common stock of the corporation that are owned of record and beneficially by each such stockholder and (C) include documentary evidence of such stockholder's record and
 
beneficial ownership of such stock; (iv) include a detailed description of (A) any transaction in, or arrangement, agreement, understanding or relationship with respect to, any option, warrant, convertible or exchangeable security, stock appreciation right or right similar to any of the foregoing, hedging transactions or borrowed or loaned shares, with an exercise, conversion or exchange privilege, or settlement payment or mechanism related to, any security of the corporation, or similar instrument with a value derived in whole or in part from the value of a security of the corporation, in any such case whether or not it is subject to settlement in a security of the corporation or otherwise, (B) any transaction, arrangement, agreement, proxy, understanding or relationship which included or includes an opportunity for such person, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the corporation, to receive or share in the receipt of dividends payable on any securities of the corporation separate or separable from the underlying shares, to mitigate any loss or manage any risk associated with any increase or decrease in the value of any security of the corporation or to increase or decrease the number of securities of the corporation which such person was, is or will be entitled to vote, in any case whether or not it is subject to settlement in a security of the corporation or otherwise, in each case under clauses (A) and (B) including, without limitation, any put or call arrangement, short position, borrowed shares or swap or similar arrangement and (C) any transaction, arrangement, agreement, understanding or relationship with respect to the borrowing or lending of securities of the corporation or any interest therein (in each case by, of or on behalf of such stockholder); (v) set forth all information relating to each such stockholder that must be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or is otherwise required, in each case, pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, (vi) contain the information required by Section 9 of this Article I, (vii) in the case of any nominations of persons for election to the Board at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by Section 9(B)(1) of this Article I for a stockholder notice of a nomination at an annual meeting, (viii) in the case of any business, other than the election of a director or directors, proposed to be conducted at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by Section 9 of this Article I for a stockholder notice of proposed business at an annual meeting, (ix) an agreement by the requesting stockholder(s) to notify the corporation immediately in the case of any disposition on or prior to the date of such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting of shares of common stock of the corporation held by such stockholder(s) and (x) an acknowledgement by the requesting stockholder(s) and the beneficial owner(s), if any, on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made, that any reduction in the number of shares held by such stockholder(s) below the Requisite Percent following delivery of the Special Meeting Request shall be deemed a revocation of such Special Meeting Request. Any requesting stockholder may revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation, and if, following such revocation, there are un-revoked requests from stockholders holding in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percent, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may cancel the special meeting.
(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of the corporation shall not be required to call a special meeting of stockholders if (i) the Board of Directors calls an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held not later than sixty (60) days after the Request Receipt Date; or (ii) the Special Meeting Request or the Stockholder Special Meeting Request(s) (A) is received by the Secretary of the corporation during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (B) contains an identical or substantially similar item (a "Similar Item") to an item that was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within the twelve months prior to the Request Receipt Date (and, for purposes of this clause (B) the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors); (C) relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for action by the party requesting the special meeting under applicable law; (D) was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law; or (E) does not comply with the provisions of this Section 2.
(D) Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with these By-laws and the laws of the State of Delaware. In the case of a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, such meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be not more than sixty (60) days after the record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"), which shall be fixed in accordance with Section 8 of this Article I. In fixing a date and time for any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the Board of Directors may consider such factors as it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting.
 
(E) Business to be transacted at a special meeting, including a special meeting called by a Special Meeting Request or a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, may only be brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting. Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the Stockholder Special Meeting Request(s); provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters not included in the Stockholder Special Meeting Request(s) to the stockholders at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting.
SECTION 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of the time, place and purpose or purposes of every meeting of stockholders shall be given not earlier than sixty, nor less than ten, days previous thereto to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. Notice of any meeting of stockholders need not be given to any stockholders who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing or by electronic transmission, or to any stockholder who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
SECTION 4. The holders of record of a majority in voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of the corporation, which are entitled to vote at the meeting, shall, except as otherwise provided by law, constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders. If there be no such quorum present in person or by proxy, the holders of a majority in voting power of such shares so present or represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time.
SECTION 5. (A) Meetings of the stockholders shall be presided over by the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, or, if neither is present, by a Vice President or, if no such officer is present, by a chairman to be chosen at the meeting. The Secretary of the corporation or, in his absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the chairman shall appoint a secretary. (B) The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.
SECTION 6. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting may vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock held by him which has voting power upon the matter in question at the time; but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period.
SECTION 7. At all elections of directors the voting shall be by ballot, and a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting of stockholders for which (i) the Secretary of the corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated a
 
person for election to the Board of Directors in compliance with the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Article I, Section 9(A)(2) of these By-laws and (ii) such nomination has not been withdrawn by such stockholder on or prior to the day next preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these By-laws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the corporation, or applicable law, all other questions to stockholders shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast on such questions.
SECTION 8. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (1) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting; (2) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, shall not be more than ten (10) days from the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors; and (3) in the case of any other action, shall not be more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; (2) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action of the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation in accordance with applicable law, or, if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action; and (3) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 9. (A) . (1) Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (a) pursuant to the corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (b) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record of the corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 9 is delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 9.
Annual Meetings of Stockholders
(2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (c) of paragraph (A)(1) of this Section 9, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation and any such proposed business other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the ninetieth day nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than thirty days before or more than seventy days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation). In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth: (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (i) the name, age, business address and residence address
 
of each nominee proposed in such notice, (ii) the principal occupation or employment of each such nominee, (iii) the number of shares of capital stock of the corporation that are beneficially owned by each such nominee, (iv) a statement whether each such nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such person's failure to receive the required vote for election or re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face election or reelection, an irrevocable resignation effective upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines, (v) such other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and (vi) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend the By-laws of the corporation, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, and (iv) a representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group which intends (a) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or elect the nominee and/or (b) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination. The foregoing notice requirements shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder if the stockholder has notified the corporation of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) promulgated under the Exchange Act and such stockholder's proposal has been included in a proxy statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting. The corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the corporation.
(3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the corporation.
B. . (1) Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to the purposes stated in the corporation's notice of meeting; provided, however, that business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to (i) the purpose(s) stated in the unrevoked valid Special Meeting Request received from stockholder(s) of record holding shares representing in the aggregate at least the Requisite Percent and (ii) any additional matters that the Board of Directors determines to include in the corporation's notice of the meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors made by a stockholder or stockholders at any special meeting shall be made only in accordance with the notice procedures and requirements set forth in Section 2 of this Article I, in the case of a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, and Section 9(B)(2) of this Article I, in the case of any other special meeting. Proposals made by a stockholder or stockholders of other business to be conducted at a special meeting may be made only in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2 of this Article I. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of this Article I or this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2 of this Article I. Any references to the Exchange Act are not intended to and shall not limit the requirements applicable to stockholder-proposed business to be considered pursuant to Section 2 of this Article I.
Special Meetings of Stockholders
 
(2) In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this Section 9 shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
C. . (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9. Except as otherwise provided by law, the chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty (a) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by clause (A)(2)(c)(iv) of this Section 9) and (b) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 9, to declare that such nomination shall be disregarded or that such proposed business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation to present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the corporation.
General
(2) For purposes of this Section 9, "public announcement" shall include disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9. Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation.
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors of the corporation shall consist of such number of directors, not less than three, as shall from time to time be fixed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. A majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Directors need not be stockholders.

SECTION 3. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the notice of call of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as may from time to time be
 
fixed by resolution of the Board and special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chief Executive Officer or Chairman, by oral, telegraphic, facsimile or written notice or notice by means of electronic transmission, duly served on or sent, given or mailed to each director not less than one day before the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after the meeting of stockholders at the same place at which such meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting in person or who shall waive notice thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing or by electronic transmission. Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of the Board of Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings (or electronic transmission or transmissions) are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or committee.
SECTION 4. The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation, which to the extent permitted by law and provided in said resolution or resolutions, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it. A majority of the members of a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of its business. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee. In the absence or disqualification of any member of any such committee or committees, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors, to act at the meeting for all purposes in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 1. The Board of Directors as soon as may be after their election held in each year shall elect officers of the corporation, including a Chief Executive Officer, one or more Vice Presidents, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The Board of Directors may also from time to time appoint such other officers (including a Chairman who shall be a member of the Board of Directors, one or more Vice Chairmen, one or more Assistant Secretaries and one or more Assistant Treasurers) as it may deem proper or may delegate to any elected officer of the corporation the power so to appoint and remove any such other officers and to prescribe their respective terms of office, authorities and duties. Any Vice President may be designated Executive, Senior, or Regional, or may be given such other designation or combination of designations.
SECTION 2. All officers of the corporation elected or appointed by the Board of Directors shall hold office until their respective successors are chosen and qualified. Any officer may be removed from office at any time either with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, or, in the case of appointed officers, by any elected officer upon whom such power of removal shall have been conferred by the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3. Each of the officers of the corporation elected or appointed by the Board of Directors shall have the powers and duties prescribed by law, by the By-laws or by the Board of Directors and, unless otherwise prescribed by the By-laws or by the Board of Directors, shall have such further powers and duties as ordinarily pertain to his office. The Chief Executive Officer shall be the Principal Executive Officer and shall have the general direction of the affairs of the corporation. Any officer, agent, or employee of the corporation may be required to give bond for the faithful discharge of his duties in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of Directors may from time to time prescribe.
SECTION 4. The corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person (a "Covered Person") made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the corporation.
 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as specifically provided in this paragraph below, the corporation shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the Board of Directors of the corporation. The corporation shall to the fullest extend not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a Covered Person in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Covered Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article III or otherwise. The corporation may indemnify, to the full extent permitted by such law, any person made or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article III is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. The indemnification provided by this Article III shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person indemnified may be entitled under by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be such director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article III or otherwise.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On July 9, 2012, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (the "Company"), the Board increased the size of the Board from eight members to nine members and appointed Michael Patsalos-Fox to the Board as a Class II Director to fill the new vacancy. Mr. Patsalos-Fox will serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held in 2014. Each class of directors now was three members.
Mr. Patsalos-Fox, age 59, is a Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company, a global senior management consulting firm ("McKinsey"). Mr. Patsalos-Fox served as a member of McKinsey's operating committee and was a leader of McKinsey's new business growth opportunities around data, analytics, and software through June 30, 2012. Mr. Patsalos-Fox held various other positions with McKinsey since 1981, including Managing Partner of the New York and New Jersey offices. He also served on McKinsey's board of directors from 1998 through 2010. From 2003 through 2009, Mr. Patsalos-Fox also served as Chairman, the Americas, for McKinsey. Mr. Patsalos-Fox received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Sydney and a Master of Business Administration degree from the International Institute of Management Development.
The Board determined that Mr. Patsalos-Fox has no relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries, either directly or indirectly, that would be inconsistent with a determination of independence under the applicable rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company, through its subsidiaries, engages in transactions with other corporations or entities whose executive officers or directors also are directors or executive officers of the Company or have an affiliation with the Company's directors or executive officers. Such transactions are conducted on an arm's-length basis. As disclosed above, Mr. Patsalos-Fox is a Senior Partner at McKinsey. The Company, in the ordinary course of business, engages in transactions with McKinsey. Since January 1, 2011, the Company paid approximately $498,400 to McKinsey for consulting services.
Mr. Patsalos-Fox shall receive compensation for serving on the Board pursuant to the Company's non-employee director compensation guidelines. On July 9, 2012, the Board approved the grant to Mr. Patsalos-Fox of an award of 2,789 deferred restricted stock units (equal in value to $160,000 as measured by the closing price of the Company's Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Common Stock") on July 9, 2012 (rounded down to the nearest whole share)), with such stock grant to vest ratably on an annual basis over three years. The vested shares issuable under the stock unit award shall be issued upon Mr. Patsalos-Fox's termination of service from the Board.
On July 9, 2012, the Board also approved the grant of stock options to purchase 10,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the "Stock Options"), at an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Class A Common Stock on July 9, 2012, effective after the close of regular trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 9, 2012, to Mr. Patsalos-Fox. The Stock Options vest in two equal annual installments, with 50% of the Stock Options vesting on the one year anniversary of the grant date and 50% of the Stock Options vesting on the two year anniversary of the grant date, so that the Stock Options will be fully vested on the two year anniversary of the grant date.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation costs, are meaningful measures for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock-based compensation expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies permitted under U.S. GAAP and the variety of award types that companies can use, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus operating margin and diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share exclude costs, namely stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and evaluating such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TEANECK, N.J., November 7, 2012  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its third quarter 2012 financial results.
Highlights  Third Quarter 2012
 
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the third quarter of 2012 rose to $1.892 billion, up 18.2% from $1.601 billion in the third quarter of 2011. GAAP net income was $276.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $227.1 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis was $0.97. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.8%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $22.3 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.0%, in line with the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"Cognizant's strong results reaffirm the acceptance of our value proposition that helps clients address the dual mandate of driving efficiency and effectiveness in their core business while investing in innovation and business transformation for long-term growth," said Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer. "Our consulting-led approach, intimate client relationships, deep domain knowledge and robust execution give us the confidence to deliver revenue growth of at least 20% in 2012."
"We are pleased that our growth was broad-based across services and geographies," said Gordon Coburn, President. "Of particular note this quarter is the performance of our newer service offerings of Consulting, Business Process Outsourcing and IT Infrastructure Services. On a combined basis, these services have been growing materially faster than company average, and this quarter comprised nearly 20% of total revenue. They will continue to be important drivers of our long-term growth as each represents a large addressable market with low penetration of the global delivery model."
2012 Outlook  Fourth Quarter and Full Year
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"Our financial model continues to allow us to deliver robust top-line growth with stable margins, while investing in our next generation of services to ensure long-term strength," said Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. "Despite the recent appreciation of the Indian Rupee, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our non-GAAP operating margin within our stated 19-20% range. Our extensive India Rupee hedge program, which now totals approximately $3.7 billion, helps mitigate the impact of such volatility on our operating margins. In addition, strong cash flows during the quarter allowed us to increase our cash and investment balances by almost $300 million to over $2.6 billion."

(a) 0% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2013 revenue of less than $8,220,000,000.
(b) 50% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2013 revenue of $8,220,000,000.
(c) 100% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2013 revenue of $8,515,000,000.
(d) 200% of the Performance Units which are awarded shall vest upon the Company's achievement of 2013 revenue of $9,175,000,000.
Whether and to what extent the Performance Milestone has been achieved shall be determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole and absolute discretion based upon the audited financials for the 2013 fiscal year, subject to the items for which performance goals may be adjusted pursuant to the Plan. The number of Performance Units that will vest for performance between the applicable threshold targets will be determined using straight-line interpolation, rounded down to the preceding whole number (e.g., 101.74 rounded down to 101).
In addition, of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone, 1/3rd of such Performance Units shall be issued on the eighteen-month anniversary of the date of grant; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through such anniversary date, and the remaining 2/3rds of the Performance Units which vest based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone shall be issued on the thirty-six month anniversary of the date of grant; provided that the grantee remains in the Company's service through such
anniversary date (each such date, an "Issue Date"). For the avoidance of doubt, a grantee shall only be entitled to have Performance Units issued to him if the applicable Performance Milestone is achieved based on the schedule set forth above and the grantee remains in the service of the Company through the applicable Issue Date. The number of Performance Units which shall vest and be issued on the Issue Date which occurs on the eighteen-month anniversary of the date of grant shall be rounded down to the preceding whole number (e.g., 101.74 rounded down to 101), and the number of Performance Units which shall vest and be issued on the Issue Date which occurs on the three-year anniversary of the date of grant shall equal the aggregate number of Performance Units that vested based upon attainment of the Performance Milestone minus the whole number of Performance Units that vested upon attainment of the Performance Milestone that were issued on the previous Issue Date. In no event shall any fractional shares be issued. The Compensation Committee approved the grant and issuance of the Performance Units pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
TEANECK, N.J., February 7, 2013  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSH), a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results.
Highlights  Fourth Quarter 2012
 
 
 
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 rose to $1.95 billion, up 17.1% from $1.66 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. GAAP net income was $278.8 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $240.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2011. Diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $0.99. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 18.3%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $27.4 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 19.7%, within the Company's targeted 19-20% range. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included at the end of this release.
"We are pleased to once again deliver industry-leading revenue growth in 2012," said Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer of Cognizant. "As we look to 2013, it is clear that secular industry shifts, new technology architectures, virtual business models and changing demographics are forcing clients to re-examine how they operate. Increasingly, clients are finding incremental levels of performance inadequate and are challenging the status quo to find ways to maintain their market leadership."
"When confronting their business challenges, clients not only look to Cognizant to help them run their operations better, but increasingly turn to us to help them run their operations differently in order to differentiate themselves in the market and drive topline growth," said Gordon Coburn, President of Cognizant. "Given our strong client relationships and our deep consulting and domain expertise, Cognizant is uniquely positioned to address clients' dual mandate of running better' and running different' from one global platform."
Highlights  Full Year 2012
 
 
 
 
Revenue for 2012 increased to $7.35 billion, up 20.0% from $6.12 billion for 2011. GAAP net income was $1.05 billion, or $3.44 per diluted share, compared to $883.6 million, or $2.85 per diluted share, for 2011. Diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis was $3.70. GAAP operating margin was 18.5%. Excluding stock-based compensation expense of $107.4 million, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.0%. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP operating results and diluted EPS are included in the table at the end of this release.
First Quarter & Full Year 2013 Outlook
Starting in 2013, our reported non-GAAP financial measures will exclude acquisition-related charges, including amortization of purchased intangibles, as well as stock-based compensation expense. This change is not reflected in our reported 2012 quarterly or annual results above, but is reflected in our 2013 non-GAAP guidance below.
The Company is providing the following guidance:
 
 
 
 
 
"Generating broad-based, industry leading growth of 20% within a tough demand environment of 2012 is a testament to the strength of our business model," said Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. "Furthermore, 2012 was a strong year of cash generation. Our cash and short-term investments balances grew by $430 million during the year, after covering over $480 million of share repurchases."

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes statements which may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include general economic conditions and the factors discussed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities law.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of Cognizant's GAAP financial measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated.
Historically, we sought to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock-based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of revenues. In 2013, we will continue to seek to manage the company to the same targeted operating margin, but will exclude acquisition-related charges, including amortization of purchased intangible assets, in addition to stock-based compensation expense, in setting our internal operating targets. Accordingly, in 2013, our aforementioned non-GAAP measures will also exclude acquisition-related charges. Management believes providing investors with an operating view consistent with how it manages the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use non-GAAP financial statements for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. Therefore, it is our belief that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provides a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations.
A limitation of using non-GAAP measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are recurring, namely stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges, including amortization of purchased intangibles. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

To supplement our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following measures defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.

Beginning with 2013, we continue to seek to manage the company to the same targeted operating margin, but we now also exclude acquisition-related charges, in addition to excluding stock-based compensation expense, in setting our internal operating targets. Acquisition-related charges include, when applicable, amortization of purchased intangible assets included in the depreciation and amortization expense line on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, external deal costs, acquisition-related retention bonuses, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, charges for impairment of acquired intangible assets and other acquisition-related costs. Our 2012 non-GAAP measures have been adjusted to reflect this
change. We believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the company provides enhanced transparency into the operating results of the company.
