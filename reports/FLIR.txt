Item 4.    
Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant
 
On May 20, 2002, FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as its independent auditors. This action was approved by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The audit reports of Andersen on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 did not contain any adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion or qualification as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the two years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the subsequent interim period through May 20, 2002, there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Andersen, would have caused them to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
 
On May 20, 2002 the Company engaged KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as its new independent auditors. The decision to change accounting firms was approved by the Company's Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the subsequent interim period through May 20, 2002, the Company did not consult with KPMG regarding the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
 
The Company has requested that Andersen furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agrees with the statements contained herein. A copy of such letter dated May 20, 2002 is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Item 5.    OTHER EVENTS
 
On June 8, 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a formal order of investigation of the Company and certain officers, directors, employees and other individuals presently and formerly associated with the Company to determine whether any violations of the federal securities laws occurred during 1998 and 1999. The investigation relates to the Company's revenue recognition policies, accounting controls, financial reports and other public disclosures during that time period.
 
Pursuant to an offer of settlement submitted by the Company, on September 30, 2002, the SEC instituted and simultaneously settled a proceeding against the Company under Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission's order, the Company agreed to the entry of an order requiring that it cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the antifraud, periodic reporting, record keeping and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws set forth in Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
 
The Commission's order states that the Company materially overstated its earnings before income taxes for each of the quarters of 1998 and 1999 as well as for fiscal year 1998, and that the Company's revenue recognition practices resulted in material misstatements and omissions in the financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as originally filed for the year ended December 31, 1998 and the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q as originally filed for each of the first three quarters of both 1998 and 1999. In 2000 and 2001, the Company restated its financial statements for 1998 and 1999. No further restatements of the Company's financial statements are required by the order, and the Company does not expect that the entry of the order will have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.October 17, 2002 announced today that net earnings for the third quarter ended September 30, 2002 increased 73% to a third quarter record $10.7 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings for the third quarter of 2001 of $6.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. Revenue increased 36% to a third quarter record $64.5 million from $47.5 million for the same period last year.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the nine months, 2002 net earnings increased 84% to $28.9 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, from $15.7 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the nine months of 2001. Revenue for the nine month period increased 25% to $186.2 million from $149.4 million for the same period last year.
 
The increase in revenue for the third quarter of 2002 reflected higher sales of FLIR's imaging products, particularly its airborne and ground-based imaging systems, which increased 48% over the same period last year, and an increase in sales of the Company's thermography products, which increased 19% over the same period last year. Gross margins were 53% compared to 55% for the same period last year. Earnings from operations increased 44% to $12.8 million, or 20% of revenue, for the 2002 third quarter compared to $8.9 million, or 19% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2001.
 
"In addition to excellent revenue and earnings growth from both our Imaging and Thermography Divisions for the third quarter, we also achieved a 20 percent operating margin and generated a record $23 million in cash from operations, underscoring the strength of our balance sheet. This puts us in an excellent position as we enter the fourth quarter and 2003," said FLIR President and CEO Earl R. Lewis.
 
Announces Authorization To Repurchase Shares
 
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to 1.5 million shares of FLIR common stock from time to time in open market or private transactions at the sole discretion of management. "In the interests of building value for our shareholders, we believe that it makes sense for the Company to have the flexibility to repurchase shares whenever we see an opportunity to do so on favorable terms," Lewis said.

Increases Earnings Guidance for 2002
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
Lewis concluded, "Based on FLIR's performance during the first nine months of the year and our strong backlog, we are increasing our earnings guidance for 2002 to approximately $2.30 per diluted share. We expect revenue for the year to be approximately $260 million." In its first quarter earnings press release dated April 24, 2002, the Company provided earnings guidance for 2002 in the range of $2.20 to $2.25 per diluted share and revenue guidance in the range of $250 to $260 million.

Lewis are forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including the following: changes in demand for the Company's products, product mix, the timing of customer orders and deliveries, the impact of applicable export regulations, the impact of competitive products and pricing, constraints on supplies of critical components, excess or shortage of production capacity, actual purchases under agreements, the availability and amount of government contracts and other risks discussed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, and general domestic and international economic conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release

REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
 
In accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216, the following information is furnished pursuant to Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition."
 
On July 23, 2003, FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing (i) its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, and (ii) its expectations as to revenue and net earnings for the year ending December 31, 2003.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on July 23, 2003.
 
 

 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  July 23, 2003  announced today that revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003 increased 18% to $75.2 million from $63.6 million for the second quarter of 2002. Earnings from operations increased 34% to $15.5 million, or 21% of revenue, from $11.6 million, or 18% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2002. Net earnings for this year's second quarter increased 2% to $9.7 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, reflecting a 33% tax rate. This compares to net earnings for the second quarter of 2002 of $9.6 million, also at $0.27 per diluted share, reflecting a 15% tax rate.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
For the first half of 2003, revenue increased 19% to $144.3 million from $121.7 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first six months of 2003 increased 33% to $29.2 million, or 20% of revenue, from $22.0 million, or 18% of revenue, for the first half of 2002. Net earnings for that period increased 4% to $18.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. This compares to net earnings of $18.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2002. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on May 29, 2003.
Thermography product revenue for the second quarter increased 38% over the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher sales of the Company's new E-Series handheld cameras and favorable currency exchange rates. Imaging product revenue increased 9%, reflecting sales gains for the Company's ground-based and maritime Imaging systems.
The backlog of orders grew to approximately $119 million at June 30, 2003, as compared to $113 million at March 31, 2003. Cash generated from operations totaled $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2003. At June 30, 2003, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $204 million, which includes approximately $150 million from the placement of convertible notes and the concurrent repurchase of the Company's common stock.
"Our financial performance in the second quarter continued to demonstrate strong demand for our full range of products. I am particularly encouraged by both the increase in our backlog and the significant increase in sales of our Thermography systems. The Company is well positioned to achieve our goals for 2003 as we head into the second half, which is seasonally our strongest part of the year," said President and CEO Earl R. Lewis.

FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the first nine months of 2003, revenue increased 15% to $214.6 million from $186.1 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the 2003 period increased 35% to $47.0 million, or 22% of revenue, from $34.8 million, or 19% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2002.

Both of FLIR's business lines benefited from increased revenue and higher margins in the third quarter. In particular, the Sweden and Boston operations achieved significant margin improvement during the quarter. Thermography revenue for the 2003 quarter increased 15% over the third quarter last year, as a result of higher sales of the Company's P-Series, E-Series and new A20 handheld cameras, as well as the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. Imaging product revenue increased 5%, reflecting sales gains for the Company's airborne law enforcement and maritime Imaging systems.
 
The company's firm order backlog, defined as funded contracts for delivery within the next twelve months, grew 24% during the third quarter, to approximately $148 million at September 30, 2003, as compared to $119 million at June 30, 2003, reflecting strong order bookings in the maritime, ground and airborne segments of the Imaging business.

Earl Lewis, President and CEO, stated "I am extremely pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. In particular, I am encouraged by the increase in our backlog and the significant margin improvement during the quarter.

The Company is well positioned for an excellent fourth quarter, and to achieve our goals for the year."

The Board of Directors of
FLIR Systems, Inc.:
 
We consent to the use of our report dated May 2, 2003, with respect to the consolidated balance sheets of Indigo Systems Corporation as of February 28, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended which report appears in the Form 8-K/A of FLIR Systems, Inc. dated March 22, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
The Board of Directors
Indigo Systems Corporation:
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indigo Systems Corporation and subsidiary (the Company) as of February 28, 2003 and 2002 and the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Indigo Systems Corporation and subsidiary as of February 28, 2003 and 2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective March 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of depreciation for property and equipment.

Indigo Systems Corporation (the Company) was incorporated in the state of California in 1996 for the purpose of designing and manufacturing electro-optic and infrared cameras and components for customers and government contractors throughout the United States of America. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Indigo International Corporation, was created to facilitate foreign sales of the Company's products and services; this subsidiary was closed in fiscal 2002.
 
 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Indigo Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
 
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best available information; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
The Company recognizes revenues from product sales upon shipment. Reserves for returns and bad debts are recorded at the time of sale and revised as required. The Company also provides product development and construction services under fixed price and cost-based contracts. For fixed price contracts and cost-based contracts, revenue is recorded on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion of services rendered (cost-to-cost type of percentage-of-completion method of accounting) whereby contract costs are expensed as incurred and revenues are recorded based on the ratio of the costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion. Losses, if any, on fixed price contracts and cost-based contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss is determined. Deferred revenue represents progress payments received in advance of services rendered.
 
 
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying values of notes payable to stockholders and amounts borrowed under the Company's line of credit facilities approximate fair value due to the variable rate nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the fixed interest notes approximates fair value based on rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities.
 
 
Inventories primarily consist of optical and camera components, work in progress, and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average method.
 
 
 
 
 
Included in receivables are amounts billed and currently due from customers under all types of contracts, amounts currently due but unbilled (primarily related to contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost type of percentage-of-completion method of accounting), and amounts retained pending contract completion. Unbilled receivables on contracts represent revenues recognized on contracts for which billings had not been presented to the customer because the amounts were not contractually billable as of the balance sheet date. Unbilled accounts receivable at February 28, 2003 and 2002 were $650,524 and $15,795, respectively.
 
The Company extends credit to customers based on evaluation of the customer's financial condition and collateral is not required. The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains an allowance for anticipated losses in the consolidated financial statements.
 
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Effective March 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of depreciation of property and equipment retroactively to the straight-line method to better match revenues and related expenses and conform to predominant industry practice. Prior to March 1, 2002, the Company's method of depreciation for property and equipment was the double-declining-balance method of depreciation. The effect of this change for the year ended February 28, 2003 is a reduction of depreciation expense of $390,968. The effect of this change on years prior to fiscal 2003 was a decrease to accumulated depreciation of $413,616, net of tax, and pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, the impact was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change.
 
Property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to five years. Previously, property and equipment was depreciated over the period of five to seven years. This change in estimate was made effective on March 1, 2002. The impact to the year ended February 28, 2003 was an increase to depreciation expense of $701,229. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
 
The Company accounts for its computer software under Statement of Position 98-1 (SOP 98-1), . SOP 98-1 requires the capitalization of direct costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use, including external direct costs of materials and services and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and devote time to an internal-use software development project. Such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software's economic useful life which is the shorter of three years or the license period. At February 28, 2003 and 2002, the Company had capitalized $914,214 and $645,666, respectively, related to the purchase of internal-use software which is included in computer software in property and equipment.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
 
 
In February 1997, the Company implemented the 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan; in February 2001, the Company implemented the 2001 Incentive Stock Option and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan; and in January 2002, the Company implemented the 2002 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Plans). These Plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 (SFAS No. 123) encourages, but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. SFAS No. 123
 
 
 
 
allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, , and provides pro forma disclosure for employee stock option grants as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 as well as Interpretation No. 44, , and provides the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148, .

Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss would have been increased to the pro forma amount indicated below:
 
 
The following assumptions were used to calculate compensation cost under the minimum-value method: risk-free interest rate of 6%; no dividend yield; a weighted average expected life of an option of five years; and a nominal volatility level.
 
 
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Based upon the Company's review of the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated, there were no impairment charges during the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002.
 
 
The Company does not have any components of comprehensive loss other than net loss, and accordingly, the Company's comprehensive loss is the same as its net loss for the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002.
 
 
 
 
 
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company's cash and cash equivalents are deposited in various financial institutions and comprise demand and money market accounts and certificates of deposit with the maximum average maturity of portfolio not in excess of 90 days. (See Note 5)
 
 
Certain financial instruments potentially subject the Company to credit risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of trade accounts receivables. At February 28, 2003 and 2002, one customer accounted for approximately 28% and 9% of accounts receivable, respectively. For the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, one customer accounted for approximately 30% and 18% of total revenues, respectively.
 
 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
 
A valuation allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.
 
 
Intangible assets are comprised of capitalized license fees and costs associated with a patent. Capitalized licensing costs are costs incurred to acquire the usage of intellectual information associated with the production of infrared cameras. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortized based on a straight-line method over the shorter of the term of the license or the useful life of the intangible asset not to exceed 15 years for the license fees and 17 years for costs associated with patents. At February 28, 2003 and 2002, capitalized license costs were $1,300,000 and $600,000, respectively, and capitalized costs associated with patents were $52,075 and $36,955, receptively. Accumulated amortization of the intangible assets was $11,407 and $8,333 at February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the February 28, 2002 balances to conform to the February 28, 2003 presentation.
 
 
 
 
 
Property and equipment at February 28, 2003 and 2002 consisted of the following:
 
 
 
Inventories consist of the following at February 28, 2003 and 2002:
 
 
 
The Company has a revolving line of credit agreement with a bank. The agreement provides for borrowings of up to $10,000,000, limited to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and cash balances, and bears interest at the prime rate (4.25% at February 28, 2003). Borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of the Company's tangible assets. At February 28, 2003, no borrowings were outstanding and the Company's available borrowings on the line of credit were approximately $3,014,000. The revolving line of credit expires on September 1, 2003. The Company previously had a different line of credit which expired during the year ended February 28, 2003.
 
The Company has an equipment credit facility with a bank. This agreement provides for borrowings of up to $5,000,000 for eligible equipment purchases. Each equipment advance made under the facility bears interest at the prime rate in effect at the time of the advance plus 1.25% and is to be repaid in equal monthly installments over four years from the time of the advance. The equipment credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets and expires on September 1, 2003. Various equipment loans received under a facility with a different bank were refinanced in fiscal 2003 under the equipment credit facility.
 
The Company's revolving line of credit and equipment credit facility contain certain financial covenants concerning the Company's net worth and working capital and financial reporting requirements. The equipment credit facility also contains a covenant requiring the Company to maintain at least $5,500,000 of cash with the bank until all related obligations under the facility are repaid.
 
 
 
 
Notes payable at February 28, 2003 and 2002 consist of the following:
 
 
As of February 28, 2003, the aggregate maturities of notes payable are as follows:
 
 
 
The Company had various notes payable to stockholders totaling $236,088 as of February 28, 2002. The notes bear interest at 8% per annum and were repaid in full by the Company in fiscal 2003. Total interest expense associated with the notes payable to stockholders aggregated $4,300 and $17,000 for the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
 
 
 
 
In March 2000, the Company entered into a ten-year strategic alliance agreement with Northrup Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC) to develop manufacturing capacity for a detector product and to become a preferred supplier of the product to NGSC. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, NGSC was required to contribute to the Company $9,500,000 in cash over the initial 18 months of the agreement. As partial consideration for the $9,500,000, the Company granted 482,375 warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. The Company had a stock warrant subscription receivable in the amount of $507,877 associated with the agreement which was repaid in fiscal 2002. The agreement was amended in April 2002 to provide for an additional $1,500,000 of discretionary operating capital to the Company. As partial consideration for the $1,500,000, the Company granted an additional 38,620 stock warrants to NGSC. All warrants issued pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement have an exercise price of $0.001 and are immediately exercisable. All unexercised warrants automatically convert on a 1-to-1 basis to shares of nonvoting common stock on March 2, 2005. As of February 28, 2003, no warrants have been exercised by the holder.
 
Pursuant to the strategic alliance agreement, as amended in November 2001, for a period of ten years from the Company's initial sale of the detector products, the Company shall make periodic royalty payments equal to 5% of all detector sales. Royalty expense related to the agreement of approximately $154,000 and $153,000 was recorded as cost of revenues by the Company during the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively. All intellectual property contributed and created by the alliance will be jointly owned by both parties. The Company has accounted for the cash investments by NGSC of $11 million as an equity contribution in the accompanying financial statements. Although the Company is required to make royalty payments under this agreement, it was determined, at the time the agreement was entered into in March 2000, recovery by NGSC of their investment through royalty payments was not probable and, accordingly, no liability was recorded.
 
In conjunction with the strategic alliance agreement, NGSC is required to purchase and make available to the Company $7,500,000 of equipment over the initial 18 months of the agreement for use in detector production. Under the provisions of the equipment is not recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements because NGSC retains title. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is required to purchase or lease $4,000,000 of additional equipment. As of February 28, 2003, the Company had a remaining commitment to acquire approximately $850,000 of equipment on an as-needed basis. On occasion, the Company purchases equipment which was to be provided by NGSC under the terms of the agreement. At February 28, 2003 and 2002, the Company has a receivable from NGSC in the amount of $56,765 and $258,336, respectively, associated with equipment purchased on behalf of NGSC.

Effective in January 2002, the Company completed a recapitalization whereby all outstanding shares of common stock and options to acquire common stock under the Company's 1997 and 2001 Incentive Stock Option Plans were converted to Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A preferred) or options to acquire Series A preferred on a 1-to-1 basis. The holders of Series A preferred stock have the following rights: (1) The option to convert their preferred shares, at any time, to a new class of common stock at a conversion price of $10.75 per share; (2) The right to receive noncumulative dividends at the annual rate of $0.5375 per share, if and when declared by the board of directors; (3) Voting privileges equal to the number of common shares their preferred holdings are convertible into; and (4) Liquidation preferences in the amount of $10.75 per share. Series A
 
 
 
 
preferred stockholders will receive distributions before any distributions to common stockholders. The Series A preferred holders retained their same ownership percentages as they had with their common stock. The Company concurrently issued new common stock with 15,000,000 shares authorized and no par value.
 
In fiscal 2003, the Company repurchased 177,719 shares of Series A preferred from its stockholders for $10.75 per share, or $1,910,479.
 
 
In February 2002, the Company issued 1,252,645 shares of Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B preferred). Concurrent with the issuance of the Series B preferred, the Company issued 223,184 warrants to acquire Series B preferred for aggregate consideration of $13,937,024. During March 2002 and August 2002, the Company issued 464,082, additional shares of Series B preferred and the Company concurrently granted 206,000 warrants to acquire Series B preferred for aggregate consideration of $5,288,792. The Series B preferred is recorded as a liability reflecting its mandatory redemption provisions.
 
Under the terms of the warrant agreements, 218,914 of the warrants issued in February 2002 were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.01 per share; these warrants were exercised for Series B preferred in March 2002. The remaining warrants issued in connection with the issuance of Series B preferred have an exercise price of $0.01 and are exercisable upon the occurrence of a valuation event, as defined, within five years from issuance of the warrants which values the Company's common stock at an amount below $26.83 per share. If a qualifying valuation event occurs which values the Company's stock above $26.83 per share within five years from issuance, the warrants expire upon that event. If no qualifying valuation event occurs within five years from issuance, the warrants become fully exercisable. The warrants expire seven years from issuance.
 
The aggregate consideration received has been allocated to the Series B Preferred stock and the related warrants based upon their relative fair values. No separate valuation was done on the warrants to purchase 218,914 shares of Series B Preferred stock since these warrants were entirely unrestricted and were exercised almost concurrently with the stock issuance. Accordingly, the total consideration received was allocated to the Series B Preferred stock, aggregating 1,935,641 shares, and the warrants to purchase 210,270 shares which are contingently exercisable. The value attributed to these warrants was discounted to 25% because of the nature of the contingencies on the ultimate exercisability at the time these warrants were issued.
 
The aggregate proceeds were allocated as follows:
 
 
If elected by 66% of the then Series B preferred stockholders at any time after February 15, 2007, the Series B preferred shall be redeemable in three equal annual installments. The redemption value of the Series B preferred is $22,105,020. Accordingly, the difference between the redemption value and the allocated fair value will be accreted through February 15, 2007. The value of the accretion for the year ended February 28, 2003 was $700,000. The value of accretion for the year ended February 28, 2002 was immaterial.
 
 
 
 
Accretion is not being recorded on the value of the remaining warrants to purchase 210,270 shares of Series B Preferred stock due to the contingent nature of these warrants.
 
The recorded amounts for the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock warrants has been recorded as temporary equity in accordance with the SEC's rules and regulations.
 
In addition to the redemption feature, the stockholders of the Series B preferred have the following rights: (1) The option to convert their preferred shares, at any time, to common stock at a conversion price of $11.42 per share; (2) The right to receive noncumulative dividends at the annual rate of $0.571 per share, if and when declared by the board of directors; (3) Voting privileges equal to the number of common shares their preferred holdings are convertible into; and (4) Liquidation preferences over Series A preferred and common stockholders in the amount of $18.272 per share plus all declared but unpaid dividends. If assets available for distribution are insufficient to pay liquidation amounts in full, then the amounts payable to the holders of each class of preferred stock shall be calculated, pro rata, on the basis of each such holder's liquidation preference. All of the Company's preferred stock automatically converts to common stock upon a qualified offering, as defined, at the then effective conversion ratio. The holders of Series B preferred are permitted to elect two of the Company's five board of directors. In addition, the approval of more than 50% of the outstanding Series B preferred is required for the Company to execute certain transactions, as defined.
 
 
The Company recorded current state income tax expense related to its loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $53,889 and $800 for the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total current state income tax expense for the year ended February 28, 2003, including income tax expense associated with the cumulative effect of accounting change, was $81,558.
 
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by multiplying the statutory federal income tax rate to loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle due to the following:
 
 
During fiscal 2003, the Company decreased its valuation allowance for state tax purposes by $267,095 reflecting changes in the state impact of temporary differences.
 
 
 
 
Deferred tax assets (liabilities) consisted of the following as of February 28, 2003 and 2002:
 
 
The Company had $4,205,879 and $4,933,328 of federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards available at February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company had $2,222,912 of state income tax net operating loss carryfowards available at February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards expire starting in 2013 and 2007, respectively.
 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets; therefore, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance at February 28, 2003 and 2002.
 
During the year ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, the Company's valuation allowance increased $112,381 and $980,874 in 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
 
The Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for its employees. The plan covers employees who are at least 21 years of age and have completed two months of service with the Company. The Company matches 100% of the first 6% of qualified employee compensation contributed to the plan. Further contributions are made at the discretion of the board of directors. The Company's contribution to the plan for the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002 was $568,295 and $444,163, respectively.
 
 
Under the Company's 1997 and 2001 Incentive Stock Option Plans (1997 and 2001 Plans), options have been granted from time to time to acquire shares of Series A preferred as determined by the board of directors. The Company has ceased option grants under the 1997 and 2001 Plans subsequent to fiscal 2002. Under the Company's 2002 Incentive Stock Option Plan (2002 Plan), options can be granted from time to time for an aggregate of 359,185 options to acquire shares of common stock. The Company grants options at an exercise price at the date of grant equal to or greater than the fair value of the Company's applicable Series A preferred or common stock as determined by the board of directors. Options to purchase shares of common stock prior the January 2002 recapitalization were converted to Series A preferred on a comparable basis. The options vest over a period of five years and are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. As of February 28, 2003, there were 26,938 shares available for grant under the 2002 Plan
 
 
 
 
A summary of the combined activity of the 1997 and 2001 Plans associated with options to acquire Series A preferred is as follows:
 
 
A summary of the activity of the 2002 Plan associated with options to acquire common stock is as follows:
 
 
The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of February 28, 2003:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In September 2000, the Company entered into a license agreement to acquire the usage of patents and other intellectual information associated with production of infrared cameras. The Company is required to make royalty payments of up to 8.5% of net sales of the licensed products. No royalty payments were made by the Company in the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002. At February 28, 2003, capitalized license costs were $1,300,000. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's minimum future license fee commitment as of February 28, 2003 is as follows:
 
 
The costs of this agreement are capitalized and amortized using a method approximating the percentage of current revenues to total revenues expected to be derived from this technology. Absent the ability to predict future revenues, the Company will amortize the costs using a straight-line method over their term of the agreement.
 
The Company has operating leases primarily for the use of facilities expiring through April 2010. Substantially all operating leases are noncancelable or cancelable only by the payment of penalties. All lease payments are based on the lapse of time but include, in some cases, payments for insurance, maintenance, and property taxes. There are no purchase options on operating leases at favorable terms, but most leases have one or more renewal options. Certain leases on real property are subject to annual escalations for increases in utilities and property taxes. Lease rental expense amounted to $1,247,483 and $943,703 during the years ended February 28, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company's bank has issued letters of credit related to the Company's facility lease obligations in the amount of $500,000 as of February 28, 2003.
 
The Company leases a 21,000-square-foot production facility from a group of stockholders and executives under a lease expiring in December 2004 with minimum fixed monthly lease payments of approximately $27,000. As of February 28, 2003, total minimum fixed rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
On March 14, 2003, the Company entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with Control Systems Research, Inc. (CSR) to acquire certain assets and liabilities of the Applied Technology Division of CSR for consideration of $251,000 in cash, a promissory note in the amount of $240,912, and 27,352 shares of the Company's common stock. The promissory note bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.75% per annum and is due in ten quarterly payments of $25,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company accounted for this transaction using the purchase method. The purchase price has been principally allocated to the acquired technology.

Indigo Systems Corporation (the Company) was incorporated in the state of California in 1996 for the purpose of designing and manufacturing electro-optic and infrared cameras and components for customers and government contractors throughout the United States of America. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Indigo International Corporation, was created to facilitate foreign sales of the Company's products and services; this subsidiary was closed in fiscal 2002.
 
 
In February 1997, the Company implemented the 1997 Incentive Stock Option Plan; in February 2001, the Company implemented the 2001 Incentive Stock Option and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan; and in January 2002, the Company implemented the 2002 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the Plans). These Plans provide for the grant of incentive stock options. Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 (SFAS No. 123) encourages, but does not require, companies to record compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. SFAS No. 123 allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, , and provides pro forma disclosure for employee stock option grants as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. The Company has elected to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 as well as Interpretation No. 44, , and provides the pro forma disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148, .

Inventories consist of the following at November 30, 2003:
 
 
 
The Company has a revolving line of credit agreement with a bank which expires on September 1, 2004. The agreement provides for borrowings of up to $5,000,000, limited to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable and cash balances, and bears interest at the prime rate. As of November 30, 2003, there were no borrowings against the line of credit. Borrowings under the line of credit are secured by substantially all of the Company's tangible assets.
 
The Company has an equipment credit facility with a bank which expires on September 1, 2004. This agreement provides for borrowings of up to $5,000,000 for eligible equipment purchases. Each equipment advance made under the facility bears interest at the prime rate in effect at the time of the advance plus 1.25% and is to be repaid in equal monthly installments over four years from the time of the advance. The equipment credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.
 
The Company's revolving line of credit and equipment credit facility contained certain financial covenants concerning the Company's net worth and working capital and financial reporting requirements. The equipment credit facility also contained a covenant requiring the Company to maintain at least $5,500,000 of unrestricted cash with the bank until all related obligations under the facility are repaid.

On January 6, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of October 21, 2003 by and among FLIR Systems, Inc. ("FLIR"), Indigo Systems Corporation ("Indigo"), Fiji Sub, Inc., and William Parrish, as Shareholders' Agent, Fiji Sub, Inc. was merged with and into Indigo (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, Indigo became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLIR Systems, Inc.
 
All outstanding shares of Indigo capital stock and certain warrants outstanding immediately prior to January 6, 2004 were converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $25.3537 per share, or an aggregate of $165,478,000. Each option to purchase Indigo capital stock outstanding immediately prior to January 6, 2004 was assumed by FLIR. 709,945 shares of FLIR common stock are issuable by FLIR upon exercise of the Indigo stock options assumed by FLIR in the Merger.
 

Exhibit 99.3
 
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared to give effect to FLIR Systems Inc.'s ("FLIR") acquisition of Indigo Systems Corporation ("Indigo") on January 6, 2004 using the purchase method of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. These pro forma statements were prepared as if the Indigo acquisition had been completed as of December 31, 2003 for purposes of the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and as of January 1, 2003 for the pro forma condensed combined statement of operations.
 
FLIR's fiscal year end is December 31, whereas Indigo's fiscal year end is February 28. The following pro forma condensed combined statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2003 combines the results of operations of FLIR and of Indigo for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements include adjustments to reflect a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Indigo. The final allocation of the purchase price will be determined as more detailed analysis is completed and indemnification claims, if any, are satisfied as provided under the merger agreement. Any changes to the total purchase price paid by FLIR, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Due to the uncertainty associated with the final purchase consideration, final purchase accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented here.
 
These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based upon the respective historical consolidated financial statements of FLIR and Indigo and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of FLIR and related notes and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in FLIR's annual reports, quarterly reports and other information on file with the SEC.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and certain footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations; however, management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.
 
 
On January 6, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of October 21, 2003 by and among FLIR Systems, Inc. ("FLIR"), Indigo Systems Corporation ("Indigo"), Fiji Sub, Inc., and William Parrish, as Shareholders' Agent, Fiji Sub, Inc. was merged with and into Indigo (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, Indigo became a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLIR Systems, Inc.
 
All outstanding shares of Indigo capital stock and certain warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Merger were converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $25.3537 per share, or an aggregate of approximately $165,478,000.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on October 20, 2004.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  October 20, 2004  announced today that revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004 increased 58% to $110.8 million from $70.2 million for the third quarter of 2003. Earnings from operations increased 44% to $25.7 million, or 23% of revenue, compared with $17.8 million, or 25% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2003. Net earnings for this year's third quarter increased 55% to $16.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share compared to net earnings for the third quarter of 2003 of $10.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the first nine months of 2004, revenue increased 58% to $338.9 million from $214.6 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first nine months of 2004 increased 59% to $74.7 million, or 22% of revenue, from $47.0 million, or 22% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2003. Net earnings increased 60% to $47.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $29.7 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2003.
 
Revenue from the Company's Thermography products increased 35% over the third quarter last year, as a result of strong demand across all products and markets. Revenue from the Company's Imaging products increased 72% in the third quarter. During the quarter, airborne Imaging markets were particularly strong.
 
The backlog of orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $178 million at September 30, 2004, compared to $183 million at June 30, 2004.
 
Cash generated from operations totaled $22 million for the third quarter of 2004, and $61 million for the first nine months of 2004. At September 30, 2004, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $95 million.
 
Earl Lewis, President and CEO, stated "I am pleased with our financial performance in the third quarter. Our growth over the third quarter of last year was very strong, and we achieved solid results across all markets and product lines. As we had announced, our earnings per share were less than in the second quarter, due to seasonal factors and a slower than usual end to the government fiscal year. Nevertheless, all of our businesses are performing well, and our outlook for the business has not changed. We expect our usual strong fourth quarter results, and are thus reaffirming guidance for the full year 2004."
 
Effect of Convertible Notes on Earnings Per Share
 
In June, 2003, the Company issued $210 million of 3% Senior Convertible Notes, due 2023. The Notes are convertible into FLIR common stock at a conversion price of $44.38 per share. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company met certain requirements that allow holders of the Notes to convert their Notes into shares of FLIR common stock. As a result, the 4.7 million shares underlying the Notes have been included in the Company's diluted share count for the third quarter of 2004. Excluding the effect of the additional dilutive shares, earnings per share would have been $0.47.
 
 
FLIR Systems Announces Third Quarter 2004 Financial Results
October 20, 2004
Page Two
 
In addition, a recent accounting pronouncement that is expected to be effective in the fourth quarter of 2004 will require that the underlying shares related to the Notes be included in the Company's diluted share count retroactive to the date of issuance in June 2003. As a result, the Company anticipates restating its diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2004 for prior periods dating back to the second quarter of 2003. This pronouncement impacts only the calculation of diluted earnings per share, and has no effect on the reporting or determination of the Company's net income.
 
Based on the Company's interpretation of the new accounting rules, the impact of the restatement will be to reduce fiscal 2003 fully diluted earnings per share by $.02 to $1.25 per share, from a previously reported $1.27 per share.
 
The impact of the diluted earnings per share restatement in the first nine months of 2004 would be to reduce fully diluted earnings per share to $1.26 per share from a reported $1.30 per share.
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2004
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
Based on the Company's financial results for the first nine months of 2004, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management currently expects revenue for 2004 to be approximately $470 million to $480 million and fully diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.86. Excluding the effect of the dilutive shares related to the Notes, the new earnings per share outlook is the same as prior guidance of $1.88 to $1.98 per diluted share.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
The statements in this release by Earl R. Lewis and the statements in the Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2004 above are forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including the following: changes in demand for the Company's products, product mix, the timing of customer orders and deliveries, the impact of competitive products and pricing, the Company's continuing compliance with US export control laws and regulations, the timely receipt of export licenses for international shipments, constraints on supplies of critical components, excess or shortage of production capacity, actual purchases under agreements, the continuing eligibility of the Company to act as a federal contractor, the amount and availability of appropriated government procurement funds and other risks discussed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, and general domestic and international economic conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  December 16, 2004  today announced its preliminary financial outlook for 2005, and a two-for-one stock split.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
The company currently expects net revenue in fiscal 2005 to be in the range of $545 million to $560 million, and net earnings to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per fully diluted share.
 
Announcement of Two-For-One Stock Split
 
The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of its common stock. As a result of the stock split, shareholders will receive one additional share of common stock for every share held on the record date of January 12, 2005.
 
Upon completion of the split, the number of common shares outstanding will be approximately 78.5 million. The additional shares will be distributed on or about February 2, 2005 by the Company's transfer agent, Mellon Investor Services. This is the second time that the Company has declared a stock split.
 
Commenting on both the Company's financial outlook and the stock split, Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR, stated "I am pleased with the strong growth we have experienced in 2004, and optimistic about the future. Our outlook for 2005 reflects an expected return to more normal growth rates in our Imaging business, and continued strong growth in our Thermography business. We also expect to see improving operating margins as a result of the benefits from our acquisition of Indigo Systems earlier this year.
 
"As a result of our strong financial results to date and our current stock price, we have also decided to effect a two-for-one stock split. We believe another stock split will further our goal of making FLIR's stock attractive to the widest range of investors."

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, net earnings rose 60% to a record $71.5 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the full year 2003 of $44.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, both when adjusted for the two-for-one stock split, and the effect of the assumed conversion of the Company's convertible notes. Revenue for 2004 was $482.7 million, an increase of 55% from the $312 million generated in 2003. Revenue from the Company's Imaging division increased by 65%, while revenue from the Company's Thermography division increased by 37% compared to the prior year.
 
Cash generated from operations totaled $14.5 million for the fourth quarter and $75.1 million for 2004. At 12/31/2004 the Company had cash on hand of $120.7 million.

"2004 was another excellent year for FLIR. We achieved record revenue and net earnings as both of our divisions grew strongly. We also made progress toward many of our longer term objectives, including the integration of Indigo Systems, which was acquired last January, and the expansion of our global Thermography distribution network," commented Earl R. Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Looking to 2005, we expect growth to moderate somewhat from the very rapid pace of 2004, but remain strong. We are thus reiterating our outlook for 2005 revenue and earnings per share. Our current expectation is for full year revenue in the range of $545 to $560 million, and net earnings in the range of $1.12 to $1.18 per fully diluted share, after giving effect to the two-for-one stock split effective today. We are very proud of FLIR's accomplishments in 2004 and are excited about the prospects for 2005 and beyond," he concluded.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, OR  April 20, 2005  announced today that net earnings in its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005 increased by 16% to $14.7 million, from $12.7 million in the first quarter of 2004. Revenue for the quarter was $108.3 million, approximately unchanged from $108.9 million in the first quarter of 2004. Earnings from operations declined 3% to $21.1 million from $21.9 million for the first quarter of 2004. Net earnings per fully diluted share were $0.19, compared with $0.17 in the first quarter of 2004. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on February 2, 2005.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
Revenue from the Company's Thermography Division increased 18% over the first quarter last year, primarily due to continued strong international sales, and strong demand for the company's E-Series camera line.
 
Revenue from the Company's Imaging Division declined by 9% due to slower order activity from the US Government and delays in the receipt of export licenses to certain international customers.
 
The backlog of orders grew by 4% to approximately $165 million at March 31, 2005, as compared to $159 million at December 31, 2004.
 
Cash generated from operations totaled $12 million for the first quarter of 2005. At March 31, 2005, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million.
 
"Our financial performance in the first quarter was slightly below our internal expectations, largely as a result of slow order placement activity by the US Government and delays in receiving certain export licenses. However we expect improved order activity as the year progresses, and thus remain comfortable with our outlook for the full year" said FLIR President and CEO Earl R. Lewis. "Our current expectation for the full year 2005 is for earnings per share in the range of $1.12 to $1.18, and revenue in the range of $545 million to $560 million."

On July 21, 2005, FLIR Systems, Inc. issued a press release announcing (i) its financial results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005 and (ii) its expectations of revenue and net earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2005.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on July 21, 2005.
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 July 21, 2005  announced today that revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2005 increased 10% to $131.0 million from $119.3 million for the second quarter of 2004. Earnings from operations increased 19% to $32.3 million, or 25% of revenue, compared with $27.2 million, or 23% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2004. Net earnings for this year's second quarter increased 37% to $24.6 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the second quarter of 2004 of $17.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on February 2, 2005.
PORTLAND, Ore.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the first six months of 2005, revenue increased 5% to $239.3 million from $228.2 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first six months of 2005 increased 9% to $53.5 million, or 22% of revenue, from $49.1 million, also 22% of revenue, for the first six months of 2004. Net earnings increased 28% to $39.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $30.6 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2004.
 
Revenue from the Company's Thermography division increased 18% over the second quarter last year, as a result of continued strong demand for the company's E-Series camera line, as well as continued strength in the OEM segment.
 
Revenue from the Company's Imaging division increased 6% over the second quarter of last year, reflecting good demand for the company's large stabilized camera systems, as well as improved demand in the company's land systems business.
 
The backlog of orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $170 million at June 30, 2005, compared to $165 million at March 31, 2005.
 
Cash generated from operations totaled $19 million for the second quarter of 2005, and $31 million for the first six months of the year. At June 30, 2005, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $108 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1 million shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of approximately $25.50.
 
Earl Lewis, President and CEO, stated "After a slow start to the year, we had record orders in our Imaging business and added significantly to long term backlog in the second quarter. We launched several new products, and expanded our internal optics capability with the acquisition of Brysen Optical Corporation, a small maker of advanced optical coatings. Our Thermography Division began test marketing its newest camera series, with encouraging results. Our margins continue to improve, reflecting savings from the integration of our own detectors into our systems and improved production efficiency at our Imaging plants. We are confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2005 and are thus increasing our earnings per share guidance for the year."

On October 10, 2005, FLIR Systems, Inc. ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its preliminary expectations as to financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 and the year ending December 31, 2005. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company, and includes cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.
 
The press release issued October 10, 2005 is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report, and shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act.
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on October 10, 2005.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  October 10, 2005  today announced it expects revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 to be approximately $112 million, and net earnings per fully diluted share for the quarter to be in the range of $0.21 to $0.23. Backlog at September 30, 2005 is expected to be approximately $200 million to $205 million, an increase of $30 million to $35 million compared with the backlog at June 30, 2005. The company will announce full third quarter financial results on October 19, 2005.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
Full Year Earnings and Revenue Guidance
 
The Company also revised its full year 2005 financial outlook. Management currently expects revenue for the full year 2005 to be in the range of $510 million to $520 million, and net earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.12 to $1.17. The Company had previously announced its expectations that revenue would be in the range of $545 million to $555 million and net earnings per fully diluted share would be in the range of $1.17 to $1.22.
 
Commenting on the third quarter results and the outlook for the year, Earl Lewis, Chairman President and CEO of FLIR, stated "third quarter revenue was disappointing, due largely to lower than expected book and ship business in our Imaging division, and lower than expected European revenue in our Thermography division. Our Imaging division experienced very good bookings in the quarter, resulting in a record level of backlog. While this strong order flow supports our positive long term outlook, we do not expect to recoup the third quarter revenue and earnings shortfall in the fourth quarter, and are thus reducing our revenue and EPS outlook for the year."

On October 19, 2005, FLIR Systems, Inc. issued a press release announcing (i) its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and (ii) its expectations of revenue and net earnings per share for the year ending December 31, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PORTLAND, OR  October 19, 2005  announced today that revenue for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased 2% to $ 113.0 million from $110.8 million in the third quarter of 2004. Earnings from operations increased 3% to $26.3 million, or 23% of revenue, from $25.7 million, also 23% of revenue, for the third quarter of 2004. Net earnings for this year's third quarter increased 3% to $17.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the third quarter of 2004 of $16.8 million, also $0.22 per diluted share.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
 
For the first nine months of 2005, revenue increased 4% to $352.3 million from $338.9 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first nine months of 2005 increased 7% to $79.8 million, or 23% of revenue, from $74.7 million, or 22% of revenue, for the first nine months of 2004. Net earnings increased 19% to $56.6 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $47.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2004. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on February 2, 2005.
 
Revenue from the Company's Thermography Division increased 5% over the third quarter last year, as weakness in certain European countries offset strong growth in the Americas and Asia. Revenue from the Company's Imaging Division was virtually unchanged from the third quarter of 2004. Imaging revenue was negatively impacted by lower than expected book and ship revenue at the end of the quarter and the delay of certain orders under existing delivery contracts.
 
The backlog of orders for delivery within the next twelve months increased by 22% in the third quarter, from $170 million at June 30, 2005 to $207 million at September 30, 2005.

Cash generated from operations totaled $26 million for the third quarter of 2005, and $57 million for the first nine months of 2005. At September 30, 2005, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $134 million.
 
"Our revenue and earnings in the third quarter were disappointing, as neither of our businesses achieved their expected results." said FLIR President and CEO Earl R. Lewis. "Thermography experienced slow orders in several European countries, while Imaging experienced an imbalance of orders and production caused by lower than expected book and ship activity and a delay in certain program deliveries. Nevertheless, we are pleased with the good order intake, solid cash flow and strong margins achieved in the quarter. While we do not expect to recoup the third quarter revenue and earnings shortfall in the fourth quarter, and are thus lowering our revenue and EPS outlook for the year, we remain optimistic about the future. "
 
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2005
 
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
Based on its financial results for the first nine months of 2005, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management currently expects revenue for 2005 to be approximately $510 million to $520 million and net earnings in the range of approximately $1.12 to $1.17 per diluted share.

On April 18, 2006, FLIR Systems, Inc. ("the Company") issued a press release announcing its preliminary expectations as to financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and the year ending December 31, 2006. The press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company, and includes cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.
The press release issued April 18, 2006 is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report, and shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized on April 18, 2006.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
PORTLAND, Ore.  April 18, 2006  today announced it expects net revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 to be in the range of $117 million to $118 million, and net earnings for the quarter to be approximately $0.17 per fully diluted share. The Company's tax rate for the quarter is expected to be in the range of 28% to 29%, which is higher than expected due to the delay in re-authorization of certain federal research and development tax credits.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
Backlog at March 31, 2006 is expected to be approximately $200 million, an increase of approximately $7 million from December 31, 2005. Cash flow from operations for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $37 million. The Company will announce full first quarter results on April 26, 2006.
Full Year Earnings and Revenue Guidance
The Company also reiterated its full year 2006 financial outlook. Management currently expects net revenue for the full year 2006 to be in the range of $590 to $600 million, and net earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.30.
Commenting on the first quarter results and the outlook for the year, Earl Lewis, Chairman, President and CEO of FLIR, stated, "First quarter revenue was below our internal expectations, primarily due to delays in certain program shipments from our Boston Imaging location. During the quarter, our Thermography Division successfully launched the new InfraCam low-price thermography camera, and exceeded its operating income budget. All our Imaging Division operations with the exception of Boston were at or above budgets for operating income. We are excited by the emerging prospects for our commercial Imaging businesses and our Imaging backlog and orders remain solid. As our new products gain market acceptance, we expect a very good second half of the year."

In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, and general domestic and international economic conditions.

Exhibit 99.1
 
PORTLAND, OR  April 26, 2006  announced today that revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 increased by 8% to $117.3 million, compared with revenue of $108.3 million in the first quarter of 2005. Earnings from operations declined 11% due to the impact of expensing stock based compensation, higher selling and marketing costs related to certain new product introductions, and higher research and development expenses related to accelerated efforts on certain program developments. Net earnings per fully diluted share declined by 11% to $0.17, compared with $0.19 in the first quarter of 2005 due to the above factors and a higher than anticipated tax rate.
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
Revenue from the Company's Thermography Division increased 10% over the first quarter last year, primarily due to strong demand for InfraCAM, the Company's new low price thermal imaging camera.
Revenue from the Company's Imaging Division increased by 7% as strong sales of large airborne systems and good demand from OEM customers offset delays on certain program shipments. The backlog of funded orders for delivery within the next twelve months was $201 million at March 31, 2006, compared to $193 million at December 31, 2005.
Cash generated from operations totaled a record $34 million for the first quarter of 2006, due to strong collections following high fourth quarter 2005 revenue. At March 31, 2006, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $127 million.

Imaging Division Reorganization
The Company also announced today it has reorganized its Imaging Division into two new units, Commercial Vision Systems, and Government Systems.
The new Commercial Vision Systems Division will focus on emerging commercial markets for infrared imaging technology such as commercial security, OEMs, automotive, marine, airborne and first responder markets. Andrew C. Teich, currently co-President of the Company's Imaging Division, has been appointed President of the Commercial Vision Systems Division.
The Government Systems Division will be responsible for government end users in such applications as surveillance, force protection, border patrol, drug interdiction, search and rescue, special operations and target designation. William A. Sundermeier, currently co-President of the Company's Imaging Division, has been appointed President of the Government Systems Division.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2006
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Based on its financial results for the first quarter of 2006, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management today is reiterating its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2006. Management currently expects revenue for 2006 to be approximately $590 million to $600 million and net earnings in the range of approximately $1.20 to $1.30 per fully diluted share.
"We met our internal EPS budget in the first quarter, with the exception of delayed shipments out of Boston. However, given our strong backlog and the market response to our new products, we remain comfortable with our outlook for the year," commented Earl R. Lewis, Chairman, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. "Further, we are very excited about today's reorganization announcement and the opportunities to further grow our Imaging businesses. The Commercial and Government Imaging markets have developed distinctly different characteristics, largely as a result of our success in reducing the cost of Infrared technology. By separating these two businesses we will be able to focus on different market and product development strategies for each division," he concluded.

Exhibit 10.1
FLIR Systems, Inc.
Mr. [            ]
c/o FLIR Systems, Inc.
27700A SW Parkway Avenue
Portland, Oregon 97070
 
Dear [            ]:
FLIR Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. To this end, the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a Change of Control may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions that it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company's management to their assigned duties without distraction in circumstances arising from the possibility of a Change of Control of the Company.
To induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, this letter agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the severance benefits which the Company will provide to you in the event your employment with the Company is terminated following a Change of Control, as defined herein, under the circumstances described below.
1. . The term of this Agreement is January 1, 2006, until December 31, 2008; provided, however, that this Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days beyond the stated term if a Change of Control, as defined in Section 3 below, occurs during such term.
Term of Agreement
2. . For the purpose of this Agreement, Change of Control means a merger or consolidation to which Company is a party if the individuals and entities who were stockholders of Company immediately prior to the effective date of such merger or consolidation have beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of less than fifty percent (50%) of the total combined voting power for election of directors of
Change of Control
 
the surviving corporation immediately following the effective date of such merger or consolidation.
3. . If a Change of Control occurs during the term of this Agreement and your employment is terminated by the Company within sixty (60) days before or ninety (90) days after the Change of Control, you will be entitled to the benefits provided in Section 4 below unless such termination is (a) due to your death or Disability, or (b) for Cause. For the purpose of this Section 3, "Disability" means your inability to perform the duties of your position under this Agreement for a continuous period of five (5) months, with or without reasonable accommodation, because of a physical or mental impairment, as determined by the Board. For the purpose of this Section 3, "Cause" means you committed any one or more of the following: (i) theft, embezzlement, fraud, misappropriation of funds, other acts of dishonesty or the violation of any law or ethical rule relating to your employment by the Company; (ii) a felony or any act involving moral turpitude for which you were convicted or entered a plea of nolo contendere; (iii) a breach of any material provision of this Agreement or any confidentiality agreement between you and the Company, and if such violation or breach is susceptible of cure, the failure to effect such cure within 30 days after written notice of such breach is given to you; or (iv) a breach of your fiduciary duty to the Company.
Termination Following Change of Control
4. .
Change of Control Benefits
(a) In the event you become eligible for benefits under Section 3, all of your unvested stock options will immediately vest and become exercisable and you will fully vest in the Company's Supplemental Retirement Plan or any similar pension plan then in existence. In addition, you will receive the following benefits, conditioned upon your signing a release of claims in a form satisfactory to Company:
(i) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to two (2) times your average annual compensation received by you from the Company and includible in your gross income for federal income tax purposes for the two (2) most recent taxable years ending before the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, payable upon the later of 30 days from the date your employment terminates or the expiration of any applicable revocation period under the release, but in no event later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the termination occurs; and
(ii) until the earlier of 24 months and such time as you obtain comparable benefits through employment or otherwise, the Company will pay the COBRA premiums for continuation of group health and dental insurance coverage for you (and anyone entitled to claim under or through you).
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any payment or benefit you would receive pursuant to a Change of Control of the Company or otherwise (each a "Payment" and collectively the "Payments") could constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then the Company shall reduce the Payments so that the
 
maximum amount of the Payments shall be One Dollar ($1.00) less than the amount that would cause the Payments to be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.
(c) If a reduction in Payments is necessary under Section 4(b), reduction shall occur in the following order unless you elect in writing a different order (provided, however, that such election shall be subject to Company approval if made on or after the date on which the event that triggers the Payment occurs): reduction of cash payments; cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock awards; cancellation of accelerated vesting of Company's Supplemental Retirement Plan or any similar pension plan then in existence; and then reduction of COBRA premiums. A nationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Company shall perform the calculations required by this Agreement. The Company shall bear all reasonable expenses with respect to the determinations by such accounting firm required to be made hereunder. The accounting firm engaged to make the determinations hereunder shall provide its calculations, together with supporting documentation, to the Company and you promptly after the date on which your right to a Payment is triggered (if requested at that time by you or the Company) or such other time as requested by you or the Company, including a reasonable time prior to the Payment trigger date. Any good faith determinations of the accounting firm made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and the Company.
5. . Nothing in this Agreement modifies the at will nature of your employment with Company. Both you and the Company retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time.
Right to Terminate
6. . This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, each subsidiary and their respective successors and assigns, and shall be binding upon you, your administrators, executors, legatees, and heirs. In that this Agreement is a personal service contract, you may not assign it.
Successors and Assigns
7. . All notices, requests and demands given to or made pursuant to this Agreement shall, except as otherwise specified herein, be in writing and be delivered or mailed to any such party at its address as set forth in this Agreement. Either party may change its address, by notice to the other party given in the manner set forth in this Section. Any notice, if mailed properly addressed, postage prepaid, registered or certified mail, shall be deemed dispatched on the registered date or that stamped on the certified mail receipt, and shall be deemed received within the third business day thereafter or when it is actually received, whichever is sooner.
Notices
8. . The various headings or captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Captions
9. . In the case of any dispute arising under this Agreement which cannot be settled by reasonable discussion, the parties agree that, prior to commencing any proceeding as contemplated by Sections 10 and 11, they will first engage the services of a professional mediator agreed upon by the parties and attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute through confidential nonbinding mediation. Each party shall bear one-half (

) of the mediator's fees and expenses and shall pay all of its own attorneys' fees and expenses related to the mediation.

Construction
13. . No failure on the part of either party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy granted hereby or by any related document or by law.

Modification
15. . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written understandings, agreements, statements, representations or promises with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement was the subject of negotiation between the parties and, therefore, the parties agree that the rule of construction requiring that the agreement be construed against the drafter shall not apply to the interpretation of this Agreement.

FLIR Systems, Inc.

 July 19, 2006  announced today that revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006 increased 6% to $138.6 million from $131.0 million for the second quarter of 2005, due to higher revenue from the Company's Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems divisions. Earnings from operations decreased 10% to $29.0 million, or 21% of revenue, compared with $32.3 million, or 25% of revenue, for the second quarter of 2005. The decline in earnings from operations was attributable to lower profitability in the Company's Government Systems division, the impact of stock based compensation expense and higher selling and marketing expenses, particularly in the Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems divisions. Net earnings per fully diluted share totaled $0.28, as compared to net earnings per fully diluted share of $0.31 in the second quarter of 2005.
PORTLAND, OR
FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR)
For the first six months of 2006, revenue increased 7% to $255.9 million from $239.3 million for the same period last year. Earnings from operations for the first six months of 2006 decreased 10% to $47.9 million, or 19% of revenue, from $53.5 million, or 22% of revenue, for the first six months of 2005. Net earnings per fully diluted share for the quarter was $0.45, as compared to net earnings per fully diluted share of $0.50 per diluted share for the first six months of 2005.
Revenue from the Company's Thermography Division increased 15% over the second quarter last year, to $51.8 million, as a result of the recent introduction of several new products, including the InfraCAM and the upgraded ThermoVision E-Series camera line. During the quarter the Thermography Division also introduced the all new P-Series camera, the P640.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems Division decreased by 6% in the second quarter to $62.0 million, due in part to lower sales of land-based products in the Division's Boston facility.

Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems Division increased 25% over the second quarter of last year, to $24.8 million, reflecting strength in the automotive, maritime and OEM businesses.
The backlog of orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $173 million at June 30, 2006, compared to $201 million at March 31, 2006. Lower backlog was attributable to the order delays in the Government Systems Division, both domestically and internationally.
Cash generated from operations totaled $20 million for the second quarter of 2006, and $54 million for the first six months of the year. At June 30, 2006, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $143 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 278,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of approximately $25 per share.
Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR, stated "Overall second quarter results were consistent with our expectations. Both the Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems divisions saw continued good revenue growth and profitability growth in the quarter and the first half of the year. We expect both of these divisions to continue to do well in the second half. Government Systems Division revenue and orders were less than our expectations. We are slightly lowering our revenue expectations for the year, reflecting continued softness in Government Systems, but maintaining earnings per share guidance within our original range. We believe the long term outlook for the Government Systems business is improving, and expect faster growth in the future. Our selection by Bell as the provider of the Target Acquisition Sensor Suite for the US Army's Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program is only one of several significant program opportunities for our BRITE Star II system. Production in our Boston facility is improving, and we expect to see better results there in the second half of the year," he concluded.
Revenue and Earnings Guidance for 2006
The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Based on its financial results for the first six months of 2006, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management currently expects revenue for 2006 to be in the range of $570 million to $580 million. This compares with management's previous expectations for 2006 revenue of $590 million to $600 million. Management currently expects earnings per share for 2006 to be in the previously-announced range of $1.20 to $1.30.

On August 31, 2006 FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Company") repurchased approximately $53 million of its outstanding shares of common stock from Goldman Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs") in a private transaction in connection with an accelerated stock repurchase ("ASR") program.

PORTLAND, OR  August 30, 2006  FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) announced today that it has acquired approximately 4.1 million shares of its common stock since June 30, 2006 in a combination of open market purchases and a $53 million accelerated share repurchase agreement (ASR) with Goldman Sachs & Co.
Under the terms of the ASR, Goldman Sachs has delivered to FLIR approximately 2.0 million shares of its common stock, and may deliver up to an additional 142,000 shares, depending on the volume weighted average price of FLIR stock during the purchase period. The actual number of shares purchased will be determined upon completion of the ASR agreement, which will occur no later than October 30, 2006.
In addition, FLIR has purchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its common stock in the open market since June 30 at a total cost of approximately $51 million. The Company does not expect the repurchases to have a material impact on earnings per share for the full year 2006.
"Our recent shares repurchase activity, including the ASR, reflect continued confidence in FLIR's prospects for the future. By combining the ASR with open market purchases we achieved an optimal balance between speed, certainty of execution and cost," commented Earl R. Lewis, Chairman, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. "Our business generates significant free cash flow, and we believe FLIR stock at current prices represents an attractive opportunity to deploy this capital in a way that will benefit shareholders," he concluded.

On October 6, 2006, FLIR Systems, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Agreement') with a group of banks including Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A, U.S. Bank National Association and other lenders identified therein. The Agreement provides for a $300 million revolving credit facility with sublimits for multi currency borrowings, letters of credit and swingline loans. The Agreement expires on October 6, 2011. The Company has the option to request an increase in the revolving credit facility up to $150 million over the term of the Agreement. Each lender has the right, but not the obligation, to commit to all or a portion of any proposed increase.
Under the Agreement, borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the Bank of America or Eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread under/over such Eurodollar rates based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined in the Agreement.
Borrowings under the Agreement will be used for lawful corporate purposes including, but not limited to, the financing of future acquisitions, the refinancing of existing indebtedness, working capital needs, capital expenditures, and purchases of common stock of the Company.
The Agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants including limitations on indebtedness, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, dividends and stock repurchases. The Agreement also includes certain financial covenants that require, among other things, the maintenance of a total debt leverage ratio of no more than 4.0 to 1.0, the maintenance of a senior debt leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0, and the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.0. The Agreement also includes usual and customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to pay interest or principal when due, the failure to perform or observe covenants of the Agreement, insolvency or bankruptcy, change of control and certain judgment defaults. The Agreement is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.
On October 6, 2006, the Company had $56.5 million outstanding under the Agreement and had $5.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Agreement, which reduces the total available credit.
The foregoing description of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On October 6, 2006, the Company used funds borrowed under the Agreement to repay the outstanding amounts under the existing $100 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated April 28, 2004, among the Company as borrowers, and Bank of America, N.A., Union Bank of California, N.A, U.S. Bank National Association.

Section 2.15
(b) Each Domestic Borrower jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Domestic Borrowers with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations arising under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the Domestic Borrowers without preferences or distinction among them.
(c) If and to the extent that a Domestic Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations hereunder as and when due or to perform any of such Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event, the other Domestic Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation.
(d) The obligations of each Domestic Borrower under the provisions of this constitute full recourse obligations of such Domestic Borrower, enforceable against it to the full extent of its properties and assets, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other circumstances whatsoever.

Article IV
 
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, that if any Loan Party shall be required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
provided
(b) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above, each Loan Party shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer for (i) the full amount of Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the L/C Issuer and (ii) any liability (including penalties, interest
 
and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, in each case whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this subsection (c) shall be made within 30 days after the date the Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent makes a demand therefor.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the following is applicable:
(i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,
(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank" within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent shareholder" of the applicable Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or
(iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender's status for U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the Administrative Agent or the Company, as the Administrative Agent or the Company shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter,
 
such other documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Lender, as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender's entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the United States by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender's status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction. Each Lender shall promptly (i) notify the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any such claimed exemption or reduction, and (ii) take such steps as shall not be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any such jurisdiction that any Borrower make any deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender. Additionally, each of the Borrowers shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a timely fashion thereafter, such documents and forms required by any relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any jurisdiction, duly executed and completed by such Borrower, as are required to be furnished by such Lender or the Administrative Agent under such Laws in connection with any payment by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of Taxes or Other Taxes, or otherwise in connection with the Loan Documents, with respect to such jurisdiction.
 
If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.
 
If the Administrative Agent determines in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) that the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of
 
funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein to the extent available (or, in the case of a pending request for a Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Company and the Lenders may establish a mutually acceptable alternative rate).
 
(a) If any Lender or the L/C Issuer reasonably determines that as a result of any Change in Law, there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as applicable, of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Eurocurrency Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this subsection (a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which shall govern), (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender or the L/C Issuer is organized or has its Lending Office, (iii) reserve requirements utilized, as to Eurocurrency Rate Loans, in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate and (iv) the requirements of the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank reflected in the Mandatory Cost, other than as set forth below)) or the Mandatory Cost, as calculated hereunder, does not represent the cost to such Lender of complying with the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority or the European Central Bank in relation to its making, funding or maintaining of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, then from time to time upon demand of such Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer for such increased cost or reduction or, if applicable, the portion of such cost that is not represented by the Mandatory Cost.
Section 3.01
(b) If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law regarding capital adequacy affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer (or its Lending Office or holding company) has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender, the L/C Issuer or its holding company as a consequence of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration its (and its holding company's) policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's or its holding company's desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or such holding company for such reduction.
 
Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Company shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
 
(b) any failure by any Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Company or the applicable Designated Borrower;
(c) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) in a different currency from such Loan or Letter of Credit drawing; or
(d) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to ;
Section 11.13
including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Company shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Company (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to the Lenders under this , each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Base Rate used in determining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank eurodollar market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.
Section 3.05
 
(a) A certificate of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender claiming compensation under this and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods if applied consistently to all similarly situated borrowers.
Article III
(b) Upon any Lender's making a claim for compensation under or or requiring a conversion of Loans under , the Company may replace such Lender in accordance with .
Section 3.01
3.04
Section 3.02
Section 11.13
(c) If any Loan Party is required to pay any amount to any Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this , then such Lender, the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall, at the expense of the Company, use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue, if such change in the reasonable judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
Article III
 
All of the Borrowers' obligations under this shall survive termination of the Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.
Article III
 
 
Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the Administrative Agent and each of the holders of the Obligations as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, Swap Contracts or Treasury Management Agreements, the obligations of each Guarantor (in its capacity as such) under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws or any comparable provisions of any applicable Law.

Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against any Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this until such time as the Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated.

referred to therein shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;
(iv) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Administrative Agent or any holder of Obligations as security for any of the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or
(v) any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor).
(c) With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any holder of the Obligations exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Loan Documents or any other documents relating to the Obligations, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations.
 
The obligations of each Guarantor under this shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each holder of the Obligations on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such holder of the Obligations in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any Debtor Relief Law.
Article IV
 
Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that (a) the guaranty given hereby may be enforced without the necessity of resorting to or otherwise exhausting remedies in respect of any other security or collateral interests, and without the necessity at any time of having to take recourse against the Borrowers hereunder or against any collateral securing the Obligations or otherwise, and (b) it will not assert any right to require that action first be taken against the Borrowers or any other Person (including any co-guarantor) or pursuit of any other remedy or enforcement any other right, and (c) nothing contained herein shall prevent or limit action being taken against the Borrowers hereunder, under the other Loan Documents or the other documents and agreements relating to the Obligations or, foreclosure on any security or collateral interests relating hereto or thereto, or the exercise of any other rights or remedies available in respect thereof, if neither the Borrowers nor the Guarantors shall timely perform their obligations, and the exercise of any such rights and completion of any such foreclosure proceedings shall not constitute a discharge of the Guarantors' obligations hereunder unless as a result thereof, the Obligations shall have been paid in full and the commitments relating thereto shall have expired or terminated, it being the purpose and intent that the Guarantors' obligations hereunder be absolute, irrevocable, independent and unconditional under all circumstances.

The Company's income tax rate for the third quarter was 18%, compared with 26% in the third quarter of 2005. During the third quarter, the Company's tax expense was reduced by $3.1 million related primarily to the recognition of deferred tax assets not recognizable in previous periods. Stock based compensation expense for the third quarter of 2006 was $2.8 million, or approximately $0.03 per fully diluted share.

On March 1, 2007, FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing the findings of an independent investigation of the Company's historical stock option practices and related accounting for option grants. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
As previously disclosed, the Company has undertaken a voluntary review of its historical stock option practices and related accounting treatment as a result of the apparent issuance of options on favorable dates prior to 2000. Based upon the preliminary results of this review, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") formed a Special Committee, comprised of two outside directors, to investigate stock option grants, practices and procedures from 1995 to 2006. The Special Committee conducted its investigation with the assistance of independent legal counsel from the law firm of Perkins Coie, LLP and outside forensic accountants from Deloitte Financial Advisory Services, LLP retained by counsel.
In the course of its investigation, the Special Committee and its legal and accounting advisors reviewed approximately 135,000 documents, conducted interviews with relevant management personnel and current and former members of the Compensation Committee, and evaluated the accounting for and documentation surrounding 26.3 million options, representing 94% of options granted during the period from 1995 through 2006. With respect to stock options granted during the period from early 1995 through the middle of 2000, the Special Committee found strong circumstantial evidence of the improper selection of grant dates. With respect to stock options granted during the period from the middle of 2000 through 2006, the Special Committee identified certain procedural and corporate governance issues, but did not find any evidence that grant dates were selected based upon an attempt to seek a favorable price.
Based on the findings of its investigation, the Special Committee has concluded that pursuant to the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and other authoritative accounting literature, the grant dates for certain stock option grants made by the Company during the period 1995 to 2005 differ from the measurement dates previously used to account for such option grants. Under APB 25, the measurement date for determining compensation expense is the first date on which are known both the number of shares that an individual is entitled to receive and the option or purchase price, if any. The measurement date does not change the effective date of a grant but does determine the compensation expense, if any, required to be recognized for accounting purposes in connection with the grant.
Based on the findings of the Special Committee's investigation, subsequent internal analysis by the Company's management and discussions with the Company's independent registered public accountants, on February 26, 2007, the Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with and upon the recommendation of the Company's management, that the Company will need to restate certain of its annual historical consolidated financial statements for the period from 1995 through 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants. Accordingly, on February 26, 2007, the Audit Committee concluded that consolidated financial statements and the related audit reports of its
 
independent registered public accounting firms, and all quarterly financial statements and earnings press releases and similar communications issued by the Company relating to periods beginning on or after January 1, 1995 should no longer be relied upon. The Company has discussed this matter with KPMG LLP, the Company's current independent registered public accounting firm.
Although the Company's independent registered public accountants have not yet completed their review of the findings of the investigation and the Company has not yet determined the exact amount of the non-cash compensation charges and the resulting tax and financial accounting impacts, the Company's management and Audit Committee currently believe that the aggregate non-cash compensation charges will be approximately $14 million, excluding any tax consequences. Although the Company will restate its annual financial statements for the entire period from 1995 through 2005, the Company's management and Audit Committee believe that such impacts will be material for years 1995 through 2003 but will not be material for the years 2004 and 2005.
The Company intends to file in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 the restated information for prior periods. In that filing, the Company will summarize the final results of the investigation by the Special Committee and the review by Company's management and the impact of the primary stock compensation accounting errors underlying the final restatements. Based upon current information, the Company and Audit Committee believe the primary accounting errors are as follows:
. The grant dates used for certain stock option awards and restricted share awards between January 5, 1995 and the middle of 2000 were likely selected based upon stock price considerations, with certain dates from 1995 through 1999 likely selected in hindsight. The inaccurate use of measurement dates during this period will result in non-cash compensation charges of approximately $4 million, excluding any tax consequences, over the respective vesting periods of the various stock compensation awards.
Inaccurate measurement dates for certain stock options and restricted shares granted between January 5, 1995 and the middle of 2000
. Information obtained during the Special Committee's investigation indicated that stock options granted to officers of the Company during a scheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee on September 12, 2001 were subject to certain financial performance criteria. Because the performance results could not be determined until a subsequent date, a later measurement date should have been used. The inaccurate use of the measurement date for the September 12, 2001 option grants will result in non-cash compensation charges of approximately $3 million, excluding any tax consequences, over the periods of 2001 and 2002.
Inaccurate measurement dates for certain stock options and restricted shares granted between September 12, 2001 and December 27, 2001
On December 27, 2001 the Compensation Committee, relying on information provided to it as to the amount of shares that were available for grant under the then existing incentive stock plan, awarded stock options to officers of the Company in amounts that inadvertently exceeded the actual number of shares available under the plan. After this error was recognized, the officers voluntarily agreed to a cancellation of option grants in an amount sufficient to bring the grants in line with shares available under the plan. The date that the stock options were cancelled should have been used
 
as the measurement date. The inaccurate use of the measurement date for the December 27, 2001 option grants will result in non-cash compensation charges of approximately $6 million, not including tax consequences, over the vesting periods in 2002 and 2003.

The statements made herein are made only as of the date of this report. Except to the extent required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise.

Although the Company will restate its annual financial statements for the entire period from 1995 through 2005, the Company's management and Audit Committee believe that such impacts will be material for years 1995 through 2003 but will not be material for the years 2004 and 2005.
The Company intends to file in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 the restated information for prior periods. In that filing, the Company will summarize the final results of the investigation by the Special Committee and the review by Company's management and the impact of the primary stock compensation accounting errors underlying the final restatements. Based upon current information, the Company and Audit Committee believe the primary accounting errors are as follows:
. The grant dates used for certain stock option awards and restricted share awards between January 5, 1995 and the middle of 2000 were likely selected based upon stock price considerations, with certain dates from 1995 through 1999 likely selected in hindsight. The inaccurate use of measurement dates during this period will result in non-cash compensation charges of approximately $4 million, excluding any tax consequences, over the respective vesting periods of the various stock compensation awards.

. Information obtained during the Special Committee's investigation indicated that stock options granted to officers of the Company during a scheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee on September 12, 2001 were subject to certain financial performance criteria. Because the performance results could not be determined until a subsequent date, a later measurement date should have been used. The inaccurate use of the measurement date for the September 12, 2001 option grants will result in non-cash compensation charges of approximately $3 million, excluding any tax consequences, over the periods of 2001 and 2002.
Inaccurate measurement dates for certain stock options and restricted shares granted between September 12, 2001 and December 27, 2001
On December 27, 2001 the Compensation Committee, relying on information provided to it as to the amount of shares that were available for grant under the then existing incentive stock plan, awarded stock options to officers of the Company in amounts that inadvertently exceeded the actual number of shares available under the plan. After this error was recognized, the officers voluntarily agreed to a cancellation of option grants in an amount sufficient to bring the grants in line with shares available under the plan. The date that the stock options were cancelled should have been used as the measurement date. The inaccurate use of the measurement date for the December 27, 2001 option grants will result in non-cash compensation charges of approximately $6 million, not including tax consequences, over the vesting periods in 2002 and 2003.

9. The Board of Directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Plan; provided, however, that no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or the Option shall adversely affect the Option in any material way without the written consent of the Optionee.
10. Nothing contained in this Option shall be construed to alter the at will nature of your employment, or to limit or restrict the right of the Company or any subsidiary to or to increase or decrease your compensation from the rate of compensation in existence at the time this Option is executed.

Backlog in the Commercial Vision System's division was $54 million, up $2 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Thermography division was $11 million, flat with the prior quarter. The Thermography division operates primarily on a book and ship basis, and thus carries minimal backlog relative to revenue.

Cash used in operations during the quarter was $4 million, as net income for the quarter was offset by tax payments and increases in accounts receivable and inventory. At June 30, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $152 million, down $1 million from $153 million at March 31, 2007.
"Overall, the successful start to the year we experienced last quarter continued throughout the second quarter," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO. "Demand was excellent, particularly in our Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems divisions, as backlog at the end of the quarter again set a record at $311 million. Based on the quarter's results, and the expectations for the remainder of the year, we are once again increasing our guidance for the year."
Updated Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2007
Based on the financial results for the quarter, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company is increasing its revenue and earnings guidance for 2007. The Company currently expects net revenue in fiscal 2007 to be in the range of $730 million to $750 million, and net earnings to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.70 per diluted share, which includes stock-based compensation expense of approximately $15.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This guidance assumes a tax rate for the year of approximately 28%, and an average share count of approximately 80 million diluted shares.

Item 8.01.    Other Events
 
    On November 7, 2007, the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed for lack of standing four consolidated derivative lawsuits that were pending against certain current and former officers, directors, and employees of FLIR Systems, Inc. ("the Company"). The consolidated complaint alleged the backdating of certain stock options granted at various times between 1996 and 2001.
    As previously disclosed, in late 2006 the Company's Board of Directors ("the Board") appointed a Special Committee of outside directors to investigate the Company's historical option granting practices and related accounting treatment. The Special Committee conducted an investigation with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent forensic accountants. Following the completion of its investigation and its report to the Board, the Special Committee sought the advice and assistance of its independent legal counsel in evaluating the nature, strength, and expense of pursuing any claims based on the findings of the investigation. After its evaluation, the Special Committee recommended that the Board not pursue litigation of these claims. Based on the Special Committee's recommendation and the exercise of the Board's own business judgment, the directors voted to approve and adopt the Special Committee's recommendation.
    Another lawsuit filed on behalf of the Company in early August 2007 and raising the same issues asserted in the dismissed consolidated complaint is still pending.

quarter as a result of the reclassification of $22 million of orders related to the ARH program from current backlog to long term backlog as a result of program delays. Backlog in the Commercial Vision System's division was $68 million, up $9 million during the quarter, primarily due to strong demand in the more backlog intensive cores and components product line. Backlog in the Thermography division was $20 million, up $2 million during the quarter.
Cash provided by operations during the quarter was a record $55 million. Cash used during the quarter included $40 million for the acquisition of Extech Instruments, which closed on November 7. At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $204 million, compared with $139 million at December 31, 2006.
"We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2007 results. All three divisions once again turned in excellent performances, as our strategy of increasing demand with lower-cost infrared technology is clearly working across all of our markets," noted Earl R. Lewis, President and CEO. "With backlog exiting the year at record levels and substantial new opportunities ahead, we are introducing 2008 guidance reflecting continued strong growth across all three divisions."
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2008
FLIR also announced today that it expects net revenue in fiscal 2008 to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, and net earnings to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.20 per diluted share. This guidance assumes stable margins and includes full-year revenue and earnings estimates for the Cedip and Extech acquisitions. This guidance also assumes a tax rate for the year of approximately 30% and an average diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares.

The backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $663 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $13 million during the quarter, and an increase of $270 million, or 69% compared with backlog at December 31, 2007. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $552 million, up $5 million during the quarter, as demand remained strong across multiple product lines. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $91 million, up $10 million during the quarter due primarily to strong demand for its security and surveillance product lines. Backlog in the Thermography division was $19 million, down $3 million during the quarter.
"We are very pleased with our financial performance in 2008, as we recorded our eighth straight year of record revenue, operating income and earnings per share, and achieved the highest operating income margin and cash flow from operations in the Company's history," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO. "We are well positioned for continued growth, and each of our divisions remains focused on their core strategies. Our 2009 outlook anticipates continued growth in all three divisions, particularly our Government Systems and Commercial Vision Systems businesses, which are supported by strong backlogs. We have taken a more cautious outlook for Thermography due to expected weak economic conditions through 2009."
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2009
FLIR also announced today that it expects net revenue in fiscal 2009 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion, an increase of approximately 14% compared with 2008, and net earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.47 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 12% compared with 2008. This guidance assumes slower revenue growth in the Thermography division than originally expected as a result of continued economic weakness, and assumes a tax rate for the year of 32% to 34%, and an average diluted share count of approximately 164 million shares.

FLIR Systems Announces Second Quarter 2009 Financial Results
Operating Profit up by 31%; Earnings per Share up by 21%
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - July 23, 2009) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. Revenue was $278.0 million, up 7% compared to second quarter 2008 revenue of $261.0 million. Excluding the effects of exchange rates, revenue increased by 12% in the second quarter. Operating income in the second quarter was $84.7 million, up 31% from $64.7 million in the second quarter of 2008. Second quarter 2009 net income was $55.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with net income of $44.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the second quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $57.7 million.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 22% over the second quarter of 2008, to $160.4 million, with strength in stabilized gimbaled systems. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems division increased 4% over the second quarter of last year, to $50.8 million, reflecting growth in the cores and components markets. Revenue from the Company's Thermography division decreased 17% from the second quarter of last year, to $66.8 million, primarily due to changes in exchange rates and lower demand for high-value products for the predictive maintenance market. Excluding the effect of exchange rates, Thermography revenue decreased 9% in the quarter.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $598 million at June 30, 2009, a decrease of $19 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government System's division was $467 million, down $37 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $108 million, up $13 million during the quarter, while backlog in the Thermography division was $23 million, up $5 million during the quarter.
"We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Gross and operating margins remained at record levels, operating cash flow remained strong, and backlog in our commercial businesses increased significantly. We achieved this performance through continued solid execution in a difficult economy, as all three divisions once again improved gross and operating margins over the prior year," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2009
Based on its financial results for the first half of 2009, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR announced today that it is revising its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2009. Management currently expects revenue for 2009 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.15 billion, a reduction of $100 million compared with the previous outlook. In the first half of 2009, the effect of currency rates reduced revenue by approximately $33 million, and such effects are expected to continue in the second half. As a result of lower revenue, management has narrowed its earnings per share outlook to the low end of its previous outlook and currently expects net earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.44 per diluted share, compared with the previous outlook of $1.40 to $1.47 per diluted share.

FLIR Systems Announces Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results
Operating Earnings Increase by 17% on Record Operating Margins; Announces Acquisition of OmniTech Partners, Inc.
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - October 21, 2009) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009. Revenue was $285.6 million, up 3% compared to third quarter 2008 revenue of $276.7 million. Operating income in the third quarter was $89.3 million, up 17% from $76.7 million in the third quarter of 2008. Third quarter 2009 net income was $60.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with net income of $54.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the third quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $67.4 million.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $835.5 million, up 8% compared to revenue for the first nine months of 2008 of $774.6 million. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $257.3 million, up 31% from the same period a year ago. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $170.0 million, or $1.07 a diluted share, compared with net income of $135.9 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operations for the first nine months of 2009 was $199.4 million.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 7% over the third quarter of 2008, to $163.0 million, with strength in stabilized gimbaled systems. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems division increased 15% over the third quarter of last year, to $52.6 million, reflecting growth in the security, cores and components, and maritime markets. Revenue from the Company's Thermography division decreased 12% from the third quarter of last year, to $69.9 million, primarily due to lower demand for high-value products for the predictive maintenance market.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $608 million at September 30, 2009, an increase of $10 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government System's division was $487 million, up $20 million during the quarter due to strong U.S. demand. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $93 million, down $15 million during the quarter due to a significant order cancellation resulting from a delay in project timing. Backlog in the Thermography division was $28 million, up $5 million during the quarter.
Earnings Outlook for 2009
Based on the financial results for the quarter, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, the Company expects full year 2009 earnings per share to be slightly above the most recent outlook.
Acquisition of OmniTech Partners, Inc.
The Company announced today it has acquired OmniTech Partners, Inc., a leader in the development and manufacturing of image intensified and fused image intensified / thermal imagers based in Freeport, PA, for $42 million in cash. OmniTech adds image intensified capability to FLIR's product line, and creates the opportunity to leverage the capabilities of both companies to expand in the growing market for fused image intensified / thermal imagers. OmniTech currently forecasts annual revenue of $22 million for the year ending December 31, 2009. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to FLIR's earnings in 2009 and 2010.
"We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Operating margins were at record levels, operating cash flow was excellent, and backlog increased $20 million in our Government Systems division, improving 2010 visibility," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO. "With low cost, increasing brand awareness, and a diversified revenue base and growing product lines, the Company is executing its strategy effectively and is well positioned for future growth. I am delighted to welcome the talented people at OmniTech to the FLIR team."

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
On October 21, 2009, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the FLIR Systems, Inc. Board of Directors approved certain amendments (the "Amendments") to the FLIR Systems, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). The Amendments are designed to simplify and clarify the method of payment of benefits under the SERP, improve administrative oversight and clarify certain aspects of the SERP's operation. The Amendments are not designed to increase or decrease the benefit payable to any of the participants in the SERP.
The Amendments relate to the method for calculating a participant's minimum retirement benefit under the SERP, the administration of the plan and the elimination of certain grandfathered provisions under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). As amended, the minimum retirement benefit (the "Minimum Benefit") for plan participants who terminate employment with the Company as a result of Early Retirement, Normal Retirement, death, or Disability (all as defined in the SERP) will be equal to 118% of the lump sum present value of a hypothetical stream of installments payable annually for 20 years after the participant's retirement or termination, discounted at a rate to be determined at the time of payment, with each such installment payment equal to 25% of the greatest of:
(i) the participant's compensation received during the final 12 full months of employment (but taking into account only the most recent annual bonus payment if the participant received more than one annual bonus payment during such 12-month period),
(ii) the average of the participant's two highest full calendar years of compensation while an employee, or
(iii) the participant's highest compensation received in any one of the five full calendar years preceding Normal Retirement.
In the view of the Committee, this approach eliminates a participant's economic incentive to retire at a point in time that is not consistent with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, or the personal preferences of the participant.
The Amendments also memorialize existing practice pursuant to which the Committee is the administrator of the plan, and eliminates the grandfathering of benefits accrued and vested on or before December 31, 2004 under Section 409A of the Code, bringing all of the SERP into compliance with Section 409A.
The foregoing description of the amendments to the SERP is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the amended and restated SERP, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Specified Employee
. Eligibility for participation in the Plan shall be limited to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") and employees of the Company on its U.S. payroll who report directly to the CEO and who are nominated as eligible to participate by the CEO and approved by the Committee in its sole discretion. Individuals who are eligible shall be notified by the Company in writing as to their eligibility to participate in the Plan.
Eligible Persons
. The initial group of eligible Employees began participating in the Plan on Effective Date. Employees who became or become eligible after the Effective Date have begun, or shall begin, participation in the Plan on the date chosen by the Committee.
Commencement of Participation
. Active participation in the Plan shall end when an Employee's employment terminates for any reason. Upon termination of employment, an Employee shall remain an inactive participant in the Plan until all of the benefits to which he or she is entitled hereunder have been paid in full.
Termination of Participation
Retirement Account
A separate Account shall be established for each eligible Employee. All Accounts will be maintained on the books of the Company and the Company is under no obligation to segregate any assets to provide for the Accounts established under the Plan.
After the Effective Date, on the last day of each Plan Year, Accounts of active Employees shall be credited with an amount equal to 10% of the Employee's Compensation paid to the Employee during the Plan Year.
At the end of each calendar quarter, Employee Accounts will be credited with Account Earnings which shall be compounded quarterly. Account Earnings shall continue to be credited to the Account as long as an Employee has a positive Account balance.
Each Employee's Account as of the end of each quarter shall consist of the amounts credited under Section 3.1(b) plus Account Earnings under Section 3.1(c).
.
Account Vesting
Accounts of Employees who are younger than 50 years old upon initially becoming a Plan participant shall vest at the rate of ten percent (10%) for each full year of participation in the Plan. Vesting increases shall occur on the first day of the Plan Year following the year in which the vesting increase is earned.
Accounts of Employees who are age 50 or older upon initially becoming a Plan participant shall vest ratably over the number of years between the Employee's age at the end of the first Plan Year of participation and age 60. ( Such ratable vesting shall take into account any additional service credits received under Sections 3.2(c) or (d) below. ( Vesting increases shall occur on the first day of the Plan Year following the year in which the vesting increase is earned.< /LI>
Example: An Employee is age 56 on the last day of the first Plan Year of participation. Such Employee will vest in the Plan benefit over 4 years, with 1/4 of such vesting occurring upon completion of each year of participation in the Plan).
Example: The same Employee receives 5 years of prior service credits under Section 3.2(c) which results in an initial vesting percentage of 25%. Such Employee will achieve the remaining 75% vesting in equal increments over the following four years of participation in the Plan).
Employees with prior years of service with the Company shall receive vesting credits of 5% for each full year of prior service with the Company, to a maximum additional vesting of twenty-five percent (25%).
In its sole discretion, the Committee may grant an Employee additional vesting credits for service at a company acquired by the Company. Such prior service credits shall be granted upon entry into the Plan and shall be communicated to the Employee at that time. Additional vesting credits under this section and Section 3.2(c) shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) in total.
If an Employee terminates employment for any reason prior to Normal Retirement, death, or Disability, the Employee will forfeit the non-vested portion of his Account. Amounts forfeited under the Plan shall not be credited to Accounts of other Employees, but shall reduce the liability of the Company under the Plan.
In the event an Employee terminates employment with the Company at Normal Retirement or on account of death or Disability, the Employee shall be fully vested in his or her Account and no part of such Account may be thereafter forfeited under Section 3.2(e).
In the event of a Change of Control, all Employees shall be fully vested in their Accounts, and no amounts shall thereafter be forfeited under Section 3.2(e).
. Amounts credited to an Employee's Account may not be withdrawn or borrowed by the Employee and shall be paid to the Employee only in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.
No Withdrawal
. An Employee who terminates employment with the Company as a result of Early Retirement, Normal Retirement or within two years after a Change of Control, shall be entitled to receive payment of his or her vested Account balance, payable in a lump sum payment
Retirement Benefit
within 60 days after the date of the Employee's termination (subject to the application of Section 4.7 with respect to Specified Employees). Valuation of the Account shall occur on the last day of the month prior to the month in which the payment will occur.
.
Minimum Retirement Benefit
Employees who terminate employment with the Company as a result of Early Retirement, Normal Retirement, death, or Disability shall be entitled to receive a minimum retirement benefit equal to the greater of the amount determined under Section 4.1 or under Section 4.2(b). Such benefit shall be in lieu of the benefit determined under Section 4.1.
The minimum retirement benefit under the Plan shall be equal to one hundred eighteen percent (118%) of the lump sum present value of a hypothetical stream of installments payable annually for 20 years and commencing 60 days after the date of the Employee's retirement, death or termination due to Disability, with each such installment payment equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the greater of:
the Employee's Compensation received during the final 12 full months of employment (but taking into account only the most recent annual bonus payment if the Employee received more than one annual bonus payment during such 12-month period),
the average of the Employee's two highest full calendar years of Compensation while an employee, or
the Employee's highest Compensation received in any one of the five full calendar years preceding Normal Retirement.
All determinations of present value hereunder shall be determined solely by an actuary appointed by the Committee, based on the average of the interest rates that the actuary determines were used for purposes of calculating the premiums on three quotes, solicited by the Company and received within 60 days prior to the date of payment, for an annuity contract providing for the payment of the minimum retirement benefit in the form of a hypothetical stream of installments payable annually for 20 years and commencing 60 days after the date of the Employee's retirement, death or termination due to Disability. All such determinations shall be binding on the Company, each Employee or beneficiary, and all other persons.
For Employees who terminate as a result of Early Retirement, the amount of the hypothetical installment payments determined under Section 4.2(b) shall be reduced by six percent (6%) for each full or partial year prior to age 60 in which the termination occurs. If an Employee who is eligible for Early Retirement terminates within two (2) years after a Change of Control, the six percent (6%) benefit reduction shall not be applied and the benefit determined under this Section 4.2(d) shall be increased by 5% for each year, or partial year, by which the Employee's age at termination is less than age 60.
.

Review of Claims Denials
. The right of an Employee or any other person to the payment of any benefits under this Plan shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged or encumbered.

No Employee or any other person shall have any interest in any fund or in any specific asset or assets of the Company by reason of this Plan, or for any other reason, or have any right to receive any distributions under the Plan except as and to the extent expressly provided under the Plan. Employees are general creditors of the Company with regard to the amounts owed pursuant to the Plan.
Unfunded Plan
. This Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, its successors and assigns and each Employee and his heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives.
Binding Effect
. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as conferring upon any Employee the right to continue in the employ of the Company as an employee.
No Rights as Employee
. If the Company, Employee or a successor in interest to either of the foregoing, brings legal action to enforce any of the provisions of this Plan, the prevailing party in such legal action shall be reimbursed by the other party, the prevailing party's costs of such legal action including, without limitation, reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants and similar advisors and expert witnesses. Any reimbursement payable by the Company to an Employee pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be conditioned on the submission by the Employee of all expense reports reasonably required by the Company, and shall be paid to the Employee within 30 days following the receipt of such expense reports, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Employee incurred the reimbursable expense. Any amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during any other calendar year. The right to any reimbursement pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit.
Reimbursement of Costs
. This Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Oregon.
Applicable Law
. This Plan and any applicable enrollment forms constitute the entire understanding and agreement with respect to the Plan, and there are no agreements, understandings, restrictions, representations or warranties among Employee and the Company other than those as set forth or provided for therein.
Entire Agreement
. At its discretion, the Company may establish one or more trusts, with such trustees as the Board may approve, for the purpose of providing for the payment of Plan benefits. Such trust or trusts may be irrevocable, but the assets thereof shall be subject to the claims of the Company's creditors. To the extent any benefits provided under the Plan are actually paid from any such trust, the Company shall have no further obligation with respect thereto, but to the extent not so paid, such benefits shall remain the obligation of, and shall be paid by, the Company. 
Trusts
.
Termination or Amendment of Plan
Prior to a Change of Control, this Plan may be amended by the Company at any time in its sole discretion by resolution by its Board; provided however that no amendment may reduce the amount credited to an Employee's Account on the date of such amendment or accelerate or delay the time at which benefits shall be paid to an Employee or beneficiary pursuant to the Plan, except as permitted under Section 409A.
Prior to a Change of Control, the Company reserves the right to terminate the Plan in its entirety at any time. If the Plan is terminated, the Committee may accelerate the payment of benefits to the Employee only to the extent permitted under Proposed Treasury Regulation 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(A), (B), or (C). If the Plan is terminated under this Section 7.9(b) all benefits shall be valued as of the date of termination and paid at the earliest time allowed under such regulations.
After a Change of Control the Plan may not be amended or terminated without the prior written consent of a majority of Plan participants.
The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and shall be interpreted and construed consistently with such intent. In the event the terms of this Agreement would subject any Employee to taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code ("409A Penalties"), the Company may amend the terms of the Plan to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. To the extent any amounts under this Plan are payable by reference to Employee's "termination of employment," such term shall be deemed to refer to the Employee's "separation from service," within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
Section 409A
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Plan to be executed by a duly authorized officer on this 21st day of October, 2009.

FLIR Systems Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - February 11, 2010) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009. Revenue was $311.6 million, up 3% compared to fourth quarter 2008 revenue of $302.3 million. Excluding the effects of currency translation, revenue for the quarter increased by 1%. Operating income for the quarter was $89.9 million, up 2% from $88.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net income for the quarter was $60.3 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared with net income of $65.0 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter a year ago. Fourth quarter 2008 earnings per share benefited from other income arising from currency gains of approximately $0.04. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $72.3 million.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division decreased 1% from the fourth quarter of 2008, to $169.7 million. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Vision Systems division increased 34% over the fourth quarter of last year, to $57.0 million, reflecting strong growth across multiple product lines. Revenue from the Company's Thermography division decreased 4% from the fourth quarter of last year, to $84.8 million.
Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $ 1,147.1 million, up 7% compared to $1,077.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Operating income for 2009 was $347.3 million, up 22% from $284.5 million during 2008. Net income for 2009 was $230.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared with 2008 net income of $200.9 million, or $1.28 per diluted share. Cash provided by operations during the year was $271.8 million.
The backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $563 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $45 million during the quarter, and a decrease of $100 million, or 15% compared with backlog at December 31, 2008. Backlog in the Government System's division was $433 million, down $54 million during the quarter, as U.S. procurement activity slowed due partly to late approval of government budgets. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $103 million, up $10 million during the quarter due primarily to strong demand for its cores and components and security and surveillance product lines. Backlog in the Thermography division was $27 million, down $1 million during the quarter.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2010
FLIR also announced today that it expects net revenue in fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately 9% compared with 2009, and net earnings to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.53 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 4% compared with 2009.
Management Changes
FLIR announced today that Stephen M. Bailey, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, intends to retire at the end of May, 2010. Mr. Bailey has served in his present position since 2000, and effective June 1, 2010, will be succeeded by Anthony L. Trunzo, who has served as the Company's Senior Vice President for Corporate Strategy and Development since 2003.
"We are pleased with our financial performance in 2009, as we recorded our ninth straight year of record revenue, operating income and earnings per share, and achieved the highest operating income margin and cash flow from operations in the Company's history," stated Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "We are well positioned for long-term growth as we continue to execute on our strategy to drive down the cost of infrared technology. Our 2010 outlook anticipates solid growth from the newly formed Commercial Systems and slower growth in Government Systems as a result of the anticipated decrease in deliveries under BETTS-C and related programs. We remain optimistic that our commercially developed, military qualified model will drive growth in Government Systems in the years to come. I'd also like to thank Steve Bailey for his decade of contributions to FLIR. The transition from Steve to Tony has been well planned and I am confident it will go smoothly."

Based on its financial results for the first quarter of 2010, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management today is reaffirming its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2010. Management currently expects revenue for 2010 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately 9% compared with 2009, and net earnings to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.53 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 4% compared with 2009.
"I am very pleased with our first quarter performance. Our commercial businesses had solid growth year-over-year and Government Systems was little changed, as expected.

"We are seeing a good recovery in our commercial businesses, and expect them to grow nicely for the remainder of 2010 and beyond. The Government Systems division is on track to meet our expectations as we expand our sales footprint and marketing activities to position us for long term growth. As a company, we continue to focus on efficient operations, broad distribution, high quality products, and leadership in promising growth markets."

The transaction value of approximately $180 million includes repayment of all of Raymarine's indebtedness and approximately $24 million in proceeds to Raymarine plc which is equivalent to 20 pence per ordinary share.

Raymarine, a world leader in the marine electronics industry, provides the most comprehensive range of electronic equipment for the recreational boating and light commercial marine markets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, Raymarine reported revenue of approximately $170 million.
The acquisition furthers FLIR's strategy in the marine market by dramatically increasing its maritime distribution network with the addition of Raymarine's 1,000 dealer outlets and 400+ marine OEMs, nearly all of which are additive to FLIR's existing distribution. FLIR plans to expand Raymarine's product line breadth by integrating thermal imaging cameras with Raymarine's display, radar and autopilot product lines to create the broadest, most effective, and easiest to use suite of products in the marine electronics industry.
"We are pleased to announce this strategically compelling transaction," commented Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Raymarine is a leading brand in the industry and has an outstanding reputation for high quality marine electronics equipment. When fully integrated, we expect to have a significant marine electronics business as part of our Commercial Systems business. I welcome Raymarine's employees to FLIR."

FLIR Systems Announces Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - July 22, 2010) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010. Revenue was $331.1 million, up 19% compared to second quarter 2009 revenue of $278.0 million. Excluding the impact of the Raymarine acquisition, second quarter revenue was $303.9 million, an increase of 9%. Operating income in the second quarter was $89.8 million, up 6% from $84.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2010 net income was $59.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared with net income of $55.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the second quarter a year ago. The tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6%, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with the second quarter of 2009, due primarily to non-deductible acquisition expenses, and the lack of R & D tax credits which benefitted prior periods. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $42.7 million.
During the second quarter, Raymarine contributed $27.2 million of revenue and $3.4 million of operating income. Acquisition-related costs and expenses associated with post acquisition restructuring totaled $4.6 million in the quarter and $5.8 million in the first half of the year.
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $618.4 million, up 12% compared to revenue for the first six months of 2009 of $550.0 million. Operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $174.2 million, up 4% from the same period a year ago. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $115.3 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with net income of $109.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operations for the first six months of 2010 was $124.9 million.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 5% from the second quarter of 2009, to $167.9 million. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division increased 16% from the second quarter of 2009, to $136.0 million. Within the Commercial Systems' division, revenue from Commercial Vision Systems increased 27% from the second quarter of last year, to $64.7 million, reflecting strong growth in security, automotive, and personal vision systems. Revenue from Thermography increased 7% from the second quarter of last year, to $71.4 million, reflecting growth across multiple product lines.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $518 million at June 30, 2010, a decrease of $25 million during the quarter. The Raymarine acquisition added $17 million of backlog as of June 30, 2010. Backlog in the Government System's division was $375 million, down $43 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $104 million, up $3 million during the quarter, while backlog in the Thermography division was $22 million, down $2 million during the quarter.
"We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter as the Company continues to perform well across markets and geographies. We are especially pleased with recent growth and profitability trends in our Commercial Vision Systems business and with the continued strong operating margins generated by our Government Systems business. Our strategy to expand the market for infrared technology by driving down costs has delivered an outstanding operating model, balanced growth in uneven economic conditions, and numerous opportunities for future growth," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2010
Based on its financial results for the first half of 2010, the recent Raymarine acquisition, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, management today is increasing its outlook for revenue and reaffirming its outlook for earnings per share for the full year 2010. Management currently expects revenue for 2010 to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and net earnings to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.53 per diluted share.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On August 16, 2010, FLIR Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), Indicator Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Indicator Merger Sub"), and ICx Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ICx"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement").
The Merger Agreement provides that, on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Indicator Merger Sub will, within 20 calendar days of the date of the Merger Agreement, commence a tender offer (the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ICx, $0.001 par value (the "Shares"), for $7.55 in cash per Share (the "Offer Price"). The Board of Directors of each of the Company, Indicator Merger Sub and ICx has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Following a successful consummation of the Offer, Indicator Merger Sub will merge with and into ICx, with ICx surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger"). In the Merger, each outstanding Share that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than Shares held in the treasury of ICx or owned by the Company or Indicator Merger Sub, and other than Shares as to which appraisal rights have been perfected in accordance with applicable law) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
At the effective time of the Merger (i) each outstanding vested ICx option will be canceled, and each holder thereof will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of the Offer Price over the applicable exercise price per Share, multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such option; (ii) each outstanding unvested ICx option and each ICx restricted stock unit will be converted into a Company option or restricted stock unit, as applicable, with appropriate adjustments to the number of shares subject to the award and, in the case of an option, the per share exercise price, to reflect the Merger; and (iii) all outstanding warrants for Shares will be cancelled, and each holder of a warrant will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Offer Price multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such warrant minus (B) the aggregate exercise price for the Shares subject to such warrant, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
Consummation of the Offer is subject to customary conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) at least a majority of outstanding Shares, calculated on a fully diluted basis, being validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn and (ii) approval, or the expiration or termination of all waiting periods, under applicable antitrust laws. Consummation of the Offer is not subject to a financing condition.
The Offer will initially expire on the 20th business day from the commencement thereof. However, until such time as the applicable conditions in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied, the Offer may be, and in certain cases must be, extended by Indicator Merger Sub, but in no event will Indicator Merger Sub be required to extend the offer past February 16, 2011 (the "Termination Date"), in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
 
Consummation of the Merger is also subject to customary conditions, including, if required under Delaware law, approval of the Merger Agreement by ICx's shareholders. The parties have agreed that, if after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and any subsequent offering period, and after giving effect to any Shares purchased pursuant to the Top-Up Option described in the next paragraph, Indicator Merger Sub owns at least 90% of the then-outstanding Shares, then provided that the other conditions of the Merger have been satisfied or waived, Indicator Merger Sub will merge into ICx through a "short-form" merger pursuant to Delaware law, which will not require the approval of ICx's shareholders other than Indicator Merger Sub.
In the Merger Agreement, ICx has granted to Indicator Merger Sub an option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a number of newly issued Shares equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by the Company or Indicator Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share more than 90% of the fully diluted Shares (after giving effect to the issuance of all Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option); provided that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Company's authorized and unissued Shares on a fully diluted basis or, if after the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the Company and Indicator Merger Sub would not own a sufficient number of Shares to cause a short-form merger pursuant to the applicable provisions of Delaware law. Indicator Merger Sub may exercise the Top-Up Option during the 10 business day period following the consummation of the Offer and, if any subsequent offering period is provided, during the 10 business day period following the expiration date of such subsequent offering period. The Top-Up Option will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the periods referenced in the preceding sentence and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.
In addition, under the Merger Agreement, effective upon the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company will be entitled to designate a number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on ICx's Board of Directors and the committees thereof, equal to the product of (i) the total number of directors on ICx's Board of Directors or the committees thereof, as applicable, and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by the Company and/or Indicator Merger Sub bears to the number of Shares then outstanding.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by ICx, Indicator Merger Sub and the Company. The Merger Agreement also contains customary covenants and agreements, including with respect to the operation of the business of ICx and its subsidiaries between signing of the Merger Agreement and closing of the Merger, solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals by ICx, governmental filings and approvals, employee benefits and other matters.
Both the Merger Agreement and the Offer may be terminated under certain customary circumstances by the Company and/or ICx, including if the Offer has not been consummated on or before the Termination Date, if the Offer shall have expired or terminated in accordance with its terms without any Shares being purchased therein, if Indicator Merger Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer by the date that is 20 days following the date of the Merger Agreement or upon material uncured breach by the Company or Indicator Merger Sub, in the case of ICx, or by ICx, in the case of the Company, of any representation, warranty or covenant on the part of the Company, Indicator Merger Sub or ICx, as applicable, or if any representation or warranty of the Company or Indicator Merger Sub, in the case of ICx, or by ICx, in the case of the Company, shall have become untrue in any material respect. The Merger Agreement provides that the Company's and Indicator Merger Sub's fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the Merger Agreement, in an amount up to $2,000,000, shall be paid by ICx to the Company under certain circumstances if the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company as a result of any breach or inaccuracy of ICx's representations or warranties or any breach of ICx's covenants contained in the Merger Agreement.
 
The Company may also terminate the Merger Agreement in the event that the Board of Directors of ICx withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to the Company or Indicator Merger Sub its recommendation of the Offer or the Merger or recommends or approves an alternative acquisition proposal. ICx may terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior alternative acquisition proposal under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides for a termination fee of $8,200,000, payable by ICx to the Company, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including those described in this paragraph.
The Merger Agreement is included as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K to provide additional information regarding the terms of the transactions described herein and is not intended to provide any other factual information or disclosure about the Company, ICx or Indicator Merger Sub. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of a specific date, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement (except as to certain indemnification obligations), are subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by disclosure schedules made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between and among the parties thereto instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company's public disclosures. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and, in light of the foregoing reasons, should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, ICx, Indicator Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text thereof, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
Tender and Support Agreement
Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, certain affiliates of Wexford Capital LP (the "Wexford Entities") holding approximately 62% of the outstanding Shares entered into a Tender and Support Agreement with the Company and Indicator Merger Sub under which they, among other things, (i) agreed to tender all of their Subject Shares (as defined below) pursuant to the Offer, (ii) agreed to vote the Subject Shares in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (and in favor of any other matter necessary for consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and against any other agreement or arrangement related to another proposal to acquire ICx or any liquidation dissolution, recapitalization extraordinary dividend or other significant corporate reorganization of ICx, and (iii) agreed not to exercise any appraisal rights in respect to the Subject Shares which may arise in connection with the Merger. The "Subject Shares" are all Shares beneficially owned by the Wexford Entities apart from Shares issuable upon exercise of options and restricted Shares but only to the extent such Shares remain unvested, unexercised or restricted.
The Tender and Support Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) the effectiveness of the Merger and (iii) a reduction of the Offer Price or amendment to the minimum number of Shares required to be tendered pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Wexford Entities will have no obligation to tender or vote their Subject Shares in accordance with the Tender and Support Agreement in the event of a Change in Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement) made in compliance with the Merger Agreement (unless such Change in Recommendation is later withdrawn by ICx's Board of Directors).
A copy of the Tender and Support Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.2 and incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Tender and Support Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Tender and Support Agreement.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K ("current report") contains statements that are forward-looking in nature and express the Company's current opinions about trends and factors that may impact future operating results. Statements that use words such as "may," "will," "should," "believes," "predicts," "estimates," "projects," "anticipates" or "expects" or use similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's and ICx's business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including the following: the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of ICx, calculated on a fully diluted basis, the possibility that the transaction will not close or that the closing may be delayed, the possibility that the Company will experience difficulties in the integration of the operations, employees, strategies, technologies and products of ICx if the transaction does close, the potential inability to realize expected benefits and synergies, changes in demand for the Company's or ICx's products, product mix, the timing of customer orders and deliveries, the impact of competitive products and pricing, constraints on supplies of critical components, excess or shortage of production capacity, the ability of the Company to manufacture and ship products in the time period required, actual purchases under agreements, and other risks discussed from time to time in the Company's and ICx's respective Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, and general domestic and international economic conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release.
Important Additional Information
The tender offer (the "Offer") described in this current report for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ICx has not yet commenced. FLIR Systems, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary Indicator Merger Sub, Inc. ("Indicator Merger Sub") intend to file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (including an Offer to Purchase, Letter of Transmittal and related tender offer documents, the "Tender Offer Documents") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). This current report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell, shares of common stock of ICx, nor is it a substitute for the Tender Offer Documents.
Investors and ICx stockholders are strongly advised to read the Tender Offer Documents, the related Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 that will be filed by ICx with the SEC, and other relevant materials when they become available, as they will contain important information.
Investors and ICx stockholders can obtain copies of these materials (and all other related documents filed with the SEC) when available, at no charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Copies can also be obtained at no charge by directing a request to Indicator Merger Sub at FLIR Systems, Inc., 27700 SW Parkway Avenue, Wilsonville, Oregon 97070. Investors and ICx stockholders may also read and copy any reports, statements and other information filed by FLIR, Indicator Merger Sub or ICx with the SEC, at the SEC public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.

Item 2.01.    Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
 
On October 4, 2010, FLIR Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("FLIR"), completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), of ICx Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ICx"), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 16, 2010 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among FLIR, Indicator Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of FLIR (the "Purchaser") and ICx.
FLIR's acquisition of the Shares was structured as a two-step transaction, with a cash tender offer by the Purchaser for the Shares at a price of $7.55 per Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated September 3, 2010, and in the related Letter of Transmittal, each as amended and supplemented from time to time, filed by FLIR and the Purchaser with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 3, 2010 (the "Off er"), followed by the merger of the Purchaser with and into ICx (the "Merger").
The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on October 1, 2010. Based upon information provided by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the depositary for the Offer (the "Depositary"), a total of 32,683,590 Shares were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer, representing approximately 93.4% of the Shares outstanding. In addition, the Depositary has advised FLIR that it has received commitments to tender 469,704 additional Shares under guaranteed delivery procedures. On October 4, 2010, the Purchaser accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer.
On October 4, 2010, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Purchaser completed the Merger in accordance with the provisions of Delaware law that authorize the completion of the Merger without a vote or meeting of the stockholders of ICx. ICx was the surviving corporation in the Merger and, as a result of the Merger, has become a wholly owned subsidiary of FLIR. In the Merger, each Share (other than Shares held by ICx as treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by FLIR, the Purchaser, or any of their subsidiaries, and Shares held by holders who properly exercise their appraisal rights under Delaware law) was cancelled and converted into the right to receive $7.55 per Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes.
In connection with the consummation of the Merger, an application to terminate the registration of the Shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, was filed and, effective as of the close of trading on October 4, 2010, the Shares ceased to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The foregoing summary description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was included as Exhibit 2.1 to FLIR's Current Report on For m 8-K, filed August 20, 2010, and which is incorporated herein by reference.
The aggregate consideration paid by FLIR was approximately $268 million. FLIR funded the acquisition from available cash.

PORTLAND, OR, October 4, 2010 (MARKET WIRE) -- FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) announced today that it has successfully completed its previously announced acquisition of ICx Technologies, Inc. for $7.55 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $268 million, or an enterprise value of $232 million including ICx's closing cash balance. On August 16, 2010, FLIR announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ICx through a tender offer and subject to certain conditions.

FLIR Systems Announces Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results
Revenue Up by 16%; Increasing Revenue and EPS Outlook for 2010
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - October 21, 2010) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010. Revenue was $332.5 million, up 16% compared to third quarter 2009 revenue of $285.6 million. Operating income in the third quarter was $85.8 million, compared to $89.3 million in the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 net income was $63.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with net income of $60.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the third quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was $85.1 million.
FLIR Systems, Inc.
During the third quarter, Raymarine contributed $36.9 million of revenue and $1.0 million of operating income. Corporate expenses were impacted by $2.5 million in costs associated with the acquisition of ICx Technologies. The Company also reached an agreement in principle to settle all pending patent claims relating to a lawsuit dating back to 2007. This settlement resulted in an accrual of $3.0 million in the third quarter.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $950.9 million, up 14% compared to revenue for the first nine months of 2009 of $835.5 million. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $259.9 million, up 1% from the same period a year ago. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $178.3 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with net income of $170.0 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Acquisition-related expenses, including expenses associated with post-acquisition restructuring at Raymarine, totaled $8.3 million in the first nine months of the year. Cash provided by operations for the first nine months of 2010 was $209.9 million.
Revenue during the quarter from the Company's Government Systems division was flat from the third quarter of 2009, at $163.2 million. Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division, excluding Raymarine, increased 8% from the third quarter of 2009, to $132.4 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from Commercial Vision Systems increased 17% from the third quarter of last year, to $61.4 million, reflecting strong growth in transportation, cores and personal vision systems. Revenue from Thermography increased 2% from the third quarter of last year, to $71.0 million, with growth in gas imaging and test and measurement markets partially offset by weakness in Europe.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $533 million at September 30, 2010, an increase of $15 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $386 million, up $10 million during the quarter, due to strong U.S. government orders. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $116 million, up $12 million during the quarter, while backlog in the Thermography division was $23 million, up $1 million during the quarter.
"We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Operating income was reduced by legal reserves and acquisition-related costs, but these costs were largely offset by a lower tax rate and our resulting margins were very strong. We continue to execute on our strategy and deliver strong operating performance. Our Government Systems division was able to grow backlog in an unclear political environment. The Commercial Systems division continues to grow rapidly while increasing profitability. Our initiatives to diversify our end-markets, reduce costs, innovate, and strengthen our financial position have positioned us very well for continued growth into the future," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO.
Based on financial results for the first nine months of 2010, the recent Raymarine and ICx acquisitions, and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR management is increasing its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2010. Management currently expects revenue for 2010 to be in the range of $1.375 billion to $1.4 billion and net earnings to be in the range of $1.53 to $1.56 per diluted share.

FLIR Systems Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Financial Results
Revenue Up by 39%; Issues Revenue and EPS Outlook for 2011
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - February 09, 2011) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010. Revenue was $434.4 million, up 39% compared to fourth quarter 2009 revenue of $311.6 million. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $100.6 million, up 12% from $89.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 net income from continuing operations was $70.3 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared with net income of $60.3 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the fourth quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations in the fourth quarter was $45.5 million.
During the fourth quarter, the Company closed its acquisition of ICx Technologies, Inc., and the segment contributed $46.1 million of revenue and $2.1 million of operating income. ICx fourth quarter operating income was impacted by $5.2 million of expenses associated with acquisition-related intangibles and inventory amortization, as well as by $1.4 million in force reduction charges. Additionally, FLIR corporate expenses during the quarter were impacted by $2.2 million in costs associated with the acquisition of ICx. Several ICx entities are anticipated to be divested and have been classified as discontinued operations, with combined net losses during the quarter of $0.5 million.
Revenue during the quarter from the Company's Government Systems segment increased 1% from the fourth quarter of 2009, to $171.7 million. Revenue from the Company's Thermography segment increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2009, to $100.0 million, driven by growth in the Asia Pacific region and strong sales of both value and mid-priced cameras. Revenue from Commercial Vision Systems increased 35% from the fourth quarter of last year, to $76.7 million, reflecting strong growth in cores and security products. Revenue from Raymarine was $40.0 million with operating income of $3.9 million.
For the full year, revenue was $1,385.3 million, up 21% compared to $1,147.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income for 2010 was $360.6 million, up 4% from $347.3 million in 2009. Net income from continuing operations for 2010 was $248.6 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared with 2009 net income of $230.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share. Cash provided by operations during the year was $255.4 million.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $534 million at December 31, 2010, no change from the previous quarter, and a decrease of $29 million, or 5% compared with backlog at December 31, 2009. Backlog in the Government Systems segment was $325 million, down $61 million during the quarter, primarily due to delayed procurement by the U.S. government, offset by strong international orders. ICx backlog was $62 million as of December 31, 2010. Backlog in the Commercial Vision Systems division was $114 million, down $3 million during the quarter, while backlog in the Thermography division was $22 million, down $1 million during the quarter. Raymarine ended 2010 with $11 million in backlog of firm orders, an increase of $2 million during the quarter.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2011
FLIR also announced today that it expects revenue in 2011 to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.73 billion, an increase of approximately 18% to 25% compared with 2010, and net income to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 7% to 14% compared to 2010.
"Each of our segments delivered growth in the fourth quarter, and 2010 finished as our tenth consecutive year of record revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. We intend to continue this success by relying on our commercial mindset, a strong innovation engine, our increasingly global customer base, our entrenched distribution channels, and a continually evolving line of leading products," noted Earl R. Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Sustained superior financial performance while enabling a growing number of customers to benefit from the valuable information our sensors provide remains our driving goal."

Item 1.01.    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
On February 8, 2011, FLIR Systems, Inc. ("FLIR") entered into an unsecured $200 million five-year revolving credit agreement ("New Credit Agreement"), effective immediately, among FLIR, certain subsidiaries as Designated Borrowers, the lenders named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent; U.S. Bank National Association, as Syndication Agent; JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, as Documentation Agent; and other Lenders.
In connection with its entry into the New Credit Agreement, FLIR terminated, effective February 8, 2011, its existing $300 million five-year revolving credit agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), dated as of October 6, 2006, among FLIR, certain subsidiaries as Designated Borrowers, the lenders named therein, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent; Union Bank of California, N.A., as Syndication Agent; U.S. Bank National Association, as Documentation Agent; and other Lenders. No early termination penalties were incurred by FLIR as a result of the termination of the Existing Credit Facility.
Under the New Credit Agreement, FLIR may designate its subsidiaries as borrowers for which FLIR and its Material Domestic Subsidiaries will act as guarantors. Borrowing rates under the New Credit Agreement are determined at FLIR's option at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime lending rate of Bank of America, N.A. or the rate of interest paid for deposits in the relevant currency, plus a specified margin based on an established consolidated total leverage ratio grid. Subject to certain conditions precedent, FLIR has the right at any time to increase the total amount of its commitments under the New Credit Agreement by an aggregate additional amount not to exceed $150 million. FLIR is obligated to pay a commitment fee based on the average daily unused amount of the commitments under the New Credit Agreement. The provisions of the New Credit Agreement, including representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, are less restrictive in comparison to the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement. Unlike the Existing Credit Agreement, the New Credit Agreement is unsecured and contains only two financial covenants, a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit.
The foregoing description of the New Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the New Credit Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to FLIR's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. The foregoing description of the Existing Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Existing Credit Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to FLIR's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 12, 2006.
Some of the financial institutions party to the New Credit Agreement and the Existing Credit Agreement and their respective affiliates have performed, and/or may in the future perform, various commercial banking, investment banking and other financial advisory services in the ordinary course of business for FLIR and its respective subsidiaries, for which they have received, and/or will receive, customary fees and commissions.

FLIR Systems Announces First Quarter 2011 Financial Results
Revenue Up by 30%; Narrowing EPS Outlook for 2011
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - April 29, 2011) - FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011. Revenue was $373.5 million, up 30% compared to first quarter 2010 revenue of $287.3 million. Operating income in the first quarter was $76.6 million, compared to $84.3 million in the first quarter of 2010, and was impacted by a lack of RAID shipments as well as acquisition-related charges. First quarter 2011 net income was $51.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with net income of $55.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in the first quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $62.4 million.
Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division increased 51% from the first quarter of 2010, to $194.6 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from the Thermal Vision and Measurement segment, made up of FLIR's former Thermography and Commercial Vision Systems ("CVS") businesses, was $144.1 million, an increase of 12% over the first quarter combined results of Thermography and CVS last year. Commercial Systems' Raymarine segment contributed $50.5 million of revenue during the quarter.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 13% over the first quarter of 2010, to $178.8 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment, comprised of the legacy Government Systems business and the imaging and radars businesses acquired with the fourth quarter 2010 acquisition of ICx Technologies, Inc., was $149.9 million, a decrease of 5% from the first quarter of 2010 results of the Company's legacy Government Systems business. Revenues from Government Systems' other two new segments, Detection and Integrated Systems, which were created following the acquisition of ICx, were $17.9 and $11.1 million, respectively.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $528 million at March 31, 2011, a decrease of $6 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $360 million, decreasing $27 million during the quarter despite significant international order activity. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $168 million, up $21 million during the quarter, a result of successful new product introductions.
"This quarter showcased the diversified nature of the business and the resiliency of our company. We released innovative products during the quarter that resulted in order volumes that outstripped our production forecasts. As anticipated, our Government Systems division was impacted by slowed U.S. procurement, but executed well and worked diligently to position the businesses for continued growth. Overall, we performed as we had expected during the quarter, had excellent cash flow, and believe the balance of the year will show improved results," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2011
Based on financial results for the first three months of 2011 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR management is increasing its outlook for revenue and narrowing its outlook for earnings per share for the full year 2011. Management currently expects revenue for 2011 to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion and net earnings to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.75 per diluted share.

Operating income in the second quarter was $41.7 million, compared to $89.8 million in the second quarter of 2010, and was impacted by a previously announced litigation settlement and related expenses, as well as delayed government procurement. Second quarter 2011 net income was $29.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with net income of $59.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding the net after tax impact of the litigation settlement and related expenses, second quarter 2011 net income was $57.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share.

Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division increased 4% over the second quarter of 2010, to $174.9 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment was $141.5 million, a decrease of 16% from the second quarter of 2010 results of the Company's legacy Government Systems business.

The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $486 million at June 30, 2011, a decrease of $42 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $319 million, decreasing $41 million during the quarter as a result of procurement delays. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $167 million, down $1 million during the quarter.
FLIR today also announced that it has acquired Aerius Photonics, LLC, a leading provider of short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) detectors and advanced laser components, for $27 million in cash. Aerius Photonics, based in Ventura, California, specializes in the design, development, and manufacture of high-sensitivity photonic components for use in various applications in the commercial and military markets. Products include indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs)-based infrared detectors, high-powered vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) diodes, ultra-lightweight laser rangefinders and altimeters, and infrared illuminators and pointers.
"The second quarter finished with solid results for our Commercial Systems division, which posted one of its best growth quarters along with substantially improved profitability. Our Government Systems division was impacted by order and shipment delays," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "We are excited to add Aerius to our Commercial Systems business. Aerius will enhance our ability to serve OEMs in numerous sectors as well as augment our multi-spectral systems development capabilities."
Based on financial results for the first half of 2011 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR is reducing its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2011.

Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party's election so to assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 8 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the next preceding sentence, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures.
(d) The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by Section 8(c) hereof, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Settlements.
 
S 9. . If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Notes pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth on the front cover page of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate initial public offering price of the Notes as set forth on such cover. The relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters, on the other hand, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
ECTION
Contribution
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8(c), any reasonable legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.
The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter in connection with the Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective underwriting commitments as set forth opposite their names in Schedule A. For purposes of this Section 9, each director, officer, employee, affiliate and agent of an Underwriter and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company with the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.
S 10. . If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the several Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Notes that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, and the aggregate principal amount of Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be purchased on such date, the other Underwriters shall be obligated, severally, in the proportion that the aggregate principal amounts of such Notes set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bear to the aggregate principal amount of such Notes set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Underwriters, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Representatives with the consent of the non-defaulting Underwriters, to purchase such Notes which such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed or refused to purchase on such date. If, on the Closing Date, any one or more of the Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase such Notes and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Notes are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In any such case, either the Representatives or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if any, to the Registration Statement, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any other documents or arrangements may be effected.
ECTION
Default of One or More of the Several Underwriters
As used in this Agreement, the term "Underwriter" shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Underwriter under this Section 10. Any action taken under this Section 10 shall not relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of such Underwriter under this Agreement.
 
S 11. . Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to the Company if at any time: (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company's securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or The NASDAQ Stock Market, or trading in securities generally on either The NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such stock exchanges by the Commission or the FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal or New York authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity involving the United States, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States' or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Notes in the manner and on the terms described in the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; (iv) in the judgment of the Representatives there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change; or (v) there shall have occurred a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services. Any termination pursuant to this Section 11 shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Sections 4 and 6 hereof, and provided further that Sections 4, 6, 8, 9 and 17 shall survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
As previously reported, on August 16, 2011, FLIR Systems, Inc. ("FLIR") entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement") with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the "Underwriters"), pursuant to which FLIR agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.750% notes due 2016 (the "Notes").
On August 19, 2011 the parties completed the offering, and the Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture (the "Supplemental Indenture," the Base Indenture as amended and supplemented by the Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), dated as of such date, by and between FLIR and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of FLIR and rank equally with all of FLIR's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.750% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing March 1, 2012. The Notes will mature on September 1, 2016.
FLIR may redeem the Notes in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:
 
 
If FLIR experiences a "Change of Control Triggering Event" (as defined in the Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the Notes, unless FLIR has exercised its right to redeem the Notes, each holder of Notes will have the right to require FLIR to repurchase all or a portion of such holder's Notes at a price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of FLIR and its subsidiaries to create or secure certain liens; enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of FLIR's assets. The above restrictions are subject in each case to important limitations and exceptions as specified in the Indenture.
The Indenture contains customary event of default provisions. If an event of default occurs and is continuing other than an event of default regarding certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to FLIR, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes may declare the Notes to be immediately due and payable. In the case of an event of default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization relating to FLIR, the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of Notes.
The public offering price of the Notes was 99.999% of the principal amount. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $248 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, and intends to use such proceeds for general corporate purposes.
The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to FLIR's automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-176311) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which became effective upon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on August 15, 2011. The Company has filed with the SEC a prospectus supplement dated August 16, 2011, together with the accompanying prospectus, dated August 15, 2011, relating to the offering and sale of the Notes.
The foregoing description of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Base Indenture, Supplemental Indenture and the form of Note, copies of which are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.
The Trustee and its affiliates have engaged in and may continue to engage in certain banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with FLIR and its affiliates. It has received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant

FLIR Systems Announces First Quarter 2012 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - April 27, 2012) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012. Revenue was $348.5 million, down 7% compared to first quarter 2011 revenue of $376.0 million. Operating income in the first quarter was $68.3 million, compared to $76.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 net income was $48.1 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net income of $51.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $49.0 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $25.39 per share.
FLIR Systems, Inc.
Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division increased 4% from the first quarter of 2011, to $202.3 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from the Thermal Vision and Measurement segment was $155.7 million, an increase of 7% over the first quarter results last year. Commercial Systems' Raymarine segment contributed $46.6 million of revenue during the first quarter, down 8% from the prior year.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division decreased 19% from the first quarter of 2011, to $146.1 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment was $114.6 million, a decrease of 24% from the first quarter of 2011. Revenue from Government Systems' Detection segment was $19.4 million, an increase of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Government Systems' Integrated Systems segment contributed $12.2 million of revenue during the first quarter, a decrease of 5% from the prior year.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $457 million as of March 31, 2012, an increase of $2 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $312 million, decreasing $2 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $145 million, up $4 million during the quarter.
"While not up to our standards, first quarter performance was about as anticipated," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "A difficult market environment impacted our Government Systems business, but we successfully stabilized backlog as Government Systems orders equaled revenue for the quarter. Our Commercial Systems business was slow in the first quarter, however, we continue to expect improved results as we go through the year. It is clearly our task to improve in the future, and we believe these efforts will show in the second half of 2012."
Based on financial results for the first three months of 2012 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR is reaffirming its outlook for earnings per share for the full year 2012. Management expects net earnings to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share, and revenue for the full year 2012 to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2012
FLIR's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share on FLIR common stock, payable June 8, 2012, to shareholders of record as of close of business on May 21, 2012.

FLIR Systems Announces Preliminary Revenue and EPS Results for Second Quarter 2012 and Updated Full Year Revenue and EPS Outlook
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - July 16, 2012) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced preliminary revenue and earnings per share results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. FLIR expects to post revenues of approximately $338 million and earnings per share of approximately $0.26 for the three months ended June 30, 2012. Excluding the net after tax impact of severance costs, earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2012, is expected to be approximately $0.30. The Company's second quarter performance reflected in these preliminary results was negatively impacted by weakness in several markets including predictive maintenance and building, cores and components, and recreational marine, particularly in Europe. Delays in customer delivery schedules negatively impacted revenue during the quarter, particularly in the cores and components line of products in the Thermal Vision and Measurement (TVM) segment. Margins during the quarter were negatively impacted by product mix and factory absorption due to lower than anticipated revenue.
FLIR Systems, Inc.
Total bookings for the quarter were approximately $375 million, resulting in an increase in backlog of approximately $41 million compared to the first quarter of 2012. The TVM, Surveillance, and Detection segments each increased segment backlog during the quarter. Operating cash flow was approximately $80 million in the second quarter.
Management has re-evaluated its previously announced revenue and earnings outlook for the full year 2012 and now expects revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, a decrease of approximately 3% to 9% compared to 2011, and net income to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share, an increase of approximately 1% to 9% compared to 2011. Supporting the second half outlook are the increase in backlog during the second quarter and a stronger outlook for orders in the second half of the year.
"We are disappointed in our second quarter performance," said Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "These results caused us to make additional reductions to our cost structure that will be reflected in improved profitability in future periods. Most importantly, we are confident that the second half of 2012 will be significantly better than the first half, and we expect to see a resumption of meaningful earnings growth in the fourth quarter."
FLIR will release full results for the second quarter of 2012 on Thursday, July 26, 2012, at approximately 7:30 a.m. ET (4:30 a.m. PT). Additionally, management has scheduled a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET (5:00 a.m. PT) that morning to discuss the results for the second quarter.

FLIR Systems Announces Second Quarter 2012 Financial Results
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - July 26, 2012) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. Revenue was $338.3 million, down 14% compared to second quarter 2011 revenue of $391.6 million. Operating income in the second quarter was $60.7 million, compared to $41.8 million in the second quarter of 2011, and was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of approximately $6.8 million before tax. Second quarter 2012 net income was $41.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with net income of $29.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share in the second quarter a year ago. Excluding the net after tax impact of the restructuring costs referred to above, second quarter 2012 net income was $46.1 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was $77.2 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $21.60 per share.
FLIR Systems, Inc.
Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division decreased 12% from the second quarter of 2011, to $189.8 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from the Thermal Vision and Measurement segment was $142.6 million, a decrease of 13% from the second quarter results last year. The Raymarine segment contributed $47.2 million of revenue during the second quarter, down 6% from the prior year.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division decreased 16% from the second quarter of 2011, to $148.5 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment was $119.5 million, a decrease of 16% from the second quarter of 2011. Revenue from the Detection segment was $15.7 million, a decrease of 9% compared to the second quarter of 2011, and the Integrated Systems segment contributed $13.3 million of revenue during the second quarter, a decrease of 26% from the prior year.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $498 million as of June 30, 2012, an increase of $41 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $334 million, increasing $22 million during the quarter. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $164 million, up $19 million during the quarter.
"This second quarter proved difficult for our company," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Macroeconomic conditions impacted many of our largest markets, but we continued to manage our business in response to these challenges. Both divisions had meaningful increases in backlog during the quarter, and we further streamlined our operations. While the first half of 2012 underperformed our expectations, we anticipate an improved second half and a return to earnings growth in the fourth quarter."
As announced previously, based on financial results for the first half of 2012 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR has modified its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2012. Management currently expects revenue for 2012 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and net earnings to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 per diluted share. This compares to the prior outlook of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion in revenue and $1.60 to $1.70 in earnings per diluted share for the full year 2012.

Dear Ms. Yerger:
I write in response to your letter of July 31, 2012. At its recent meeting, the Board of Directors of FLIR Systems, Inc. (the "Board") determined that, in connection with the Company's 2013 Annual Meeting, it would put forth shareholder proposals that will (i) begin the process of eliminating the classification of the Board, and (ii) initiate the appropriate process to amend the Company's articles of incorporation to provide that director nominees will be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at each annual meeting of shareholders.
I trust the foregoing answers your inquiry.
Sincerely,
/s/ William W. Davis
William W. Davis Senior Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary

FLIR Systems Completes Acquisition of Lorex Technology for $60 Million
PORTLAND, OR, December 20, 2012
-- FLIR Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: FLIR) announced today that it has successfully completed its previously announced acquisition of Lorex Technology Inc. for $1.32 per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of $60 million. On October 25, 2012, FLIR announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Lorex subject to certain conditions. The transaction was completed by a FLIR subsidiary purchasing all the outstanding shares of Lorex followed by the amalgamation of that purchasing subsidiary with Lorex, resulting in Lorex becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLIR.
The acquisition was completed upon receipt of final court approval from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) of the proposed plan of arrangement. The plan of arrangement was approved by Lorex's shareholders at the special meeting of shareholders held on December 13, 2012.
Lorex, based in Markham, Ontario, is a pioneer in home security video surveillance systems that can be installed by the user as well as a provider of video surveillance products to security system integrators. Lorex provides homes and businesses bundled video surveillance systems and equipment that includes connected visible light video cameras, illuminated infrared cameras, digital video recorders, video monitors, baby monitors, and wearable action sports cameras. The company sells its solutions through retailers such as Costco, BJ's Wholesale, Amazon.com, and BestBuy.com, as well as through distributors of large-scale security solutions.
"Adding Lorex will complement our product and distribution capabilities in our existing security markets," said Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Additionally, we believe the business will provide us an opportunity to expand our reach into several new markets as we continue our strategy of lowering the cost to own thermal technology."
FLIR Systems, Inc. is a world leader in the design, manufacture, and marketing of sensor systems that enhance perception and awareness. The Company's advanced thermal imaging and threat detection systems are used for a wide variety of imaging, thermography, and security applications, including airborne and ground-based surveillance, condition monitoring, research and development, manufacturing process control, search and rescue, drug interdiction, navigation, transportation safety, border and maritime patrol, environmental monitoring, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE) detection.

The statements in this press release by Earl Lewis and the other statements in this release about the acquisition described above are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about FLIR's and Lorex's businesses based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including the following: the possibility that FLIR will experience difficulties in the integration of the operations, employees, strategies, technologies and products of Lorex, the potential inability to realize expected benefits and synergies, changes in demand for FLIR or Lorex product, the impact of competitive products and pricing, FLIR's continuing compliance with U.S. export control laws and regulations, the ability of FLIR or Lorex to manufacture and ship products in the time period required, and other risks discussed from time to time in FLIR's Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, and general domestic and international economic conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and FLIR does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release for changes made to this document by wire services or Internet service providers.

FLIR Systems Announces First Quarter 2013 Financial Results and Management Changes
First Quarter EPS Increases 13%; Andrew Teich to Succeed Earl Lewis as President and CEO
PORTLAND, OR -- (Marketwire - April 26, 2013) - (NASDAQ: FLIR) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013. Revenue was $348.6 million, largely unchanged compared to first quarter 2012 revenue of $348.5 million. Operating income in the first quarter was $69.1 million, compared to $68.3 million in the first quarter of 2012. First quarter 2013 net income was $51.6 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with net income of $48.1 million, or $0.31 per diluted share in the first quarter a year ago. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $62.0 million. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $26.22 per share.
FLIR Systems, Inc.
Revenue from the Company's Commercial Systems division increased 5% from the first quarter of 2012, to $211.8 million. Within the Commercial Systems division, revenue from the Thermal Vision and Measurement segment was $167.4 million, an increase of 7% from the first quarter results last year. The Raymarine segment contributed $44.4 million of revenue during the first quarter, down 5% from the prior year.
Revenue from the Company's Government Systems division decreased 6% from the first quarter of 2012, to $136.8 million. Within the Government Systems division, revenue from the Surveillance segment was $110.2 million, a decrease of 4% from the first quarter of 2012. Revenue from the Detection segment was $12.5 million, a decrease of 35% compared to the first quarter of 2012, and the Integrated Systems segment contributed $14.0 million of revenue during the first quarter, an increase of 15% from the prior year.
The Company's backlog of firm orders for delivery within the next twelve months was approximately $505 million as of March 31, 2013, a decrease of $15 million during the quarter and an increase of $48 million over the prior year. Backlog in the Government Systems division was $334 million, decreasing $22 million during the quarter and increasing $22 million over the prior year. Backlog in the Commercial Systems division was $172 million, increasing $8 million during the quarter and $27 million over the prior year.
"First quarter results were consistent with our expectations for how the year would begin," noted Earl Lewis, President and CEO of FLIR. "Despite the difficult funding and macro environment our customers are experiencing, both of our divisions have meaningfully higher backlog than they did a year ago and our focus on organizational efficiency and cost control resulted in increased margins and net earnings growth. In addition, we continue to generate operating cash at a rate that significantly exceeds net income, which will allow us to generate strong returns for our shareholders."
Based on financial results for the first three months of 2013 and the outlook for the remainder of the year, FLIR is reaffirming its outlook for revenue and earnings per share for the full year 2013. Management expects revenue for 2013 to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion and net earnings to be in the range of $1.56 to $1.66 per diluted share.
Revenue and Earnings Outlook for 2013
Mr. Lewis has announced his intention to retire as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective May 19, 2013. He will assume a senior advisor role to the Company to aid in the transition and will remain Chairman of the Board of Directors of FLIR. Mr. Andrew C. Teich, currently President of the Company's Commercial Systems division, will assume the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR upon Mr. Lewis's retirement. "This is the culmination of a process that began more than two years ago with three of my direct reports completing the Harvard Advanced Management Program," said Mr. Lewis. "Approximately a year ago, we formed a special committee of the Board of Directors and hired outside consultants to begin the difficult process of selecting one person from among three excellent internal candidates in Bill Sundermeier, Tony Trunzo, and Andy. The difficulty in making a final decision was a result of the Board's strong belief that all three were highly competent and capable leaders."
Management Succession
"I am, of course, very pleased to be offered the opportunity to lead FLIR," said Mr. Teich. "I look forward to leading this outstanding management team and our global group of dedicated employees to the next level of growth."
FLIR's Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share on FLIR common stock, payable June 7, 2013, to shareholders of record as of close of business on May 20, 2013.

Dear Earl:
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the terms by which you will continue to be engaged by FLIR Systems, Inc.

The key terms of your service shall be as follows:
1.
Term and Termination.
Your voluntary retirement as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall become effective on May 19, 2013 (the Separation Date). The Company hereby agrees to waive the requirement of thirty (30) days written notice of your voluntary retirement as otherwise required under the Executive Employment Agreement between you and the Company, dated as of January 1, 2013 (the Employment Agreement). Following the Separation Date, you agree to serve as Non-Executive Chairman and as Senior Advisor to the Company for a period of two years after the Separation Date (the Term); provided that (i) you may terminate the Term earlier than as set forth herein following thirty (30) days prior written notice of such termination to the Company, (ii) the Company may terminate the Term, but only for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement), provided that the Board may select another individual to serve as Chairman of the Board during the Term and such an election shall not constitute for purposes of this agreement a termination of the Term, and (iii) the Term shall terminate immediately upon your death.
2.
    
Senior Advisor Services.
In addition to your services as Non-Executive Chairman and as a director, you agree that as Senior Advisor you will provide transition and other related advisory and consulting services to the Company during the Term in order to assist in providing an effective transition of your executive responsibilities to your successor as President and Chief Executive Officer. You will advise both the Board of Directors (the Board) and your successor on matters involving Company strategy, mergers and acquisitions, organizational considerations and other matters specified by the Board. You shall diligently and competently perform such services and use reasonable efforts in connection with the performance of such services. You and the Company agree that (i) during the first 12 months of the Term, the anticipated level of all services that you will perform for the Company as Senior Advisor will not be in excess of 10 hours per week, which is less than 20% of the average level of services that you had performed for the Company during the three-year period prior to the Separation Date, and (ii) during the remainder of the Term, the anticipated level of services that you will perform for the Company as Senior Advisor will not be in excess of five hours per week. Upon presentation of appropriate receipts, the Company will reimburse you for all documented, out-of-pocket expenses you incur in the performance of your duties as Non-Executive Chairman and Senior Advisor, including, but not limited to, expenses you incur when traveling on Company business.
3.
    
Compensation.
As compensation for your service as a director, the Company will pay you the Board retainers and committee and meeting fees in effect during the Term, and as additional compensation for your service as Non-Executive Chairman, the Company will pay you an annual retainer

of $100,000. You will not be eligible for an equity grant with respect to your Board service in 2013, but you will receive an equity grant for such service in 2014 in accordance with the Companys Board compensation policy then in effect. As compensation for your services as a Senior Advisor, the Company will pay you an advisory fee in the amount of $900,000 per annum during the first 12 months of the Term and $450,000 per annum for the remainder of the Term, payable in equal monthly installments. You and your dependents may continue your participation in the Companys group health plan in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (COBRA). You will be required to pay the full cost of the premiums under the Health Plan, and the Company will reimburse you for the portion of such premiums that would be paid by the Company if you were an active employee. For the avoidance of doubt, you will be entitled to no additional compensation for your services following the Separation Date except as set forth in this section.
4.
    
Employment Agreement.
You and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that all payments and benefits to which you may be entitled upon your voluntary resignation shall be governed by, and subject to the requirements of, the Employment Agreement, including Section 4.4 thereof, and all other Company plans and programs in which you participate, including without limitation the Companys Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan and all outstanding equity award agreements. During the Term, your equity compensation awards will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms, and your services as Senior Advisor shall be taken into account as continuous consulting service with respect to such awards.
5.

6.
    
Relationship.
It is the intention of the parties to this letter agreement that, during the Term, you will not be an employee of the Company and nothing in this letter shall be construed to create an employment relationship between you and the Company following the Separation Date. You recognize, acknowledge and agree that all income paid to you under this letter agreement shall constitute income from self-employment and you shall be required to pay self-employment taxes pursuant to Section 1401 of the Internal Revenue Code. You recognize, acknowledge and agree that the Company, its officers, directors, and employees shall have no obligation or liability whatsoever to you, your heirs, administrators, assigns, or creditors for workers compensation, federal and state payroll taxes, unemployment compensation, minimum wages, Social Security assessments or similar charges, taxes or liabilities applicable to an employment relationship.
7.
    
Future Cooperation.
In connection with any and all claims, disputes, negotiations, investigation, lawsuits or administrative proceedings involving the Company, you agree to make yourself available, upon reasonable notice from the Company, and without the necessity of subpoena, to provide information or documents, provide declarations or statements to the Company, meet with attorneys or other representatives of the Company, prepare for and give depositions or testimony, and/or otherwise cooperate in the investigation, defense or prosecution of any or all such matters. The Company will reimburse you for all documented, out-of-pocket expenses you incur in providing such cooperation to the Company. Any reimbursement payable pursuant to this section shall be paid as soon as administratively feasible upon your request. Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, you and the Company agree that the obligations imposed upon you under this section shall survive the expiration of the Term.

Restricted Activities
.
In connection with Executives promotion to President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Executive agrees that certain restrictions on his activities during and after his employment are necessary to protect the goodwill, confidential information and other legitimate interests of the Company and its affiliates:
(a)
    
While Executive is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, investor, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, compete with the business of the Company or any of its affiliates anywhere in the world where the Company or any of its affiliates is doing business or undertake any planning for competition with the Company or any of its affiliates. Specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, Executive agrees not to engage in any manner in any activity that is directly or indirectly competitive or potentially competitive with the business of the Company or any of its affiliates as conducted or under consideration at any time during Executives employment or to provide services in any capacity to a competitor of the Company or any of its affiliates. The business of the Company and its affiliates is the business of the Products. The foregoing condition, however, shall not fail to be met solely due to Executives passive ownership of less than 3% of the equity securities of any publicly traded company. For purposes of this Agreement, 
Products
 means all products planned, researched, developed, tested, manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or otherwise distributed or put into use by the Company or any of its affiliates, together with all services provided or planned by the Company or any of its affiliates, during Executives employment.

Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, and excluding any activities undertaken on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates in the course of his duties, he will not directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any customer of the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates; or directly
5
or indirectly solicit or encourage any customer or potential customer of the Company or any of its affiliates to conduct with any person any business or activity which such customer or potential customer conducts or could conduct with the Company or any of its affiliates.
(c)
    
Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, and excluding any activities undertaken on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates in the course of his duties, he will not directly or indirectly hire or otherwise engage the services of any employee, independent contractor or other agent providing services to the Company or any of its affiliates or solicit any such employee, independent contractor or agent to terminate or diminish his/her/its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates; provided that this Section shall not restrict Executives right to solicit prospective employees, independent contractors or agents pursuant to a general advertisement not specifically directed at such persons and to hire any persons (other than any person who was a direct report of Executive during his employment) who respond thereto and (2) that the solicitation or hiring of any independent contractor that is not an individual and provides services to multiple clients shall not be a violation of this Section so long as such solicitation or hiring does not cause the independent contractor to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates.
(d)

Enforcement of Covenants

Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to this Section 6. Executive agrees that those restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its affiliates and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area. Executive further acknowledges that, were he to breach any of the covenants contained in this Section 6, the damage to the Company and its affiliates would be irreparable. Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by Executive of any of said covenants, without having to post bond. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of this Section 6 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law.

A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment that are considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Code Section 409A unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a termination, termination of employment or like terms shall mean separation from service.
It is the intention of the parties that no payment or entitlement pursuant to this Agreement will give rise to any adverse tax consequences to Executive under Code Section 409A and any guidance issued thereunder.

ARTICLE VI
EXECUTIVE COVENANTS
6.1
    
Restricted Activities
.
Executive agrees that certain restrictions on his activities during and after his employment are necessary to protect the goodwill, confidential information and other legitimate interests of the Company and its affiliates:
(a)
    
While Executive is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment (the Restricted Period), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, investor, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, compete with the business of the Company or any of its affiliates anywhere in the world where the Company or any of its affiliates is doing business or undertake any planning for competition with the Company or any of its affiliates. Specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, Executive agrees not to engage in any manner in any activity that is directly or indirectly competitive or potentially competitive with the business of the Company or any of its
5
affiliates as conducted or under consideration at any time during Executives employment or to provide services in any capacity to a competitor of the Company or any of its affiliates. The business of the Company and its affiliates is the business of the Products. The foregoing condition, however, shall not fail to be met solely due to Executives passive ownership of less than 3% of the equity securities of any publicly traded company. For purposes of this Agreement, 
Products
 means all products planned, researched, developed, tested, manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or otherwise distributed or put into use by the Company or any of its affiliates, together with all services provided or planned by the Company or any of its affiliates, during Executives employment.
For Executives obligations during the Restricted Period, the Company shall pay Executive at least fifty percent (50%) of his annual Base Salary. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the severance payment contemplated under Sections 4.3 and 4.4 is sufficient to satisfy the payment required under this Section 6.1(a), such that no additional payment shall be required under this Section 6.1(a). In the event Executives employment terminates for a reason that does not require a severance payment under Section 4.3 or 4.4, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to make any payment required under this Section 6.1(a). Within five (5) business days after notice to the other party of a termination of employment that will not require a severance pay obligation (e.g. a voluntary resignation or a termination for cause), the Company shall notify Executive whether the Company intends to continue payment of at least fifty percent (50%) of Executives annual Base Salary in accordance with this Section 6.1(a) and, if so, for what period of time. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days before the end of any salary extension as contemplated by this Section 6.1(a), the Company shall notify Executive whether the Company intends to further extend the salary payments (and thus extend the noncompetition obligations) and, if so, for what period of time. Any such elective payment may be made in installments or a lump sum.
(b)
    
Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, and excluding any activities undertaken on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates in the course of his duties, he will not directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any customer of the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates; or directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any customer or potential customer of the Company or any of its affiliates to conduct with any person any business or activity which such customer or potential customer conducts or could conduct with the Company or any of its affiliates.
(c)
    
Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, and excluding any activities undertaken on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates in the course of his duties, he will not directly or indirectly hire or otherwise engage the services of any employee, independent contractor or other agent providing services to the Company or any of its affiliates or solicit any such employee, independent contractor or agent to terminate or diminish his/her/its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates; provided that this Section shall not restrict Executives right to solicit prospective employees, independent contractors or agents pursuant to a general advertisement not specifically directed at such persons and to hire any persons (other than any person who was a direct report of Executive during his employment) who respond thereto and (2) that the solicitation or hiring of any independent contractor that is not an individual and provides services to multiple clients shall not be a violation of this Section so long as such solicitation or
6
hiring does not cause the independent contractor to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates.
(d)
    
Executive agrees that during his employment by the Company and thereafter he shall not disparage the Company or any of its affiliates, their management or their business or the Products.
6.2
    
Enforcement of Covenants

6.1
    
Restricted Activities

Executive agrees that certain restrictions on his activities during and after his employment are necessary to protect the goodwill, confidential information and other legitimate interests of the Company and its affiliates:
(a)
    
While Executive is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment (the Restricted Period), Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, whether as owner, partner, investor, consultant, agent, employee, co-venturer or otherwise, compete with the business of the Company or any of its affiliates anywhere in the world where the Company or any of its affiliates is doing business or undertake any planning for competition with the Company or any of its affiliates. Specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, Executive agrees not to engage in any manner in any activity that is directly or indirectly competitive or potentially competitive with the business of the Company or any of its affiliates as conducted or under consideration at any time during Executives employment or to provide services in any capacity to a competitor of the Company or any of its affiliates. The business of the Company and its affiliates is the business of the Products. The foregoing condition, however, shall not fail to be met solely due to Executives passive ownership of less than 3% of the equity securities of any publicly traded company. For purposes of this Agreement, 
Products
 means all
5
products planned, researched, developed, tested, manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or otherwise distributed or put into use by the Company or any of its affiliates, together with all services provided or planned by the Company or any of its affiliates, during Executives employment.
For Executives obligations during the Restricted Period, the Company shall pay Executive at least fifty percent (50%) of his annual Base Salary. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the severance payment contemplated under Sections 4.3 and 4.4 is sufficient to satisfy the payment required under this Section 6.1(a), such that no additional payment shall be required under this Section 6.1(a). In the event Executives employment terminates for a reason that does not require a severance payment under Section 4.3 or 4.4, the Company may elect, in its sole discretion, to make any payment required under this Section 6.1(a). Within five (5) business days after notice to the other party of a termination of employment that will not require a severance pay obligation (e.g. a voluntary resignation or a termination for cause), the Company shall notify Executive whether the Company intends to continue payment of at least fifty percent (50%) of Executives annual Base Salary in accordance with this Section 6.1(a) and, if so, for what period of time. No later than fourteen (14) calendar days before the end of any salary extension as contemplated by this Section 6.1(a), the Company shall notify Executive whether the Company intends to further extend the salary payments (and thus extend the noncompetition obligations) and, if so, for what period of time. Any such elective payment may be made in installments or a lump sum.
(b)
    
Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, and excluding any activities undertaken on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates in the course of his duties, he will not directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any customer of the Company or any of its affiliates to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates; or directly or indirectly solicit or encourage any customer or potential customer of the Company or any of its affiliates to conduct with any person any business or activity which such customer or potential customer conducts or could conduct with the Company or any of its affiliates.
(c)
    
Executive agrees that, while he is employed by the Company, and for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of termination of such employment, and excluding any activities undertaken on behalf of the Company or any of its affiliates in the course of his duties, he will not directly or indirectly hire or otherwise engage the services of any employee, independent contractor or other agent providing services to the Company or any of its affiliates or solicit any such employee, independent contractor or agent to terminate or diminish his/her/its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates; provided that this Section shall not restrict Executives right to solicit prospective employees, independent contractors or agents pursuant to a general advertisement not specifically directed at such persons and to hire any persons (other than any person who was a direct report of Executive during his employment) who respond thereto and (2) that the solicitation or hiring of any independent contractor that is not an individual and provides services to multiple clients shall not be a violation of this Section so long as such solicitation or hiring does not cause the independent contractor to terminate or diminish its relationship with the Company or any of its affiliates.
6
(d)
    
Executive agrees that during his employment by the Company and thereafter he shall not disparage the Company or any of its affiliates, their management or their business or the Products.
6.2
    
Enforcement of Covenants

Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to this Section 6. Executive agrees that those restraints are necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the Company and its affiliates and that each and every one of the restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area. Executive further acknowledges that, were he to breach any of the covenants contained in this Section 6, the damage to the Company and its affiliates would be irreparable. Executive therefore agrees that the Company, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by Executive of any of said covenants, without having to post bond. The parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of this Section 6 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law.

It is the intention of the parties that no payment or entitlement pursuant to this Agreement will give rise to any adverse tax consequences to Executive under Code Section 409A and any guidance issued thereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted, applied and (to the minimum extent necessary) amended so that it does not fail to meet, and is operated in accordance with, the requirements of that Section. Any reference in this Agreement to Code Section 409A shall also include any proposed, temporary or final regulations, or any other guidance, promulgated with respect to that Section by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service.
