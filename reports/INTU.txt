ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.
Completed Acquisition of American Fundware, Inc.
As previously announced on May 9, 2002, Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") signed a definitive agreement to acquire Denver-based The Flagship Group. The Flagship Group is the holding company of American Fundware, Inc., a leading provider of accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations, universities and individual government agencies. The transaction closed on May 31, 2002.
American Fundware will operate as a separate business unit, Intuit Public Sector Solutions, based in Denver. The unit is led by Michael Potts, who was the chief executive officer of American Fundware, and will continue to offer its current products and services under the Intuit Fundware brand.
Intuit acquired all of the outstanding shares of The Flagship Group for approximately $22 million in Intuit stock and $4 million in cash.
Proposed Acquisition of Management Reports, Inc.
On June 4, 2002, Intuit announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Management Reports, Inc. ("MRI"), a leading provider of business management software solutions for commercial and residential property managers.
Intuit currently plans to operate MRI as a separate business unit led by Bob Lasser, MRI's Chief Executive Officer, and will offer MRI's current products and services using both the Intuit and MRI brands. MRI's products include MRI for Windows and MRI for the Web. Lasser will become a vice president at Intuit reporting to Steve Bennett, Intuit's chief executive officer, and virtually all of MRI's 300 employees will be asked to stay with the business. MRI will continue to be based in Cleveland.
Under the terms of the agreement, Intuit will acquire the outstanding shares of MRI for approximately $92 million in cash. Intuit expects MRI to contribute between $45 million and $50 million in revenue in fiscal year 2003, which begins August 1, 2002, and expects it to be slightly accretive to pro forma earnings per share in fiscal 2003. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of Intuit's fiscal 2002 (May 1, 2002  July 31, 2002), so the company does not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on fiscal 2002 results. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of MRI's shareholders.
Completed Acquisition of CBS Payroll, Inc.
As previously announced on May 8, 2002, Intuit signed a definitive agreement to acquire Fort Worth-based CBS Employer Services, Inc., the parent company of CBS Payroll, one of the leading privately held full-service outsourced payroll companies. The transaction closed on June 7, 2002.
Intuit has combined CBS Payroll's payroll services with its existing outsourced payroll services business with Micheal Sykes, who was CBS Payroll's chief executive officer, running the combined business.
Intuit acquired the outstanding shares of CBS Payroll for approximately $78 million. Approximately $74.5 million was paid in cash and the remainder was paid in Intuit stock.

Proposed Divestiture of Quicken Loans Business
On June 20, 2002, Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its Quicken Loans mortgage business. When the transaction closes, Quicken Loans will become a wholly owned subsidiary of a newly created company and will continue to offer residential home mortgages and home equity loans under the Quicken Loans brand. The new company's investors will be led by Dan Gilbert, chairman of Quicken Loans and founder of Rock Financial Corp. (the predecessor of Quicken Loans), which Intuit acquired in December 1999.
Based on the terms of the agreement, Intuit will receive cash, a note and multi-year licensing fees in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of Intuit's Quicken Loans Inc. and Title Source Inc. subsidiaries. Intuit will also receive a 12.5 percent equity interest in the new company. The new company will license from Intuit use of the Quicken Loans trademark for its residential home loan and home equity loan products. In addition, the two parties have entered into a five-year distribution agreement through which Quicken Loans will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. Intuit has also agreed to continue providing a line of credit to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months after the transaction closes. Such funding is customary in the mortgage origination market.
Intuit expects to treat the sale of the Quicken Loans business as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes. Accordingly, after the closing Intuit will amend its financial results for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 to reflect the exclusion of the results of the discontinued business.
Intuit purchased the Quicken Loans business in December 1999. Because the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests, Intuit's current balance sheet reflects the current net value of the tangible assets it acquired, rather than the purchase price paid. Accordingly, there will be no write-off of intangible assets (such as goodwill) associated with the sale of the business. Intuit expects to recognize a small gain on divestiture that will be reflected in its GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial results, because the consideration Intuit will receive exceeds the book value of the assets being sold. The transaction is expected to close within 90 days. The closing of the transaction is subject to standard closing conditions, including but not limited to various regulatory approvals.

Proposed Acquisition of Eclipse, Inc.
On June 27, 2002, Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Eclipse, Inc. ("Eclipse"), a leading provider of business management software solutions for wholesale durable goods distributors.
Intuit currently plans to operate Eclipse as a separate business unit led by Michael London, an Eclipse founder and its president and chief executive officer, and will offer Eclipse's current products and services using both the Intuit and Eclipse brands. London will become a vice president at Intuit reporting to Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer, and virtually all of Eclipse's 220 employees will be asked to stay with the business, including the company's other five founders. Eclipse will continue to be based in Shelton, Connecticut.
Under the terms of the agreement, Intuit will acquire substantially all of Eclipse's assets for approximately $85 million in cash. Intuit expects Eclipse to contribute between $40 million and $50 million in revenue in fiscal year 2003 and expects it to be slightly accretive to pro forma earnings per share in fiscal 2003. The acquisition is expected to close near the end of the fourth quarter of Intuit's fiscal 2002 (May 1, 2002  July 31, 2002) or in early fiscal 2003, so the company does not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on fiscal 2002 results. The closing of the transaction is subject to standard closing conditions, including but not limited to various regulatory approvals.

ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
     On July 31, 2002, Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") completed the sale of its Quicken Loans mortgage business to BRFC LLC ("BRFC"). The sale was structured as the transfer by Intuit of all of the capital stock of Quicken Loans Inc. and Title Source, Inc., both wholly owned subsidiaries of Intuit, to Rock Acquisition Corporation ("Rock"), a newly-created corporation, and the subsequent sale by Intuit of all of the voting stock of Rock to BRFC, which represented 87.5% of the common stock outstanding. In advance of completion of the sale, Quicken Loans Inc. and Title Source, Inc. repaid to Intuit all outstanding intercompany balances as well as paid out the net tangible shareholders' equity in excess of $33 million to Intuit. Consideration for the sale included $33 million from BRFC and a promissory note in the principal amount of $23.3 million from Rock. The promissory note is secured by all the assets of Rock, Quicken Loans and Title Source. Intuit retained nonvoting stock of Rock representing a 12.5% interest in Rock. In addition, Intuit agreed to continue providing a line of credit of up to $375 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months after the closing of the sale. Intuit will earn market interest rates on the outstanding balances under the line of credit, which is secured by all of the assets of Rock, Quicken Loans and Title Source.
Other Relationships
     Quicken Loans has also licensed from Intuit the right to use the Quicken Loans trademark for its residential home loan and home equity loan products and agreed to pay an annual license fee. Quicken Loans and Intuit entered into a five-year distribution agreement through which Quicken Loans will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com for an annual license fee. Daniel R. Gilbert, a managing member of BRFC, served as Vice President, Quicken Loans, from December 1999 to February 2002 and as an executive officer of Intuit from March 2000 to February 2002. William Emerson, also a member of BRFC, served as Vice President, Quicken Loans, and an executive officer of Intuit from February 2002 to July 31, 2002.
Accounting Treatment
     Intuit preliminarily estimates that it will recognize a gain for accounting purposes of $23.3 million on the sale. The amount of the gain is subject to change based on the final audited tangible shareholders' equity position as of the final consummation date and accordingly this amount may change. Intuit purchased the Quicken Loans business in December 1999. Because the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests, the value of the business was reflected on Intuit's balance sheet as the net value of the tangible assets, rather than the purchase price paid. The gain represents the premium over the net value of the tangible assets.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2001 gives effect to the disposition of Quicken Loans as if it had occurred on August 1, 2000, and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations for the nine months ended April 30, 2002 gives effect to the disposition of Quicken Loans as if it had occurred on August 1, 2001.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statements of Operations do not purport to represent what Intuit's results of operations would actually have been if the disposition had occurred on August 1, 2000 or August 1, 2001, and do not purport to project the results of operations of Intuit for the current year or for any future period. The adjustments in the pro forma financial information are based on available information and on assumptions which management believes are reasonable.

Seller will include the income of each of Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source (including any deferred income triggered into income by Sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 of the Treasury Regulations and any excess loss account(s) taken into income under Section 1.1502 19 of the Treasury Regulations) on the Group's consolidated federal income returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal income taxes attributable to such income. The parties will not elect to apportion the income of Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source between the period through the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date other than by closing the books of Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source as of the end of the Closing Date.
               6.5.4 Liability For Taxes  Periods Commencing On or Before the Closing Date and Ending After the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by law, Seller and Buyer shall elect to terminate all taxable periods with respect to Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source as of the Closing Date.

               6.5.5 Filing of Tax Returns. Seller shall timely prepare and file all tax returns with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes, except Tax Returns for taxes due or payable with respect to a Straddle Period. The income, deductions and credits with respect to Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source on such returns shall be computed consistent with past practices, principles and methods and shall be determined on the basis of the appropriate permanent records of Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source. Before filing any such return, Seller shall submit such return to Buyer for review, but Buyer's approval of such returns shall not be required. Buyer shall timely prepare and file all tax returns for taxes due or payable with respect to a Straddle Period and shall provide Seller with copies of any such tax return and a statement certifying the amount of taxes shown on such tax return that are Pre-Closing Taxes (a "Tax Statement") at least 15 days before the due date for the filing of such tax return. Seller and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review and approve such tax returns and Tax Statement, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed. Seller shall pay to Buyer within 30 days of receipt of a completed tax return and Tax Statement an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Taxes shown on such Tax Statement, unless Seller has disputed such amount. If Seller has disputed such amount, then Seller and Buyer shall resolve such dispute in the same manner as described in Section 1.1.4(b) for resolving disputes regarding the Amounts. Buyer shall timely prepare and file all tax returns with respect to Post-Closing Taxes. Within 15 days after Buyer's request, Seller shall provide such information and other data as Buyer may reasonably request in order to prepare and file all tax returns relating to any Straddle Period or any Post-Closing Taxes, or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any Straddle Period or any Post-Closing Taxes, or otherwise to enable Buyer to satisfy its accounting and tax requirements.
 
               6.5.6 [ * ].
               6.5.7 [ * ].
               6.5.8 Mutual Cooperation. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 15 days after Seller's request, Buyer shall deliver to Seller such information and other data relating to the tax returns and taxes of Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source and shall make available such knowledgeable employees of Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source as Seller may reasonably request, including providing the information and other data customarily required by Seller, to cause the completion and filing of all tax returns relating to Pre-Closing Taxes or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any Pre-Closing Taxes or otherwise to enable Seller to satisfy its accounting and tax requirements. As soon as practicable, but in any event within 15 days after Buyer's request, Seller shall deliver to Buyer such information and other data relating to the tax returns and taxes of Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source and shall make available such knowledgeable employees of Seller as Buyer may reasonably request, including providing the information and other data customarily required by Buyer, to cause the completion and filing of all tax returns relating to Post-Closing Taxes or to respond to audits by any taxing authorities with respect to any Post-Closing Taxes or otherwise to enable Buyer to satisfy its accounting and tax requirements.
               6.5.9 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any tax sharing agreement between Seller and any (or all) of Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source is and shall be terminated as of the Closing Date, and will have no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future year or a past year).
               6.5.10 Purchase Price to Acquire Shares. Buyer and Seller agree that the Purchase Price is being paid solely to acquire the Shares and neither party will, or will permit any affiliate to, report or treat any part of the Purchase Price as allocable to anything other than payment for the Shares.
               6.5.11 Resolution of Disagreements. If Seller and Buyer disagree as to the amount of taxes for which each is liable under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall resolve such disagreement in the same manner as described in Section 1.1.4(b) for resolving disputes regarding the Amount.
 
     6.6 No Disclosures. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall make any public disclosure or publicity release pertaining to the existence or subject matter of this Agreement without the consent of the other party, except that the parties and their directors, officers, employees and agents shall be permitted to make such disclosures that counsel advises them is required to comply with applicable law or stock exchange or market requirements, including securities laws and rules and state regulatory law, or that is required to comply with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, filing requirements or further information requests. The parties shall consult with each other and, except as permitted by the preceding sentence, agree on the desirability, timing and substance of any press release or public announcement or other disclosures to the public relating to the transactions described in this Agreement. This Section shall not apply to the requirement to agree on the desirability and timing of (but they still must agree on the substance of) (1) Buyer's notices required by Section 6.9, or (2) Seller's disclosure that Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source are no longer affiliates of Seller to parties that have contracts with Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source or that relate to the Mortgage Marketspace and with respect to which Seller is a party, is a guarantor or otherwise has liability.
     6.7 Restrictions on Stock Sales. Seller acknowledges that the Non-Voting Common Shares it receives from Buyer will not be registered under the Act or any applicable state or foreign securities laws. They will, therefore, be restricted securities. In addition to any other restriction on the sale of Non-Voting Common Shares applicable to Seller, Seller shall not pledge, hypothecate, sell or otherwise transfer any Non-Voting Common Shares acquired by it from Buyer except (1) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act, or (2) pursuant to applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and the appropriate blue sky laws. Buyer may place a legend on the certificates representing Non-Voting Common Shares setting forth such restriction. Buyer acknowledges that the Shares deliverable pursuant to this Agreement will not be registered under the Act or any applicable state or foreign securities laws. They are, therefore, restricted securities. In addition to any other restriction on the sale of Shares applicable to Buyer, Buyer shall not pledge, hypothecate, sell or otherwise transfer any Shares acquired by it under this Agreement except (1) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act, or (2) pursuant to applicable exemptions from registration under the Act and the appropriate blue sky laws.
     6.8 Access to Records. With respect to any books, records and files retained by Seller relating to the business of Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source, or the books, records and files delivered to the control of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement to the extent they related to the operations of Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source before the Closing Date, each party, at its expense, shall have the right, upon prior notice, to inspect and to make copies of such books, records and files at any time during normal business hours for any proper purpose. Buyer and Seller shall not destroy or allow the destruction of any such books, records and files for a period of six years following the Closing Date; provided, however, if either party wishes to destroy any of such books, records or files prior to the end of such period, then such party shall first offer in writing to deliver them to the other party.
 
     6.9 Notification of Change of Control. Buyer shall, within 45 days from the Closing Date, notify all vendors to, suppliers to and any person that extends credit to Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source, in each case which are parties that have contracts with Holding, Quicken Loans or Title Source and with respect to which Seller is a party, is a guarantor or otherwise has liability, that Holding, Quicken Loans and Title Source are no longer subsidiaries of Seller.

The exhibits to this Agreement are a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full in this Agreement.
     8.7 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision, is for any reason and to any extent determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted such so as reasonably to give effect to the intent of the parties to this Agreement.

The waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement or default in the performance of this Agreement will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any
 
other default or any succeeding breach or default. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement will not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to enforce such provisions. The rights and remedies of any party arising out of, or otherwise in respect of, any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall in no way be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of facts upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or exhibit contained in this Agreement (or in any other agreement between the parties) as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.
     8.9 Binding Effect; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to this Agreement and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Neither Buyer nor Seller may assign or transfer any of their rights or delegate any of their obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, and any purported assignment or transfer by Buyer or Seller without such consent shall be void; provided that, before the Closing Date, Buyer may assign or transfer any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement to any other person or entity without Seller's consent.
     8.10 Absence of Third Party Beneficiary Rights.

     8.11 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF BUYER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

To the full extent permitted by applicable law, interest shall continue to accrue on this Note after the filing by or against the Borrower of any petition seeking any relief in bankruptcy or under any act or law pertaining to insolvency or debtor relief, whether state, federal or foreign. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Loan Agreement.
     Principal Repayment. The outstanding principal balance of this Note shall be repaid as set forth in the Loan Agreement.

     Payment of Interest. Borrower shall pay to Intuit interest on the daily outstanding principal balance of the Loan at a variable per annum rate equal to the Applicable Base Rate in effect from time to time.
     Calculation of Interest. Interest shall be calculated by determining the daily outstanding amounts for Advances, and applying the applicable interest rate as set forth above to such Advances. Collateral Custodian's and Intuit's records shall be conclusive evidence of the proper calculation of interest due, absent manifest error.
     Payments. All principal and interest hereunder are payable in lawful money of the United States of America at the office of the Lender at the address shown above in immediately available funds and shall be made as set forth in Section 2 of the Loan Agreement.
     Late Payment Fee. A late payment charge of five percent (5%) of each late payment may be charged on any payment not received by Intuit within ten (10) calendar days after payment is due.
     Default Rate of Interest. During the continuance of any Event of Default for up to but not more than thirty (30) days, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender additional interest on the unpaid principal balance of the Note and, to the extent permitted by law, on any overdue installments of interest, at a rate
 
per annum equal to the stated interest rate under this Note plus 4%, or, during the continuance of any Event of Default that continues for more than 30 days, at a rate per annum equal to the stated interest rate under this Note plus 6%. Interest shall continue to accrue on the unpaid principal balance even if all sums due hereunder are accelerated and reduced to judgment.
     Waivers.

     "Secured Obligations" means all obligations and Indebtedness of the Borrower owing to the Lender under the Loan Agreement or any other Lender Agreement, including, without limitation, the obligation to pay the Indebtedness evidenced by this Note, and obligation to pay interest, fees, charges, expenses and indemnification under any Lender Agreement.
     Cross-Defaults. The occurrence or existence of an Event of Default under and as defined in the Loan Agreement or in any other documents, agreements or instruments securing and/or evidencing this Indebtedness shall constitute a default under this Note and shall entitle the Lender to accelerate the entire Indebtedness hereunder and take any other action provided for in any such agreements.

All agreements between the Borrower and the Lender are hereby expressly limited so that in no event shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use or forbearance of the Indebtedness exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law, except to the extent such maximum may be, and effectively is, waived by the Borrower in the Loan Agreement and/or this Note. If fulfillment of any provision hereof or of the Loan Agreement shall involve transcending the highest lawful rate of interest, then, , the interest rate on that obligation shall be reduced to the highest lawful rate, and if the Lender receives interest that exceeds the highest lawful rate, such excess interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest (except to the extent such limitations on the charging of interest are effectively waived by the Borrower). As used herein, the term "applicable law" means the New York law in effect as of the date hereof, provided, however, that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Note shall be governed by such new law as of its effective date.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Debtor shall remain obligated and liable under each contract or agreement comprised in the Collateral to be observed or performed by the Debtor thereunder. The Secured Party shall not have any obligation or liability under any such contract or agreement by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Secured Party of any payment relating to any of the Collateral, nor shall the Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of Debtor under or pursuant to any such contract or agreement. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession, the Secured Party shall have no duty to collect, preserve or to protect the Collateral or preserve rights against prior parties under Section 9-207 of the Uniform Commercial Code of the State or otherwise. The Secured Party agrees to release its security interest in any item or items of Collateral which Debtor disposes of pursuant to and as permitted by the Guaranty and to execute such agreements and documents as the Debtor may reasonably request to evidence such release.
12. Securities and Deposits. From and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Secured Party may at any time, at its option, transfer to itself or any nominee any securities constituting Collateral, receive any income thereon and hold such income as additional Collateral or apply it to the Obligations. From and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Secured Party may demand, sue for, collect, or make any settlement or compromise which it deems desirable with respect to the Collateral. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other
 
agreement, in no event shall either Debtor or the Secured Party exercise any right to setoff mutual obligations.
13. Notification to Account Debtors and Other Persons Obligated on Collateral. From and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (a) Debtor shall, at the request and option of the Secured Party, notify account debtors and other persons obligated on any of the Collateral of the security interest of the Secured Party in any account, chattel paper, general intangible, instrument or other Collateral and that payment thereof is to be made directly to the Secured Party or to any financial institution designated by the Secured Party as the Secured Party's agent therefor, and (b) the Secured Party may itself, without notice to or demand upon the Debtor, so notify account debtors and other persons obligated on Collateral. After the appropriate making of such a request or the appropriate giving of any such notification, the Debtor shall hold any proceeds of collection of accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles, instruments and other Collateral received by the Debtor as trustee for the Secured Party without commingling the same with other funds of the Debtor and shall turn the same over to the Secured Party in the identical form received, together with any necessary endorsements or assignments. To the extent permitted by this Agreement, the Secured Party shall apply the proceeds of collection of accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles, instruments and other Collateral received by the Secured Party to the Obligations, such proceeds to be immediately credited after final payment in cash or other immediately available funds of the items giving rise to them.

16. Reserved.
17. No Waiver. No party shall be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies in respect of the Obligations or the Collateral unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by such party. No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion. All rights and remedies of the parties whether evidenced hereby or by any other instrument or papers, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly, alternatively, successively or concurrently at such time or at such times as the applicable party deems expedient.

The Secured Party shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully may, Debtor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the
 
Secured Party's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, Debtor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.
20. Proceeds of Dispositions; Expenses. Debtor shall pay to the Secured Party on demand any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by the Secured Party in protecting, preserving or enforcing the Secured Party's rights and remedies under or in respect of any of the Obligations or any of the Collateral.

17. No Waiver. No party shall be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies in respect of the Obligations or the Collateral unless such waiver shall be in writing and signed by such party. No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy or any other right or remedy. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion.

To the extent that it lawfully may, each Debtor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshalling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the Secured Party's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Obligations or under which any of the Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Debtor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.
20. Proceeds of Dispositions; Expenses. The Debtors shall pay to the Secured Party on demand any and all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by the Secured Party in protecting, preserving or enforcing the Secured Party's rights and remedies under or in respect of any of the Obligations or any of the Collateral. After deducting all of said expenses, the residue of any proceeds of collection or sale or other disposition of the Collateral shall, to the extent actually received in cash, be applied to the payment of the Obligations in such order or preference as is provided in the Loan Agreement, proper allowance and provision being made for any Obligations not then due.

July 31, 2002
Ms. Connie Berg, Assistant Treasurer Intuit Inc. 2700 Coast Avenue Mountain View, CA 94043
Dear Ms Berg:
This letter confirms Protiviti Inc.'s ("Protiviti") arrangements to provide certain personnel to Intuit ("Client"). Protiviti shall provide to Client a Senior Consultant and Consultant (collectively, the "Personnel") to perform certain services relating to mortgage warehousing functions at Quicken Loans Inc.'s (the "Company") offices in Livonia, Michigan. The parties may increase, reduce or change the Personnel and/or Services by mutual written agreement.
Statement of Work:
The Personnel shall perform the following services ("Services") under Client's direction:
     See Attached Exhibit A.
The Personnel shall report directly and exclusively to Client, and Client shall be solely responsible for reviewing and approving any and all work performed by the Personnel. The Personnel shall observe Client's reasonable policies regarding working conditions and business hours, to the extent such policies are made known to the Personnel.
The Personnel will provide Services commencing on July 28, 2002, and will provide the Services until January 31, 2003, subject to the termination rights set forth below and further subject to a two-month minimum engagement (which two-month minimum shall include and not be in addition to the period of notice for termination). If, for any reason, any Personnel is unable to complete the service period, or if his (her) performance does not meet Client's expectations, Protiviti will endeavor to provide a suitable replacement who will be subject to Client's approval. If Protiviti is unable to identify a replacement acceptable to Client, the service period will be deemed to have automatically ended with respect to that individual.
Client shall pay Protiviti for the Services at the following rates:
     The rate for Senior Consultant's services will be $150 per hour.
     The rate for Consultant's services will be $100 per hour.
Client shall pay the amounts payable hereunder to Protiviti within thirty (30) days of receipt of invoices submitted by Protiviti. Invoices will be sent bi-weekly, and a closing invoice will be sent upon completion of the Services. In the event of any dispute with regard to a portion of an
 
invoice, the undisputed portion shall be paid as provided herein. Any invoices remaining unpaid when due shall accrue interest at a rate of 1.5% per month.
In addition, Client shall reimburse Protiviti for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Protiviti or any Personnel in connection with providing the Services in accordance with Protiviti's standard expense policies. The out-of-pocket expenses, which will include reasonable out of town living expenses, are estimated to be $1,600 per month; Client will provide copies of expense reports on request to Company.
In addition to the other responsibilities set forth in this agreement, Client shall cause on-site Personnel to be supplied with suitable office space, desks, storage, furniture and other normal office equipment support, including computer terminals, telephone service, postage, copying, typing, secretarial services and general office supplies which may be necessary in connection with Personnel's performance of the Services.
Employees of Protiviti who perform Services hereunder shall remain the employees of Protiviti. Protiviti shall be responsible for the tax withholdings, payment of salaries, unemployment insurance, workers' disability and compensation, social security contributions and employee benefits such as vacation, sick pay, insurance, pension and profit-sharing benefits of such Protiviti employees. In connection with this agreement, each party is an independent contractor and as such will not have any authority to bind or commit the other. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to create a joint venture, partnership or agency relationship between the parties for any purpose.
Client shall also be responsible for providing the Personnel with access to all individuals and tools reasonably necessary for the Personnel to perform the Services. Furthermore, it shall be Client's responsibility to obtain any and all consents from third parties required to permit and authorize such access, and Client shall indemnify Protiviti against any claims arising out of Client's failure to obtain any such consent.
The parties acknowledge that in the course of performance hereunder, the Personnel may use products, materials or methodologies proprietary to Protiviti or third parties. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Client shall not have or obtain any rights in such proprietary products, materials and methodologies of Protiviti or any third parties. This agreement shall not preclude Protiviti or the Personnel from providing any services to third parties, irrespective of their similarity to the Services delivered to Client pursuant to this agreement.
Client shall not solicit, hire or offer employment to any Personnel during the term of this agreement and for a period of one (1) year following the termination of this agreement, provided that public advertisements for employment to which Personnel respond directly will not be considered a violation of this provision. Any breach of this provision shall require Client to pay Protiviti an amount equal to one year's salary of each individual with respect to which a breach occurred.
 
Protiviti represents that the Personnel possess the general skills, knowledge and experience to perform the Services. If the performance of any of the Personnel demonstrates that such person does not possess the general skill, knowledge and experience to perform the Services, Protiviti shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client with a suitable replacement for such person promptly after Client provides Protiviti with a reasonable description of the performance problem.
The Personnel shall at all times conduct all operations under this agreement in a manner to avoid the risk of loss, theft, or damage by vandalism, sabotage or other means to the Collateral (as such Collateral is defined in Exhibit A). The Personnel shall promptly take all reasonable precautions which are necessary and adequate to protect against conditions which involve a risk of loss, theft or damage to the Collateral. The Personnel will observe Company's policies for non-disclosure and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information to which the Personnel have access during the engagement. As between Protiviti and Client, Protiviti is solely responsible for the safety of the Personnel.
Protiviti agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Client and its affiliates, and all of their respective officers, directors, agents and employees, harmless from and against any and all claims, including liabilities, actions, judgments, costs, and expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively "Claims"), asserted by a third party arising out of or related to: (i) any breach or alleged breach of any of Protiviti's obligations under this agreement; (ii) Protiviti's negligent acts, omissions and/or willful misconduct in supplying the Services under this agreement, or negligent acts, omissions and/or willful misconduct of the Personnel or any other employee or agent of Protiviti; or (iii) any obligations imposed by law with respect to any withholding taxes, social security, unemployment or disability insurance, or similar items in connection with any payments made to Protiviti for the rendering of Services hereunder. This provision shall survive the termination of this agreement for any reason. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, Protiviti's liability to Client under this agreement shall be limited to an amount not to exceed the fees paid to Protiviti by Client in the course of this engagement.
Protiviti will, at Protiviti's expense, maintain insurance policies that cover Protiviti's activities under this agreement and the activities of Protiviti's employees, agents and representatives, including, but not limited to workers compensation insurance in the statutory limit of $1 million; comprehensive general liability of $1 million per occurrence and $2 million annual aggregate; errors and omissions liability with minimum limits of $15 million; and media liability with minimum limits of $     . Protiviti will name Client as an additional insured on each such policy. Upon the request of Client, Protiviti shall provide Client with a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverages. In addition, Protiviti will provide Client thirty (30) days advance written notice of any cancellation or reduction in coverage or limits. Protiviti will provide Client with a fidelity bond covering the Personnel with coverage of not less than $5 million.
EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH PROTIVITI'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
 
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THAT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
Client will not use or in any way associate the name of Protiviti with any work or work product of any Personnel in any oral or written communication with a third party, other than Company (as defined in Exhibit A). Protiviti will not use or in any way associate the name of Client with any work or work product of any Personnel in any oral or written communication with a third party, other than Company.
Either party may terminate this agreement for any reason upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party. In the event of such termination, Client shall pay Protiviti for all Services rendered and expenses incurred by Protiviti prior to the date of termination.
This Agreement, to the extent it establishes legal rights and obligations between Protiviti and Client, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California.
This agreement represents the entire agreement between you and us and supersedes all other communications between the parties concerning Protiviti's providing personnel to Client to perform the Services.
We are pleased to have this opportunity to provide personnel to you.
Very truly yours,
Protiviti, Inc.

Statement of Work
     1. Appointment of Custodian. Protiviti shall provide the Personnel to act as bailee and custodian for the exclusive benefit of the Client with respect to the Collateral ("Custodian") and to perform duties in accordance with Client's instructions, from the Company's location in Livonia, Michigan, or at such other location as the Company shall maintain for the principal place of business of its mortgage lending operation. Custodian shall not deliver possession of Collateral to the Company except in accordance with Client's written instructions. Client will make reasonable efforts to ensure that notice to Custodian is timely given such that delivery or redelivery of Collateral to the Company as permitted by this Agreement is not delayed.
     2. Delivery of Required Documents, Review of Collateral.
     (a)  From time to time, the Company shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Custodian collateral consisting of Mortgage Loans ("Collateral"). Such delivery shall be effected by delivery of the Required Documents (as described in the Loan Agreement), not later than 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time on the first Business Day such Collateral is to be included in the computation of the Borrowing Base pursuant to the Loan Agreement.
     (b)  Within one (1) Business Day after receipt of Required Documents for any Collateral delivered by 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time on any Business Day, or within two (2) Business Days after receipt of Required Documents for any Collateral delivered after such time on any Business Day, Custodian shall review the same and verify that:
     (1)  The Required Documents relating to the Collateral appear regular on their face and are in the possession of Custodian;
 
     (2)  All submitted documents are consistent as to borrower name, property address, loan face amount (which does not exceed the face amount of the related promissory note), loan interest rate, loan type, loan term and Company's loan number;
     (3)  The note and mortgage/deed of trust each bear an original signature or signatures which appear to be those of the person or persons named as the maker and mortgagor/trustor, or, in the case of a certified copy of the mortgage/deed of trust, such copy bears what appears to be a reproduction of such signature or signatures; and
     (4)  The amount of each note and mortgage delivered to Custodian corresponds to advances made by Client to Company pursuant to the Loan Agreement.
If Custodian notes any exception to items (1), (2), (3) or (4) above, Custodian shall prepare a report noting such exception (an "Exception Report") and deliver it by facsimile or electronic transmission to the Client and the Company as soon as the review is complete but in no event later than 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on the next Business Day. The Collateral on the Exception Report shall not be included in the Borrowing Base until such exception is cured. Custodian shall be the arbiter of whether exceptions have been cured.
     (c)  Custodian shall prepare and deliver to Client at Client's request, daily, with a copy to Company, a report pertaining to the Collateral in Custodian's possession from time to time.
     3. Handling of Collateral.
     (a)  Except as otherwise provided herein, all Collateral at any time delivered to Custodian hereunder shall be held in a fire resistant vault, drawer or other suitable depository maintained and controlled solely by Custodian, conspicuously marked to show the interest therein of the Client, and Collateral shall not be commingled with any other assets or property of, or held by, Custodian.
     (b)  Custodian shall not release any item of Collateral from the security interest created hereby or by the Loan Documents without the prior consent of the Client, except as otherwise provided by this Agreement.
     (c)  Custodian may, provided no Event of Default is continuing, release documentation relating to Mortgage Loans to the Company against a Trust Receipt executed by the Company. Custodian will hold all Trust Receipts in the same manner as it holds other Collateral hereunder. The Company will not make any request for release of Collateral except for the purpose of correcting clerical or other documentation errors to the Mortgage Loans in anticipation of their sale to Investors.
     (d)  Custodian will release Mortgage Loans to Investors promptly upon request by Company provided that a copy of the Bailee Agreement in the form attached to the Loan Agreement as Exhibit A-4 accompanies the Mortgage Loans in all cases where the Mortgage Loans are released to Investors prior to receipt from such Investors of the purchase price for the Mortgage Loans. Payments by Investors of the purchase price for Mortgage Loans shall be wired to an account held by Client ("Account"). All amounts payable on account of the sale of Collateral will be paid directly by the Investor to the Account.
 
     4. Assistance to the Custodian. To the extent that Custodian's reporting or other duties under this Agreement reasonably require assistance from Company's staff, Company shall make its staff members available to Custodian to assist in the performance of Custodian's duties. Such assistance will be at the expense of Company.
     5. Reporting Duties of Custodian. Custodian shall have the right and obligation to report to Client daily on the Collateral received by Custodian, the funds received in the Account from Investors, the Requests for Advances received from Company, the Collateral requested to be released by Company, the Collateral released to Investors, and any other matter that Client deems reasonably necessary or desirable in connection with the Loan. To effectuate this reporting, Custodian shall have reasonable access to Company's books and records, including accounting records, and to Company's premises, employees and all other data and information used by Company in conducting its mortgage loan origination business. At Client's option, Custodian shall also have the right and obligation to make periodic reports on loan products, credit quality and other non-financial aspects of Company's operations, and Company shall provide Custodian reasonable access to its records, employees and other information for this purpose.
     6. Fees and Expenses of Protiviti. In consideration of Custodian's services provided hereunder, Company agrees to reimburse monthly to Client the fees and expenses incurred by Client as a result of Client's engagement of Protiviti, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month commencing thirty (30) days after Protiviti is appointed and serving, and continuing monthly until the Indebtedness is fully paid and the Client's security interest in all remaining Collateral is released.
     7. Replacement Custodian. The Client may replace Protiviti as Custodian at any time in its sole discretion; any such replacement Custodian shall have the same rights and responsibilities as the initial Custodian appointed hereunder; alternatively, the Client may act as Custodian itself, through any one or more of its employees, agents or officers, as it may in its sole discretion determine. Client will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the timing of the appointment of any substitute or replacement Custodian will not impede the business of the Company and will provide Company notice of the identity of any replacement Custodian.
     8. No Reliance. Except as set forth to the contrary hereunder, Custodian shall not be responsible for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained herein or in the Loan Agreement or any document, instrument or agreement made in connection with or securing or supporting the Indebtedness (the Loan Agreement and such documents, instruments and agreements shall each be referred to herein as a "Loan Document" and collectively as the "Loan Documents"), or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectability, accuracy, completeness or sufficiency of this Agreement or any Loan Document or instruments executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.
     9. Availability of Documents. During normal business hours, and upon notice to Company, the Client and its employees, officers, directors, agents, accountants, attorneys and auditors, and other parties with the express permission of Client, may examine the files, documents, records and other papers in the possession or under the control of Custodian relating to the Collateral, and may make copies thereof.
 
     10. Event of Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Custodian shall at the request and direction of the Client, without notice to or demand upon the Company, deliver the Collateral (or portions thereof and proceeds thereof) to the Client as provided in the Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     (a)  So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral and shall be entitled to receive any cash dividends or distributions paid or distributed in respect of the Collateral provided such dividends or distributions are applied to payments under the Note (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).
 
     (b)  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights or receive cash dividends or distributions that it would otherwise be entitled to exercise or receive, as applicable pursuant to Section 4(a), shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in Secured Party, who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting or other consensual rights and to receive and retain such cash dividends and distributions. Pledgor shall execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to Secured Party all such proxies and other instruments as Secured Party may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Secured Party to exercise the voting and other rights which it is entitled to exercise and to receive the dividends and distributions that it is entitled to receive and retain in each case pursuant to the preceding sentence.
     Pledgor hereby expressly authorizes Secured Party to file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the Collateral.
     Pledgor shall not change its jurisdiction of organization nor cease to be a corporation, in each case, without giving Secured Party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof.
     Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints Secured Party as Pledgor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of Pledgor and in the name of Pledgor, Secured Party or otherwise, from time to time at Secured Party's discretion from and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default to take any action and to execute any instrument that Secured Party may reasonably deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including: (i) receiving, endorsing and collecting all instruments made payable to Pledgor representing any dividend, interest payment or other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any part thereof to the extent permitted hereunder; or (ii) arranging for the transfer of the Collateral on the books of any of the issuers or any other Person to the name of Secured Party or to the name of Secured Party's nominee.
     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default:
     (a)  Secured Party may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the Code.
     (b)  Pledgor hereby acknowledges that the sale by Secured Party of any Collateral pursuant to the terms hereof in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933 as now in effect or as hereafter amended, or any similar statute hereafter adopted with similar purpose or effect (the "Securities Act"), as well as applicable "Blue Sky" or other state securities laws, may require strict limitations as to the manner in which Secured Party or any subsequent transferee of the Collateral may dispose thereof. Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that in order to protect Secured Party's interest it may be necessary to sell the Collateral at a price less than the maximum price attainable if a sale were delayed or were made in another manner, such as a public offering under the Securities Act. Pledgor agrees that, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, Secured Party may, subject to applicable law, from time to time attempt to sell all or any part of the Collateral by a private placement, restricting the bidders and prospective purchasers to those who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for
 
investment only and not for distribution. In so doing, Secured Party may solicit offers to buy the Collateral or any part thereof for cash, from a limited number of investors reasonably believed by Secured Party to be institutional investors or other accredited investors who might be interested in purchasing the Collateral.
     Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any cash held by Secured Party as Collateral and all cash Proceeds received by Secured Party in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by Secured Party of its remedies as a secured creditor shall be applied by Secured Party as provided in the Loan Agreement.
     Pledgor agrees to pay and reimburse Secured Party upon demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) that Secured Party may incur in connection with (i) the custody, use or preservation of, or the sale of, collection from or other realization upon, any of the Collateral, including the reasonable expenses of re-taking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling or otherwise disposing of or realizing on the Collateral, (ii) the exercise or enforcement of any rights or remedies granted hereunder, under the Guaranty, or otherwise available to it (whether at law, in equity or otherwise), or (iii) the failure by Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. The provisions of this Section shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the repayment of any of the Secured Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
     The powers conferred on Secured Party hereunder are solely to protect its interests in the Collateral and shall not impose on it any duty to exercise such powers. Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody and preservation of Collateral in its possession, the Secured Party shall have no duty to collect, preserve or protect the Collateral or preserve rights against prior parties.
     (a)  LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN THIS AGREEMENT, ITS CONSTRUCTION, AND THE DETERMINATION OF ANY RIGHTS, DUTIES OR REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT (REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE NEW YORK PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW). THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ANY CASE OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT ALL LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE COMMENCED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK OR IN ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY. EACH OF THE PARTIES CONSENTS TO BE SUBJECT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING THE FEDERAL COURTS IN NEW YORK.
     (b)  EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS ISSUED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING AND AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINT, OR OTHER PROCESS MAY BE MADE BY
 
REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO PLEDGOR AT ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETED UPON THE EARLIER OF PLEDGOR'S ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF OR THREE DAYS AFTER DEPOSIT IN THE UNITED STATES MAILS, PROPER POSTAGE PREPAID.
     (c)  NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED OR OPERATE TO AFFECT THE RIGHT OF SECURED PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW, OR TO PRECLUDE THE ENFORCEMENT BY SECURED PARTY OF ANY JUDGMENT OR ORDER OBTAINED IN SUCH FORUM OR THE TAKING OF ANY ACTION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO ENFORCE SAME IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE FORUM OR JURISDICTION.
     No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by any party herefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the other party, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.
     Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all notices to Pledgor under this Agreement shall be provided in the same manner as notices to BRFC LLC specified in Section 8.1 of the Purchase Agreement and all notices to Secured Party under this Agreement shall be provided in the same manner as notices to Secured Party specified in Section 8.1 of the Purchase Agreement.
     This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall: (a) remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment in full of the Secured Obligations; (b) be binding upon Pledgor and its successors and assigns; and (c) inure to the benefit of Secured Party and its successors, and permitted assigns.

Upon any such termination, Secured Party will, at Pledgor's expense, execute and deliver to Pledgor such documents as Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination. Such documents shall be prepared by Pledgor and shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Secured Party.
     To the maximum extent permitted by law, all rights of Secured Party, all security interests hereunder, and all obligations of Pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional irrespective of:
     (a)  any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Secured Obligations or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
     (b)  any change in the time, manner, or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any agreement or instrument relating to the Secured Obligations;
     (c)  any exchange, release, or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any guaranty for all or any of the Secured Obligations; or
     (d)  any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, Pledgor.
     Section and subsection headings in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement or be given any substantive effect. In this Agreement, the singular shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa; the document shall not be construed for or against either party, each party having had an opportunity to review it and have it reviewed by counsel.
     In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

INTUIT INC., a Delaware corporation
 
     THIS GUARANTY AND SURETY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of July 31, 2002 by Rock Acquisition Corporation, a Michigan corporation, and Title Source, Inc., a Michigan corporation, jointly and severally (collectively, the "Guarantors" and each a "Guarantor").
     Background. Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Intuit"), and Quicken Loans Inc., a Michigan corporation (the "Borrower"), have executed and delivered a certain Mortgage Warehousing Agreement dated the date hereof (the "Loan Agreement"). As an inducement to Intuit to enter into the Loan Agreement, the Guarantors have agreed, jointly and severally, to guarantee all Obligations (as defined below) of the Borrower and to execute and deliver this Guaranty and Surety Agreement. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Loan Agreement.
     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Guarantors hereby agree, jointly and severally, as follows:
     1. The Guarantors, jointly and severally, hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to Intuit and to its successors and permitted assigns, and become surety to Intuit and to its successors and permitted assigns for, the prompt and unconditional payment and performance of all obligations of the Borrower (including any trustee or debtor in possession of or for the Borrower) to Intuit arising out of or provided for in the Loan Agreement and the Security Agreement of even date herewith from the Borrower to Intuit (collectively, the "Related Documents") or under any renewals, extensions or modifications thereof, whether primary, secondary, direct, contingent, sole, joint, several or joint and several, including without limitation the payment of (i) the total amount of principal under the Loan Agreement, (ii) all interest, costs, charges, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees payable in accordance with the Loan Agreement as the same shall become due and payable (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and (iii) all other obligations of any kind owing from time to time by the Borrower under the terms of any Related Document (hereinafter referred to individually as an "Obligation" and collectively as "Obligations"). If any Obligation is not paid or performed by the Borrower punctually when due, subject to any applicable grace period, including without limitation any Obligation due by acceleration of the maturity thereof, the Guarantors will, upon Intuit's demand, immediately pay or perform such Obligation or cause the same to be paid or performed strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors, jointly and severally, will pay to Intuit, upon demand, all losses and reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, which Intuit may incur in the collection or enforcement of the Obligations or of the Guarantors' obligations under this Agreement. This is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collectibility.
     2. The Guarantors further hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agree and guarantee to make full and prompt payment to Intuit of any of the Obligations which Intuit is subsequently ordered or required to pay or disgorge on the grounds that such payments constituted an avoidable preference or a fraudulent transfer under applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or fraudulent transfer laws; and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall fully and promptly indemnify Intuit for all costs (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Intuit in defense of such claims of avoidable preference or fraudulent transfer. The Guarantors further agree, jointly and severally, to pay to Intuit, upon demand, all losses and reasonable costs and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
 
attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by Intuit in attempting to cause the Obligations to be satisfied or in attempting to cause satisfaction of the Guarantors' liability under this Agreement.
     3. The Guarantors hereby:
          (a) Assent to all terms of the Related Documents and all agreements hereafter made by the Borrower with Intuit;
          (b) Agree that Intuit may, without limitation and without modifying, limiting, releasing, discharging or otherwise affecting the Guarantors' obligations under this Agreement:
               (i) Exchange, release or surrender to the Borrower or to any guarantor, pledgor, or grantor any collateral, or waive, release or subordinate any security interest, in whole or in part, now or hereafter held as security for any of the Obligations;
               (ii) Waive or delay the exercise of any of its rights or remedies against the Borrower or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, the Guarantors or any other guarantor;
               (iii) Release the Borrower or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other guarantor;
               (iv) Renew, extend, or modify the terms of, any of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing the same; and
               (v) Apply payments by the Borrower, the Guarantors, or any other person or entity, to any of the Obligations;
          (c) Waive all notices whatsoever with respect to this Agreement or with respect to the Obligations, including, but without limitation, notice of:
               (i) Intuit's acceptance hereof or its intention to act, or its action, in reliance hereon;
               (ii) The present existence or future incurring of any of the Obligations or any terms or amounts thereof or any change therein;
               (iii) Any default by the Borrower or any surety, pledgor, grantor of security, or guarantor, including, without limitation, the Guarantors; and
               (iv) The obtaining or release of any guaranty or surety agreement (in addition to this Agreement), pledge, assignment, or other security for any of the Obligations.
     The Guarantors waive notice of presentment, demand, protest and notice of nonpayment, protest in relation to any instrument evidencing any of the Obligations, and any other demands and notices required by law, except as such waiver may be expressly prohibited by law.
     4. The liability of the Guarantors under this Agreement is absolute and unconditional, jointly and severally, primary, direct and immediate, without regard to the liability of any other person, and shall not in any manner be affected by reason of any action taken or not taken by Intuit, which action
 
or inaction is herein consented and agreed to, nor by the partial or complete unenforceability or invalidity of the Obligations or of any other guaranty or surety agreement, pledge, assignment or other security for any of the Obligations. No delay in making demand on a Guarantor for satisfaction of its liability hereunder shall prejudice Intuit's right to enforce such satisfaction. All of Intuit's rights and remedies shall be cumulative and any failure of Intuit to exercise any right hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of the right to exercise the same or any other right at any time, and from time to time, thereafter.
     5. The Guarantors hereby waive (i) all defenses to, and all setoffs, counterclaims and claims or recoupment against, the Obligations that may at any time be available to the Borrower and (ii) all other defenses under any applicable law that would, but for this clause (ii), be available to the Guarantors as a defense against or a reduction or limitation of its liabilities and obligations hereunder. This Agreement is a primary obligation of the Guarantors.
     6. Until the Obligations have been paid in full, all rights that the Guarantors may at any time have against the Borrower or any collateral for the Obligations by virtue of their obligation hereunder (including rights of subrogation, exoneration, reimbursement, indemnity and contribution and whether arising under applicable law or otherwise), are hereby expressly subordinated to the prior payment, observance and performance in full of the Obligations. No Guarantor shall enforce any of the rights, or attempt to obtain payment or performance of any of the obligations, subordinated pursuant to this Section 6 until the Obligations have been paid, observed and performed in full except that such prohibition shall not apply to routine acts, such as the giving of notices and the filing of continuation statements, necessary to preserve any such rights. If any amount shall be paid to or recovered by any Guarantor (whether directly or by the way of setoff, recoupment or counterclaim) on account of any right or obligation subordinated pursuant to this Section 6, such amount shall be held in trust by that Guarantor for the benefit of Intuit, not commingled with any of that Guarantor's other funds, and forthwith paid over to Intuit, in the exact form received, together with any necessary endorsements, to be applied and credited against, or held as security for, the Obligations and the obligations of that Guarantor hereunder.
     7. Each Guarantor makes the following agreements:

Proposed Acquisition of Blue Ocean Software
     On August 14, 2002, Intuit Inc. announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Blue Ocean Software Inc., a leading provider of software that helps small businesses manage their information technology resources and assets.
     Intuit currently plans to operate Blue Ocean as a business unit within its Small Business and Personal Finance division and will continue to offer Blue Ocean's current products and services. Russ Hobbs, Blue Ocean's chief executive officer, will lead the operating unit as a vice president at Intuit reporting to Lorrie Norrington, executive vice president, Small Business and Personal Finance. Virtually all of Blue Ocean's 78 employees will be asked to stay with the business. Blue Ocean will continue to be based in Tampa, Florida.
     Under the terms of the agreement, Intuit will acquire all outstanding shares of Blue Ocean's stock for approximately $170 million in cash. Intuit expects Blue Ocean to contribute approximately $45 million to $55 million in revenue in fiscal year 2003. The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The closing of the transaction is subject to standard closing conditions, including various regulatory approvals.
Press Release Announcing Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2002 Results
     Fiscal 2002 Results
     On August 14, 2002, Intuit announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2002. Intuit reported fiscal 2002 revenue of $1.36 billion, an increase of 18% over fiscal 2001 revenue of $1.15 billion. Intuit reported net income for the year of $140.2 million, or $0.64 per share, up from a net loss of $82.8 million, or a net loss of $0.40 per share, in fiscal 2001. Growth was driven by strong performance in Intuit's largest businesses  small business and tax. In fiscal 2002, losses related to marketable securities decreased by $82.5 million compared to fiscal 2001 and acquisition-related charges decreased by $66.6 million compared to fiscal 2001. Intuit sold its Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002. Quicken Loans is treated as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes. As a result, the financial results for Quicken Loans, reflecting income and expenses totaling $47.1 million, were segregated into a separate line item rather than reflected in Intuit's operating results.
     Fourth Quarter Results
     Intuit reported revenue of $197.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, an increase of 31% over the $150.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Growth was driven primarily by strong results in QuickBooks and Canada. Intuit reported a net loss for the quarter of $31.8 million, or a loss of $0.15 per share. Intuit typically reports a loss in its fourth quarter when revenue from tax preparation businesses is minimal, but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, Intuit reported a net loss of $61.3 million, or a loss of $0.29 per share. The smaller loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 was due in part to the gain on the sale of Quicken Loans of $23.3 million. Intuit acquired Quicken Loans in December 1999. Because the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests, the value of the business was reflected on Intuit's balance sheet as the net value of the tangible assets, rather than the purchase price paid. The gain represents the premium over the net value of the tangible assets.

Announcement of Fiscal 2003 First Quarter Results
On November 13, 2002, Intuit Inc. announced the results for its first quarter of fiscal 2003, which ended October 31, 2002. Revenue increased 32 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2002 to $223.3 million. Intuit narrowed its seasonal net loss to $54.7 million, or $0.26 per share. This is down significantly from a net loss of $92.4 million, or $0.44 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Intuit typically reports a loss in its first quarter when revenue from its tax preparation businesses is minimal, but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels. Two factors contributed to the lower loss: lower acquisition-related charges due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's SFAS 142 and the absence of a charge for impairment of long-lived assets.

ITEM 9.    REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
On December 3, 2002, Intuit Inc. confirmed its current fiscal year 2003 guidance. The reiterated guidance is:
 
 
Intuit first announced this guidance on November 13, 2002 when the company reported its operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
 
.The pro forma information above is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). It is presented for informational purposes only, to give investors an alternative method of assessing the results of the company's core operating businesses. This pro forma information should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP financial information. The company's pro forma information is presented using the same consistent standards from quarter to quarter and year to year. Because there are no generally accepted industry standards for presenting pro forma results, the method Intuit uses may differ from the methods used by other companies. In addition, pro forma presentations are a current topic of proposed SEC rules. These rules may change the way in which we present our non-GAAP financial information.
Pro Forma Accounting
    
 
Company pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangible assets and impairment charges, and amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. It also excludes loss on impairment of long-lived asset, gains and losses from marketable securities and other investments, net gains and losses on divestitures, discontinued operations and the tax effects of these transactions.
 
.    Intuit's guidance constitutes a forward-looking statement about future financial results. Actual results may differ materially from Intuit's expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future. We will not update our guidance if it later turns out to be inaccurate, except as required by law. Risks and uncertainties that may affect future results and performance include, but are not limited to, those described below. More details about these and other risks are included in our fiscal 2002 Form 10-K and other SEC filings.

Announcement of Fiscal 2003 Second Quarter Results
 
On February 13, 2003, Intuit Inc. announced the results for its second quarter of fiscal 2003, which ended January 31, 2003. Revenue of $558.1 million increased 17 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Intuit reported net income of $124.8 million, up 7 percent from net income of $119.9 million in the earlier period. This represents $0.60 per share, up 9 percent from $0.55 per share in the second quarter of 2002. Stronger revenue growth and lower acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2003 due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standard Board's SFAS 142 contributed to the year-over-year difference.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACTS: INVESTORS MEDIA Linda Fellows, VP, Treasurer Heather McLellan Intuit Inc. Intuit Inc. (650) 944-5436 (650) 944-3501 or Holly Anderson Sandhill Communications (615) 377-6902 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE INTUIT UPDATES FISCAL 2003 GUIDANCE Company Lowers Growth Projections in Second Half of Fiscal 2003 Annual Revenue Now Expected to Grow 25-29 Percent over Fiscal 2002 MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. -- MARCH 20, 2003 -- Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) today announced that it has revised its fiscal 2003 guidance to reflect the impact of the nation's economic slowdown on its business. Intuit now expects revenue of $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion for the fiscal year ending in July 2003, which represents growth of approximately 25-29 percent over fiscal 2002. The company has taken appropriate action to realign costs with revenue and expects pro forma earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.35, or growth of 41-47 percent over the prior year. "Intuit continues to grow revenue and earnings at a faster pace than last year and each of our growth engines is still growing within its expected range," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Our share of retail sales for QuickBooks and TurboTax has remained steady and strong, but the categories are simply growing more slowly. "We're disappointed to see a sluggish economy worsening in the past few weeks with a further decrease in customer spending in all our categories. This is not an issue with just one of our businesses -- all our businesses have been affected. Consequently, we won't grow as fast as we'd originally projected." Intuit had expected that additional strength in its businesses would have offset the more than $20 million in second-half revenue that the company will not receive due to the recent sale of its Japanese subsidiary. This additional strength has not materialized.
Consumer tax is Intuit's largest revenue driver in its third quarter, which ends April 30. Intuit, along with others in the industry, has experienced a slower start to its consumer tax season this year. The company believes this has caused slower growth in the consumer tax category while TurboTax's share of retail season-to-date sales has remained steady at approximately 68 percent of units and nearly 77 percent of dollars(1). However, with three of the busiest weeks of the tax season still to come and with products and promotions that make it easy for consumers to do their taxes at the last minute, the company could benefit from stronger-than-expected season-end sales. Given the slower start and the impact of the economy on its other businesses, however, the company believes it's prudent to re-set expectations. COMPANY MAINTAINS GROWTH RANGES IN ALL FIVE GROWTH ENGINES Intuit has not changed the fiscal 2003 growth rate ranges for any of its five growth engines, but now expects to come in at the lower ends of the ranges. Those growth rate ranges are: - QuickBooks 20-30 percent revenue growth - Small Business Services 30+ percent revenue growth - TurboTax 20-30 percent revenue growth - Professional Accounting Solutions 10-15 percent revenue growth - Business Verticals 10-30 percent revenue growth UPDATED GUIDANCE "Despite the economy and overall business conditions, we still expect another strong year at Intuit, with revenue growth of at least 25 percent and pro forma operating income growth of at least 44 percent," said Bennett.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Intuit's prior guidance for fiscal 2003 revenue was $1.71 billion to $1.77 billion, or growth of 30 percent to 35 percent. Because of the seasonal nature of its business, most of the slower revenue growth should occur in the third quarter. Prior guidance for fiscal 2003 pro forma operating income was $419 million to $434 million, or growth of 53-59 percent. Prior guidance for fiscal 2003 pro forma EPS was $1.38 to $1.42, or growth of 50-54 percent. The company's policy is to not confirm, update or otherwise comment on its financial projections except in compliance with Regulation FD. See Cautions about Forward-Looking Statements below. Intuit always reports pro forma performance to provide investors with an alternative method for assessing ongoing core operating results. Intuit's pro forma results are presented for information purposes only and use the same consistent methods from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income always excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. Pro forma results are not computed according to GAAP. Because there are no generally accepted industry standards for presenting pro forma results, the method Intuit uses may differ from the methods used by other companies. CAUTIONS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements about future financial results and other events that have not yet occurred, including guidance about Intuit's expected results for the remainder of fiscal 2003. Statements with words like "expects," "anticipates" or "believes," and statements in the future tense, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from Intuit's expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future. Some of the important factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ are listed below. More details about these and other risks are included in Intuit's fiscal 2002 Form 10-K and other SEC filings and at www.intuit.com/company/investors/considerations.html. The company does not intend to update the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate. - Seasonality causes significant quarterly fluctuations in Intuit's revenue and net income. - The increased use of Intuit's web-based consumer tax products and the shift in customer purchases through Intuit's direct marketing channel affect the timing of its consumer tax revenue during the tax season. These factors, among others, have increased the uncertainty for the full tax season. - Actual product returns may exceed product return reserves, particularly for Intuit's tax preparation software. - If Intuit fails to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for its electronic tax offerings or customer support function, it could lose revenue and customers. - Integrating acquired businesses creates challenges for Intuit's operational, financial and management information systems. If Intuit is unable to adequately address these and other issues presented by acquisitions, Intuit may not fully realize the intended benefits of its acquisitions. - Expansion of Intuit's product and service offerings requires Intuit to develop and enhance more and increasingly complex products, market and sell higher priced products and
services and distribute and support an expanding portfolio of products and services. It also increases the number and complexity of Intuit's revenue models. If Intuit is unable to support its expanded businesses, they may not achieve sustainable financial viability or broad customer acceptance. - Intuit faces competitive pressures in all of its businesses, which can have a negative impact on its revenue, profitability and market position. - Risks related to Intuit's distribution channels include challenges in negotiating favorable terms with retailers and the negative affect of the current economic environment on retail sales. In addition, expansion of Intuit's product and service offerings requires Intuit to develop and manage a direct sales organization, which is a new distribution method for Intuit. - A continuation of the recent general decline in economic conditions and the softness in retail sales could lead to significantly reduce demand for Intuit's products and services. - Revenue growth for Intuit's vertical business management solutions is subject to risks such as the negative impact of the current economic environment and the potential disruption to the businesses during the acquisition integration process. - Risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing governmental regulation could hinder the growth of Intuit's businesses.

(NASDAQ: INTU) today announced that its board of directors has authorized a three-year stock repurchase program for up to $500 million. "Intuit is continually working to enhance shareholder value," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "We have multiple growth engines that are driving revenue growth of at least 25 percent and pro forma earnings per share of at least 41 percent. We are acquiring new companies to provide platforms for future growth. And at the same time, we're using our strong cash position to continue to repurchase our stock." This is Intuit's second repurchase program. The first, a three-year $500 million program, was authorized by the board in May 2001 and was subsequently increased to $750 million. That program was completed in December 2002.

If Intuit is unable to adequately address these and other issues presented by acquisitions, Intuit may not fully realize the intended benefits of its acquisitions. - Expansion of Intuit's product and service offerings requires Intuit to develop and enhance more and increasingly complex products, market and sell higher priced products and services and distribute and support an expanding portfolio of products and services. It also increases the number and complexity of Intuit's revenue models. If Intuit is unable to support its expanded businesses, they may not achieve sustainable financial viability or broad customer acceptance. - Intuit faces competitive pressures in all of its businesses, which can have a negative impact on its revenue, profitability and market position. - Risks related to Intuit's distribution channels include challenges in negotiating favorable terms with retailers and the negative affect of the current economic environment on retail sales. In addition, expansion of Intuit's product and service offerings requires Intuit to develop and manage a direct sales organization, which is a new distribution method for Intuit. - A continuation of the recent general decline in economic conditions and the softness in retail sales could lead to significantly reduce demand for Intuit's products and services. - Revenue growth for Intuit's vertical business management solutions is subject to risks such as the negative impact of the current economic environment and the potential disruption to the businesses during the acquisition integration process. - Risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing governmental regulation could hinder the growth of Intuit's businesses.

EXHIBIT 99.01
SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
The following table shows selected consolidated financial information for Intuit for the past five fiscal years. The comparability of the information is affected by a variety of factors, including acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments. In fiscal 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we sold our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. To better understand the information in the table, investors should read "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Exhibit 99.02, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Exhibit 99.03.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.02
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
NOTE: For a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, and some of the risks that could affect future results, see "Risks That Could Affect Future Results" below. This section should also be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Exhibit 99.03. As discussed below, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002 and our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, in February 2003 and have accounted for these entities as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations.
Results of Operations
Three-Year Total Net Revenue and Net Income (Loss) Trends
Overview
Intuit's mission is to revolutionize how people manage their financial lives, and how small businesses and accounting professionals manage their businesses. Our goal is to create changes so profound customers wouldn't dream of going back to their old ways of keeping their books, doing their taxes or managing their personal finances. Intuit is a leading provider of small business, tax preparation and personal finance software products and services that simplify complex financial tasks for small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals. Our principal products and services include: small business accounting and business management solutions, including our QuickBooks line of products and services as well as our Intuit line of industry-specific business management solutions; TurboTax consumer tax products and services; ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products and services; and Quicken personal finance products and services.
The business models for many of our products and services provide us with significant profit leverage, for three primary reasons. First, these businesses have relatively high fixed costs and low variable costs, so as we increase units sold, we generate more profit per incremental unit sold. Second, as we offer products and services with greater functionality, we can increase prices to reflect the greater value that we deliver to customers. Third, as customers move to some of our higher-end products and services, the better product and service mix is resulting in more revenue and profit per customer.
Our tax businesses are highly seasonal. Sales of tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. These seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30. We typically report losses in our first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31 when revenue from our tax businesses are minimal, but operating expenses to develop new products and services continue at relatively consistent levels.
Acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets have had a significant impact on the comparability of our results year over year. During the past three years, we have completed several acquisitions and dispositions. In fiscal 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 we sold our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK. We have accounted for these entities as discontinued operations. See Notes 9, 10 and 11 of the financial statements. The impairment of goodwill and other intangibles received in connection with acquisitions has also had a significant impact on our operating results. During fiscal 2001 and 2002, we
 
recorded charges of $78.7 million and $27.3 million for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Total goodwill amortization expense, including impairments, was $139.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $122.6 million in fiscal 2002. We adopted Statement of Financial Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 on August 1, 2002. The adoption of this standard eliminated the amortization of goodwill commencing with the first quarter of fiscal 2003. However, it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to existing goodwill, as well as to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. See Notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements for more information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets and the impact of impairment charges on our reported net income.
Gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments have had a significant impact on the comparability of our yearly results as well. All of our marketable securities and long-term investments are holdings in high technology companies that have been extremely volatile since we purchased them. In fiscal 2001 and 2002, the market prices of a number of these companies' securities declined substantially from our initial investment due to the economic downturn in the high technology industry. During fiscal 2001 and 2002, we recorded charges of $68.8 million and $9.5 million for other-than-temporary declines in the value of our available-for-sale marketable securities and other investments, and a charge of $40.0 million during fiscal 2001 relating to the decline in the valuation of our trading securities. See Note 3 of the financial statements for more information regarding our investments in marketable securities and the impact of our trading securities on our reported net income.
Critical Accounting Policies
In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets on our balance sheet. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 of the financial statements for more information about these critical accounting policies, as well as descriptions of other significant accounting policies.
 
 
Total Net Revenue
The table below shows total net revenue and percentage of total net revenue for each of our business segments for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002. We have reclassified prior year information to conform to the current year financial presentation for comparability. See Note 14 of the financial statements for additional information about our business segments.
NM is a non-meaningful comparison.
 
Total net revenue for fiscal 2002 was $1,312.2 million, compared to $1,096.1 million in fiscal 2001, representing an increase of 20%. The fiscal 2002 increase in net revenue was primarily due to growth of 31% in our Employer Services segment, 29% in our Consumer Tax segment and 20% in our Professional Accounting Solutions segments. Net revenue from our Small Business segment increased 14% due to growth in Quickbooks-related products. Personal Finance net revenue declined 9% in fiscal 2002, reflecting a decrease in Internet advertising revenue and lower sales of Quicken due to the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.
. Total net revenue for fiscal 2001 was $1,096.1 million, compared to $981.7 million in fiscal 2000, representing an increase of 12%. Our Consumer Tax segment had a strong year with an increase of 26% that was driven by Web-based tax return preparation and electronic tax return filing services revenue, which more than doubled from fiscal 2000. The revenue growth also reflected a 57% increase in our Employer Services segment. Growth in these segments was partially offset by a 16% decline in the Personal Finance segment. Personal Finance was adversely affected by the declining demand for Internet advertising as well as by lower sales of Quicken due to an overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Total Net Revenue by Business Segment
The following net revenue discussion is categorized by our business segments, which reflect how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. The net revenue impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software Corporation is discussed below under Professional Accounting Solutions. No other acquisitions have had a material impact on net revenue in the periods presented.
Small Business
Small Business product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks desktop software products and financial supplies. Small Business services revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks Service Solutions, our fee for support plan. Our Small Business Verticals businesses are managed separately from the Small Business segment, so their revenue is included in the Small Business Verticals and Other segment below.
. Small Business total net revenue increased 14% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Total QuickBooks-related revenue (which includes QuickBooks desktop software products, QuickBooks support plans, QuickBooks Internet Gateway and QuickBooks Online Edition) was 11% higher while QuickBooks desktop product revenue alone grew 19%. The increase in QuickBooks desktop product revenue reflected higher average selling prices driven primarily by the November 2001 launch of our higher-priced QuickBooks Premier products, as well as 12% higher unit sales. The volume increase was driven by strong upgrade sales, which we believe were due in part to our decision to discontinue technical support and tax table services during calendar 2002 for customers using certain older versions of QuickBooks. We believe that the availability of a range of third party offerings from the Intuit Developer Network to QuickBooks 2002 customers may also have contributed to the stronger upgrade sales. Fiscal 2002 QuickBooks-related revenue growth also reflected strong results from QuickBooks Service Solutions. In August 2001, we began offering several higher-end support plans, which resulted in significantly higher average selling prices that more than offset declines in volume compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue growth in QuickBooks-related products and services was partially offset by a decline in QuickBooks Internet Gateway revenue. Revenue for this business decreased due to a sharp decline in upfront fees received from Internet Gateway participants, as well as a decrease in transaction-based fees that reflects lower customer demand for Internet Gateway services and fewer services being offered. Financial supplies revenue increased modestly during the year.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
We expect continued growth in our Small Business segment in fiscal 2003. We expect QuickBooks-related revenue to increase due to the fiscal 2002 introduction of products with more advanced functionality such as QuickBooks Premier, QuickBooks Premier: Accountant Edition and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions Business Management Software, which have significantly higher selling prices than our other QuickBooks products.
. For fiscal 2001, total net revenue for the Small Business segment increased 6% over fiscal 2000. Revenue from QuickBooks desktop products remained relatively flat. While average selling
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
 
prices increased for the year, unit sales declined 17%. This was attributable to a decline in the rate at which existing QuickBooks customers upgraded to newer QuickBooks products, as well as to a lower acquisition rate of new users. Product revenue from our financial supplies and services revenue from our QuickBooks Internet Gateway and QuickBooks Service Solutions increased in fiscal 2001.
Employer Services
Employer Services product revenue is derived primarily from our QuickBooks Do-It-Yourself Payroll (formerly Basic Payroll) offering. Employer Services services revenue is derived primarily from our QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service (formerly Deluxe Payroll) and Intuit Payroll Services  Complete Payroll (formerly Premier Payroll).
. Employer Services total net revenue increased 31% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, reflecting 39% combined growth for the QuickBooks-branded Do-It-Yourself Payroll and Assisted Payroll Service offerings, with revenue for the Intuit Payroll Services  Complete Payroll service roughly flat. Price increases accounted for a significant portion of the Do-It-Yourself Payroll and Assisted Payroll Service revenue growth, although the number of customers for the combined offerings also increased by approximately 12%.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
We expect total net revenue to continue to increase in our Employer Services business in fiscal 2003, due in part to the acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc., a provider of full-service outsourced payroll functions for small businesses, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
. Employer Services total net revenue increased 57% for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Increases in our average selling prices for both our Do-It-Yourself Payroll offering and our Assisted Payroll Service contributed to this growth. The higher average selling prices resulted from price increases as well as a shift toward a mix of higher-priced products. The number of customers for the combined offerings also grew approximately 7%.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Consumer Tax
Consumer Tax product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax federal and state consumer desktop tax preparation products. Consumer Tax services revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax for the Web online tax preparation services and electronic filing services.
Consumer Tax total net revenue increased 29% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue from TurboTax desktop products was up 10%, due primarily to higher average selling prices resulting from the introduction of a higher-priced premium product. Revenue from TurboTax for the Web was strong in fiscal 2002, reflecting a significant increase in the mix of higher-end service offerings (TurboTax Premier) as well as 84% unit growth. Electronic filing units and revenue also contributed to the year-over-year growth. Overall, our Consumer Tax customer base grew 19% in fiscal 2002.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.
. For fiscal 2001, Consumer Tax total net revenue increased approximately 26% compared to fiscal 2000. The increase was due to a combination of higher average selling prices resulting from price increases as well as improved product mix and increased unit sales for both our desktop products and Web-based tax preparation services. Our Consumer Tax business also benefited from Microsoft's discontinuation of its desktop consumer tax preparation software after the 1999 tax season which ended April 15, 2000. Our Web-based tax preparation and electronic filing services also experienced strong growth during fiscal 2001. Web-based tax preparation revenue more than doubled from fiscal 2000 as a result of increased prices as well as a 71% increase in unit volume. In addition, our electronic filing services revenue increased 53%. Overall, our Consumer Tax customer base grew 14% in fiscal 2001.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
We expect continued growth in our Consumer Tax business in fiscal 2003 due to the continuing upward trend in consumer use of the Web for tax return preparation and filing. We also expect revenue growth as a result of product activation features to be included in the tax year 2002 federal versions of TurboTax desktop products for Windows, which are designed to reduce unauthorized sharing of those products.
 
Professional Accounting Solutions
Professional Accounting Solutions product revenue is derived primarily from ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax preparation products. Professional Accounting Solutions services revenue is derived primarily from electronic filing and tax advice services.
. Total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 20% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Approximately $21.0 million or 11% of the growth compared to fiscal 2001 resulted from our acquisition of Tax and Accounting Software Corporation in April 2001. Higher revenue from electronic filing services was also a significant factor in the increase. Our fiscal 2002 introduction of product activation technology that restricted sharing of professional tax products and higher average selling prices for our ProSeries and Lacerte unlimited-use products also contributed to the revenue growth. Renewal rates for our existing customer base remained strong during fiscal 2002.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
. Total net revenue from our professional tax preparation products and services increased 10% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. This growth resulted from higher average selling prices for both our ProSeries and Lacerte unlimited-use products and unit growth for our pay-per return customers. Renewal rates for our existing customer base were strong during fiscal 2001.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
We expect continued growth in our Professional Accounting Solutions business in fiscal 2003 but we expect the rate of growth to slow compared to fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 growth rates for this business were unusually high due to the acquisition of TAASC in late fiscal 2001.
Personal Finance
Personal Finance product revenue is derived primarily from Quicken desktop products. Personal Finance services revenue is minimal. Other revenue consists of Quicken.com advertising revenue and royalties for online transactions.
. Personal Finance total net revenue decreased 9% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001, due primarily to a 15% decline in revenue from Quicken desktop products and a 38% decline in Quicken.com revenue. Solid growth in our online transactions business partially offset these declines. The decrease in Quicken revenue reflected the continuing overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category. Our share of retail units in this category remained above 70% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in Quicken.com advertising revenue reflected the industry-wide decline in spending by purchasers of Internet advertising. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2003.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
. Total net revenue from the Personal Finance segment decreased 16% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. This decline in revenue was attributable in part to a 27% decline in unit sales for our Quicken desktop products and a 31% decline in our Quicken.com Internet advertising revenues. Quicken revenue was down due to an overall decline in the personal finance desktop software category. Advertising revenue declined compared to the prior year due to the overall economic environment which resulted in reduced advertising spending by purchasers of Internet advertising. We experienced continued growth in our online transactions business, which partially offset these declines.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Global Business
Global Business product revenue is derived primarily from QuickBooks, Quicken and QuickTax desktop software products in Canada. Global Business services revenue consists primarily of revenue from software maintenance contracts sold with QuickBooks in Canada.
. Global Business total net revenue increased 35% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Revenue from Canada increased 29% year over year. This reflected strong tax season results for QuickTax, due in part to the preliminary success of our efforts to reduce unauthorized sharing of desktop software. Canadian tax revenue growth was partially offset by modest revenue declines for QuickBooks and Quicken.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
 
. Global Business total net revenue for fiscal 2001 increased 18% compared to fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily due to 39% overall revenue growth in Canada, which was driven by 45% growth in QuickBooks revenue. In addition, Canada experienced 14% growth in professional tax revenue as a result of an acquisition we made early in fiscal 2001.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Small Business Verticals and Other
As part of our Right for My Business strategy, in fiscal 2002 we acquired several companies that enable us to provide accounting and business management solutions to customers in selected industries, which we refer to as "verticals." These new businesses, which we report as a single business segment, include the following: Intuit Construction Business Solutions (formerly OMware, Inc.), which provides business management software for the construction industry; Intuit Public Sector Solutions (formerly The Flagship Group), which offers accounting and business management software solutions for nonprofit organizations, universities, and government agencies; Intuit MRI Real Estate Solutions (formerly Management Reports, Inc.), which provides business management software for commercial and residential property managers; and Intuit Eclipse Distribution Management Solutions (formerly Eclipse, Inc.), which offers business management software for the wholesale durable goods industry.
Three of the four acquisitions were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, total net revenue from the Small Business Vertical and Other segment was not significant in fiscal 2002 and consisted primarily of revenue generated by OMware, Inc. There was no significant revenue in this segment from sources other than the acquired vertical businesses during fiscal 2002. Driving the growth of the vertical businesses we have acquired so far, and acquiring additional vertical businesses, are key business initiatives for fiscal 2003. Therefore, we expect that we will continue to report these businesses as a separate business segment in the future.
Cost of Revenue
There are four components of our cost of revenue: (1) cost of products, which includes the direct cost of manufacturing and shipping desktop software products; (2) cost of services, which reflects direct costs associated with providing services, including data center costs relating to delivering Internet-based services; (3) cost of other revenue, which includes costs associated with generating advertising and marketing and online transactions revenue; and (4) amortization of purchased software, which represents the cost of depreciating products we obtained through acquisitions over their useful lives.
Cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased slightly to 16% in fiscal 2002 from 17% in fiscal 2001. We lowered our per-unit materials, manufacturing and shipping costs for our shrink-wrap software products, resulting in significant cost savings. These savings were nearly offset by increased costs associated with improving our product distribution function. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we established a new third-party retail distribution relationship for our shrink-wrap software products. This distribution relationship enables us to ship a larger percentage of our products directly to individual retail stores and allows us to provide inventory to our retail customers on a more timely basis. By providing better service to our retailers, we are reducing product returns and related costs. Because of this and because we plan to continue
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.
 
redesigning the packaging for many of our software products and further streamlining our manufacturing processes, we expect cost of products as a percentage of product revenue to decline in fiscal 2003.
Cost of services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to 39% in fiscal 2002 from 50% in fiscal 2001. This decrease was attributable primarily to our payroll and Web-based tax businesses, which experienced significant revenue growth with relatively fixed cost bases.
Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 40% in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. This increase was primarily due to increased data center costs related to our Personal Finance segment's online transaction business, which experienced revenue growth in fiscal 2002.
Amortization of purchased software decreased slightly in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. This reflected lower amortization expense in the second half of fiscal 2002 that resulted from a lower base of assets to be amortized. This decline was partially offset by impairment charges for certain purchased software assets that were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, which caused the decrease in the base of assets. See Note 5 of the financial statements.
. Cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased to 17% for fiscal 2001 compared to 19% for fiscal 2000. The decline was primarily attributable to lower excess and obsolete inventory expenses for all of our product lines due to improved inventory management. Cost of services as a percentage of services revenue decreased to 50% for fiscal 2001 compared to 62% for fiscal 2000 due primarily to revenue growth in our payroll business with a relatively fixed cost base. This factor was partially offset by increased data center costs related to our Personal Finance segment's online transactions businesses. Cost of other revenue as a percentage of other revenue increased to 35% for fiscal 2001 compared to 34% for fiscal 2000 due to a significant decrease in Internet advertising revenue with a relatively fixed cost base.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Operating Expenses
 
Customer Service and Technical Support
. Customer service and technical support expenses were 13% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. We improved our efficiency in fiscal 2002 by increasing the proportion of customer service and technical support we provide through less expensive methods such as Web sites, online chat, email and other electronic means. We also implemented a number of successful process excellence initiatives that reduced costs while maintaining or increasing service levels. However, these benefits were more than offset by higher direct sales and support costs associated with converting the customers of Tax Accounting and Software Company, a company that we acquired in April 2001, to our ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products, and by increased demand for customer service and technical support due to our growing customer base. We expect customer service and technical support expenses to decrease slightly as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 as TAASC conversion costs gradually decline and as we continue to benefit from lower cost, more scalable electronic customer service and technical support delivery mechanisms.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
Customer service and technical support expenses were flat at 13% of total net revenue in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. This reflected the benefit of providing an increased proportion of customer service and technical support more efficiently and less expensively through Web sites and other electronic means, and from the expansion of QuickBooks Service Solutions, our fee for support program for QuickBooks customers. These improvements were offset by the April 2001 start of support costs to convert customers of our newly acquired TAASC business to our ProSeries and Lacerte professional tax products.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000.
Selling and Marketing
. Selling and marketing expenses were 20% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2002, selling and marketing expenses increased as we expanded our small business marketing programs to support the Right for My Business strategy announced in September 2001. We also incurred incremental marketing expenses for our Construction Business Solutions products, which we acquired in November 2001. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenue for our payroll business due to significant revenue growth in that segment. We also donated $8.0 million to The Intuit Foundation in fiscal 2002, which will be used to benefit the community through contributions to selected non-profit organizations. We expect selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 as we expand marketing programs for our new QuickBooks products as well as for the Right for My Business products and services we recently introduced and those we expect to introduce in fiscal 2003.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
. Selling and marketing expenses were 20% of total net revenue in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2000 we experienced relatively higher sales and marketing expenses in the first half of the year due to aggressive marketing programs to expand our Internet-based businesses and to respond to Microsoft's TaxSaver consumer tax offering. In fiscal 2001 our payroll business also experienced relatively lower marketing expenditures as it continued to benefit from the marketing value of the Intuit brand.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Research and Development
. During fiscal 2002, we increased research and development spending in some of our highest-growth businesses  small business, consumer tax and professional tax  by approximately 10%. In particular, we continued to invest in our Right for My Business strategy, including new QuickBooks Premier, Point of Sale and Enterprise products launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Intuit Developer Network, and other new products that we expect to introduce in fiscal 2003. At the same time, we significantly decreased or stopped spending in less strategic areas and discontinued product lines. We also benefited from improvements in our development process that resulted in shorter development times and higher quality for our new QuickBooks products. The net result was that research and development expenses in fiscal 2002 were flat in absolute dollars and declined as a percentage of total net revenue to 15% of total net revenue, compared to 18% in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2003, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development, particularly for new small business products and services.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
 
. Fiscal 2001 research and development expenses were 18% of total net revenue, compared to 16% of total net revenue in fiscal 2000. In both fiscal 2001 and 2000, we invested significant amounts in our services businesses, mostly focused in our Small Business and Employer Services segments. This included research and development efforts for QuickBooks Online Edition, our QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service (formerly Deluxe Payroll), our QuickBase information management tool and the Intuit Developer Network.

. General and administrative expenses were 8% of total net revenue in fiscal 2002, compared to 9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2001. We experienced increased directors' and officers' liability insurance costs and costs associated with integrating our acquisitions of OMware, Inc. in November 2001 and EmployeeMatters, Inc. in December 2000. These increases were offset by decreases in bad debt charges in fiscal 2002. We had relatively high accounts receivable write-offs in fiscal 2001 due to the deteriorating financial condition of many Internet companies with whom we did business. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of total net revenue in fiscal 2003 due to the costs of integrating our fourth quarter fiscal 2002 acquisitions and other acquisitions we expect to make in fiscal 2003, as well as to investments in our internal audit function and process excellence infrastructure. We also expect bad debt expense for fiscal 2003 to be somewhat higher than for fiscal 2002 because we experienced unusually low levels of bad debt expense in fiscal 2002.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001
. General and administrative expenses were 9% of total net revenue for fiscal 2001, compared to 7% of total net revenue for fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, we experienced an increase in our bad debt expense related to the economic downturn in the high technology industry that impacted many companies with whom we did business. Our general and administrative expense for fiscal 2001 also included an increase of $1.2 million in deferred compensation amortization expense related to restricted stock we granted when we hired our President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2000.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Charge for Purchased Research and Development
In connection with certain acquisitions and with the assistance of third-party appraisers, we determine the value of in-process projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established. The value of the projects is determined by estimating the costs to develop the in-process technology into commercially feasible products, estimating the net cash flows we believe would result from the products and discounting these net cash flows back to their present value. The resulting amount is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development when we acquire certain new businesses.
In fiscal 2002, we recorded a charge of $2.2 million for purchased research and development as a result of our acquisition of Management Reports, Inc. (now Intuit MRI Real Estate Solutions). In fiscal 2001, we recorded a charge of $0.2 million for purchased research and development when we acquired Tax Accounting and Software Corporation. We recorded $1.3 million for purchased research and development as a result of our Boston Light Software Corporation and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation acquisitions in fiscal 2000.
Although we intend to continue to acquire relatively mature businesses with products whose technological feasibility has been demonstrated as part of our Right for My Business Strategy, it is possible that we will incur additional charges for purchased research and development in the future.
Charge for Vacant Facilities
During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings in Mountain View, California and that we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space. As a result, we recorded a charge of $13.2 million. See Note 13 of the financial statements.
 
Acquisition-Related Charges
Acquisition-related charges include the amortization of goodwill, purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation expenses arising from acquisitions, and impairment charges relating to certain acquired assets. See Note 5 of the financial statements.
The FASB recently adopted a new standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination. It continues to require us to recognize goodwill as an asset whenever we pay more for a business than the total of its net tangible and intangible assets, but it does not permit us to amortize goodwill, which we were previously required to do. Under the new statement, we must separately test goodwill for impairment using a fair-value-based approach on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs indicating potential impairment. The shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001. The additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired after June 30, 2001 would have been approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2002 had this new standard not been in place. We will adopt the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and will therefore cease goodwill amortization for acquisitions we made prior to July 1, 2001. However, it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. In addition, we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate. In accordance with the new standard, we transferred the balance of $1.9 million for assembled workforce at August 1, 2002 to goodwill and will no longer amortize that asset. See Note 1 of the financial statements.
In fiscal 2002 acquisition-related charges were $181.4 million, compared to $247.8 million in fiscal 2001. Acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2002 included impairment charges totaling $22.0 million that were related to our Internet-based advertising business and our Site Solutions business. See Notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements. Acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2002 also reflected an increase of $12.7 million in amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of EmployeeMatters, Inc. in December 2000 and Tax Accounting and Software Corporation in April 2001. Acquisition-related charges for fiscal 2001 included impairment charges that totaled $78.7 million.
Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001.
. In fiscal 2001 acquisition-related charges were $247.8 million, compared to $150.2 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to impairment charges totaling $78.7 million that were recorded in the second half of fiscal 2001. During our review for impairment, events and circumstances indicated possible impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions of Venture Finance Software Corp., SecureTax.com and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation. See Notes 1 and 5 of the financial statements. Based on our analysis we recorded impairment charges of $51.0 million, $26.0 million and $1.7 million associated with VFSC, SecureTax and Hutchison, respectively.
Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000
Loss on Impairment of Long-lived Asset
The fiscal 2002 loss on impairment of long-lived asset related to the impairment of the asset we received from the purchaser of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001. We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are impaired. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset. Based on our resulting analysis of the asset's fair value, we recorded a charge of $27.0 million to reduce the carrying value of this asset to its estimated fair value of zero, reflecting the deteriorating financial condition of the purchasing company. See Note 12 of the financial statements.
Non-Operating Income and Expenses
Interest and Other Income
In fiscal 2002, interest and other income decreased to $27.3 million, compared to $57.6 million in fiscal 2001 and $48.7 million in fiscal 2000. The decrease during fiscal 2002 was due to a sharp decline in the interest we earned on our cash and short-term investment balances in fiscal 2002, reflecting significant decreases in market interest rates during the period. The increase during fiscal 2001 resulted from higher average cash and short-term investment balances, due in part to sales of marketable securities as well as more cash generated from operations compared to
 
fiscal 2000. The total fiscal 2001 increase was partially offset by the effect of lower market interest rates compared to fiscal 2000. Interest earned on customer payroll deposits is reported as revenue for our payroll business, and is not included in interest and other income.
Gains (Losses) on Marketable Securities and Other Investments, Net
As of July 31, 2002, we held marketable securities and long-term investments in privately held companies carried at $23.6 million on our balance sheet. This balance was down from $109.4 million as of July 31, 2001 due to sales and write-downs. We review the values of our investments each quarter and make adjustments as appropriate. See Notes 1 and 3 of the financial statements. The steep decline in equity markets over the past few years has significantly reduced the value of our marketable securities and long-term investments. If the value of these remaining securities continues to decline in the future, it would have a negative impact on our financial results.
We considered our shares of Excite@Home and 724 Solutions common stock to be trading securities. As a result, unrealized gains or losses due to market fluctuations in these securities were included in our net income or loss on a quarterly basis until we sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We considered our other marketable securities to be available-for-sale and did not reflect quarterly fluctuations in their value in our net income or loss on a quarterly basis unless we concluded that a decline in value was other-than-temporary. See Note 3 of the financial statements.
We recorded pre-tax net losses relating to marketable securities and other investments of $15.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $98.1 million in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2000, we recorded a pre-tax gain relating to marketable securities and other investments of $481.1 million. See Note 3 of the financial statements. The fiscal 2002 net loss included charges totaling $9.5 million to write down certain long-term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary. Our fiscal 2001 net loss included charges of $40.2 million to write down certain available-for-sale securities for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary and $28.6 million to write down certain long-term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary. The fiscal 2000 net gain resulted primarily from our sales of Checkfree, Signio (now VeriSign) and Homestore.com common stock.
Net Gains (Losses) on Divestitures
In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to terminate our $20.3 million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill Manager business, which we sold in May 2001. When we terminated the interactive services agreement, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.3 million. See Note 10 of the financial statements. In the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we wrote off the $27.0 million asset acquired from the purchaser of our Quicken Bill Manager business to loss on impairment of long-lived asset in our statement of operations. See Note 12 of the financial statements.
During fiscal 2001 we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $15.3 million resulting from our divestitures of businesses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we realized a pre-tax net gain of $1.6 million for the sale of certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, Intuit Insurance Services, Inc., which operated our Quicken Insurance business. The gain was more than offset by a pre-tax net loss of $16.9 million for the sale of the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. See Note 10 of the financial statements. Neither of these divestitures represented discontinued operations.
Income Tax (Benefit) Provision
For fiscal 2002, we recorded an income tax provision of $16.9 million on pre-tax income from continuing operations of $70.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. For fiscal 2001, we recorded an income tax benefit of $12.5 million on a pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $137.1 million, resulting in an effective rate of approximately 9%. For fiscal 2000, we recorded an income tax provision of $216.6 million on pre-tax income of $542.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately 40%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to a tax benefit related to a divestiture that became available during the year and tax-exempt interest income, offset by non-deductible merger related charges. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of non-deductible merger and divestiture related charges offset by the benefit we received from tax-exempt interest income.
 
Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of non-deductible merger charges offset by the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income.
As of July 31, 2002, we had net deferred tax assets of $244.4 million, which included a valuation allowance of $6.8 million for net operating loss carryforwards relating to our international subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards. The allowance reflects management's assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards of our international subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions. While we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. See Note 20 of the financial statements.
Discontinued Operations
Quicken Loans
On July 31, 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment and received consideration in the form of a five-year interest bearing promissory note in the principal amount of $23.3 million. This amount exceeded the net shareholders' equity of Quicken Loans by $23.3 million. We accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with APB No. 30, the operating results of Quicken Loans have been segregated from continuing operations in our statements of operations for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and are shown on a single line captioned net income (loss) from Quicken Loans discontinued operations. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. We did not record the tax benefit related to the gain on the transaction because we cannot be assured that we will realize the tax benefit. See Note 11 of the financial statements.
Concurrent with the sale, we signed an agreement to license the Quicken Loans brand and a distribution agreement under which the purchasing company will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We will receive minimum royalties of $1.8 million a year for the next five years under the licensing agreement and minimum fees of $0.8 million a year for the next five years under the distribution agreement. Royalties and fees under these agreements will be recorded as earned and included in other income on our statement of operations.
Intuit KK
On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to a private equity investment firm located in Japan. We accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In accordance with SFAS 144, the operating results of Intuit KK have been segregated from continuing operations in our statements of operations for fiscal years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and are shown on a single line captioned net income (loss) from Intuit KK discontinued operations. See Note 11 of the financial statements.
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change
During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative gain of $14.3 million, net of taxes, as a result of a change in accounting principle when we adopted SFAS 133, We recognized the cumulative effect of the change in how we accounted for options to purchase shares of S1 Corporation as of August 1, 2000. See Note 1 of the financial statements. Subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options were included in our net income or net loss until we sold them in the first quarter of fiscal 2002.
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At July 31, 2002 our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1,230.1 million, a $43.9 million increase from July 31, 2001.
We generated $344.3 million in cash from our operations during fiscal 2002. The primary components of cash provided by operations were net income from continuing operations of $53.6 million and adjustments made for non-cash expenses, including acquisition-related charges and amortization of purchased software of $193.8 million, depreciation charges of $58.8 million and an impairment loss on a long-lived asset of $27.0 million.
We used $25.1 million in cash for investing activities during fiscal 2002. Our primary use of cash was for business acquisitions, which totaled $278.3 million net of cash we acquired. Our short-term investments decreased $304.0 million during the fiscal year, with proceeds of $3.15 billion from the sale upon maturity of certain short-term investments partially offset by reinvestments of $2.85 billion. As a result of our continued investment in information systems and infrastructure, we also purchased property and equipment of $42.1 million and capitalized internal use software development projects of $21.3 million in fiscal 2002.
We used $196.1 million in cash for our financing activities in fiscal 2002. The primary component of cash used was $318.4 million for the repurchase of treasury stock through our stock repurchase program. See Note 17 of the financial statements. This was partially offset by proceeds of $133.6 million we received from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.
In the normal course of business, we enter into leases for new or expanded facilities in both domestic and global locations. We also evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. We may decide to use cash and cash equivalents to fund such activities in the future.
In May 2001, Intuit's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock over a three-year period. In July 2002, our Board of Directors increased the authorized purchase amount by $250 million. At July 31, 2002, we had repurchased a total of $326.8 million of common stock since the inception of the program.
In connection with the sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002, we agreed to continue providing to the purchasing company an interest-bearing line of credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months. The line expires on January 31, 2003. The line is secured by the related mortgage loans and had an outstanding balance of $245.6 million at July 31, 2002. See Note 11 of the financial statements.
Loans to executive officers and other employees totaled $12.9 million at July 31, 2001 and $21.3 million at July 31, 2002. Loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans and none of these were made or modified since July 31, 2002. Loans are generally interest-bearing, secured by real property and have maturity dates of up to 10 years. See Note 22 of the financial statements.
We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.
 
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 31, 2002:
Restricted cash at July 31, 2002 included $5.8 million that we held in escrow in connection with our fiscal 2002 acquisition of CBS Employer Services, Inc. The escrow period expires in June 2003. Restricted cash also included $5.5 million for rebates due our customers.
Other obligations at July 31, 2002 consisted primarily of amounts we owe to former stockholders of CBS Employer Services, Inc. in connection with Intuit's acquisition of that company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. This contractual obligation is included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet. See Notes 9 and 15 of the financial statements.
Recent Pronouncements
On June 29, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 141, "" and SFAS 142, "."
Business Combinations,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS 141 supercedes APB Opinion No. 16, "" and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations, thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, in applying the purchase method, SFAS 141 changes the criteria for recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states that the following criteria should be considered in determining the classification of intangible assets: (1) whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or (2) whether the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. If neither criteria is met, the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are not amortized. We have applied the requirements of SFAS 141 to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
Business Combinations,
SFAS 142 supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, "" and provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized. However, these assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. The shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001. The additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired subsequent to June 30, 2001 would have been approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2002 had this new standard not been in place. Total goodwill amortization expense, including impairments, was $139.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $122.6 million in fiscal 2002. We adopted the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions made prior to July 1, 2001. However, it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. In addition, we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate.
Intangible Assets,
In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation under SFAS 142, we will perform an assessment of goodwill impairment as of August 1, 2002, the date of adoption. To accomplish this, we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of adoption. We will then have up to
 
six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit's carrying amount. To the extent that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, both of which will be measured as of the date of adoption. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS 141. This second step is required to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations.
As of the date of adoption of SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002, we had an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately $123.6 million, excluding the balance of approximately $1.9 million for assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill. As of that date, we also had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $430.8 million which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill. These balances will be subject to the transitional provisions of SFAS 141 and 142. Transitional impairment losses that may be required to be recognized upon adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 are indeterminable at this time.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, which applies to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement 121, and portions of APB Opinion No. 30, SFAS 144 provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets we expect to dispose of and significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held-for-sale. This classification is important because held-for-sale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount. SFAS 144 also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period(s) in which the losses are actually incurred, rather than when the amount of the loss is estimated, as presently required. We adopted SFAS 144 effective August 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,"
"Reporting the Results of Operations."
In November 2001, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force released Issue No. 01-9, "," which applies to annual or interim financial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2001. The release provides that cash consideration (including sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and reasonably estimate. We adopted this new release beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 01-9 did not have a material impact on our total net revenue and as a result we did not reclassify prior period financial statements.
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's Product
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, This statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under EITF Issue No. 94-3, A formal commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one-time charge for most exit and disposal costs. Instead, companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value, and will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of SFAS 146 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under EITF Issue No. 94-3 are not affected. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 146 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Company-Wide Factors That Could Affect Future Results
Several of our businesses are highly seasonal  particularly our tax businesses, but also small business and personal finance to a lesser extent. This causes significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Revenue and operating results are usually strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters ending January 31 and April 30. We experience lower revenues, and often significant operating losses, in the first and fourth quarters ending October 31 and July 31. Our financial results can also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including changes in product release dates, and the timing of acquisitions, dispositions, goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges and gains and losses related to marketable securities.
Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal. Seasonality and other factors cause significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and net income.
Recent declines in interest rates have resulted in a significant decline in the interest income we earned on our investment portfolio during recent reporting periods, which has had a negative impact on our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share. Declining interest rates can also reduce the value of our interest rate sensitive assets, such as certain assets that relate to our payroll business. See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for more details.
Fluctuations in interest rates can cause significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our net income, earnings per share and asset values.
During the past few years, we have completed numerous acquisitions, including five during fiscal 2002. These acquisitions have expanded our product and service offerings, personnel and geographic locations. Integrating and organizing acquired businesses creates challenges for our operational, financial and management information systems, as well as for our product development processes. We might not be able to coordinate the diverse operating structures, policies and practices of companies we have acquired or successfully integrate the employees of the acquired companies into our organization and culture, which could harm employee morale and productivity. These difficulties may be increased by the various geographic locations of our acquired businesses, which include Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio and Texas. If we do not adequately address issues presented by growth through acquisitions, we may not fully realize the intended benefits (including financial benefits) of these acquisitions.
Our recent acquisitions have presented business integration challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of these acquisitions.
A key component of our Right for My Business strategy is to continue to expand our product and service offerings, and we expect that a significant portion of this expansion will result from acquisitions. Integrating newly acquired organizations and technologies into our business could put a strain on our resources and be expensive and time consuming. In addition, we may not succeed in integrating acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated financial benefits. Our acquisition strategy and future acquisitions could also result in the following risks:
We expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could put a strain on our resources and adversely affect our financial results.
 
Our recent acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased software (which is reflected in cost of revenue), as well as charges for in-process research and development, and amortization and impairment of goodwill, purchased intangibles and deferred compensation (which are reflected in operating expenses). Total acquisition-related costs in the categories identified above were $158.5 million in fiscal 2000, $263.0 million in fiscal 2001 (including charges of $78.7 million to write down the long-lived intangible assets related to three acquisitions), and $196.0 million in fiscal 2002 (including charges of $27.3 million to write down the long-lived intangible assets related to two acquisitions). Additional acquisitions, and any additional impairment of the value of purchased assets, could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results.
Acquisition-related costs can cause significant fluctuation in our net income.
The new FASB standard for accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination applies to all acquisitions initiated after June 30, 2001. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the new standard for acquisitions we completed before June 30, 2001. Under the new standard, we must continue to recognize goodwill as an asset but will not amortize goodwill as previously required. Instead, we must separately test goodwill for impairment using a fair-value-based approach at least annually and also when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. As a result of this shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach, we will stop recording charges for goodwill amortization. However, it is possible that in the future, we may incur less frequent, but larger, impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions as we continue to expand our business. As of August 1, 2002, we had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $430.8 million, which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill. These amounts could be subject to impairment charges in the future.
Recent changes to Financial Accounting Standards Board guidelines relating to accounting for goodwill could make our acquisition-related charges less predictable in any given reporting period.
There has been increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options. Although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value, it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock options as a compensation expense. Note 17 of the financial statements shows the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net income and earnings per share if it had been in effect during the past three fiscal years and if the compensation expense were calculated as described in Note 17.
If we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense, it would significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share.
The continuing downturn in general economic conditions has led to reduced demand for a variety of goods and services, including software and other technology products. We believe the economic decline was partially responsible for slower than expected growth in our Small Business segment during fiscal 2001 and the first half of fiscal 2002. Although we experienced solid revenue growth in most of our businesses during the second half of fiscal 2002, the future economic environment remains uncertain. If conditions decline, or fail to improve, in geographic areas that are significant to us, such as the United States and Canada, we could see a significant decrease in the overall demand for our products and services that could harm our operating results.
A general decline in economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our products and services.
We believe that it is necessary to continually develop new products and services and to improve existing products and services to remain competitive in the markets we serve. Failure to do so may give competitors opportunities to improve their competitive position at our expense and result in declines in our revenue and earnings. However, developing and improving our products and services is a complex process involving several risks. Hiring and retaining highly qualified technical employees is critical to the success of our development efforts, and we face intense competition for these employees. Launches of products and services can be delayed for a variety of reasons.
If we do not continue to successfully develop new products and services in a timely manner, our future financial results will suffer.
 
New or improved products and services may also have defects that hinder performance. Third-party products we incorporate in, or use to build and support, our products and services may also contain defects that impair performance. These problems can be expensive to fix and can also result in higher technical support costs and lost customers. New products or features are sometimes built on top of older architectures or infrastructures, which can take longer to bring to market, make quality assurance and support more difficult, and lead to complexity in supporting future functionality.
The business models for our expanding range of products and services rely on more complex and varied revenue streams than our traditional desktop software businesses. In particular, the revenue recognition practices of several of the businesses we have recently acquired are more complex than the revenue recognition principles that apply to our existing products and services. We expect this trend to continue with future acquisitions. As a result of both acquisitions and internal growth, we expect to continue expanding our product offerings to larger enterprises, and we may begin to offer additional features and options as part of multiple-element sales arrangements. These dynamics may require us to defer a higher percentage of our product revenue at the time of sale than we do for current products, which would decrease revenue at the time products are shipped, but result in more revenue in fiscal periods after shipment. In addition, many of our newer businesses depend on a different operational infrastructure than our desktop software businesses, and we must continually develop, expand and modify our internal systems and procedures  including call center, customer management, order management, billing and other systems  to support these businesses. In particular, the success of our Internet-based services requires us to maintain continuous and reliable operations at our data center. Despite our efforts, like all providers of Internet-based products and services, we occasionally experience unplanned outages or technical difficulties. Lengthy and/or frequent service outages  particularly for services that customers consider time-sensitive  can result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation and lost customers.
The expansion of our product and service offerings through internal growth and through recent and anticipated acquisitions creates risks due to the number and complexity of our revenue models and the operational infrastructure required to support our expanded portfolio of products and services.
We occasionally experience customer service and support problems, including longer than expected "hold" times when our staffing is inadequate to handle higher than anticipated call volume, and a large number of inquiries from customers checking on the status of product orders when the timing of shipments fails to meet customer expectations. This can adversely affect customer relationships and our financial performance. In order to improve our customer service and technical support, we must continue to focus on eliminating underlying causes of service and support calls through product improvements and better order fulfillment processes, and on more accurately anticipating demand for customer service and technical support.
Despite our efforts to adequately staff and equip our customer service and technical support operations, we cannot always respond promptly to customer requests for assistance.
Despite our efforts to address customer concerns about privacy and security, these issues still pose a significant risk, and we have experienced lawsuits and negative publicity relating to privacy issues. For example, during fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001, there were press articles criticizing our privacy and security practices as they relate to the connectivity of our desktop software to our Web sites. We have faced lawsuits and negative press alleging that we improperly shared information about customers with third-party "ad servers" for our Web sites. A major breach of customer privacy or security by Intuit, or even by another company, could have serious consequences for our businesses, including reduced customer interest and/or additional regulation by federal or state agencies. In addition, the federal government has developed mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols, and we have incurred significant expenses to comply with these requirements. Additional similar federal and state laws, and/or laws that govern telemarketing activity, may be passed in the future, and the cost of complying with additional legislation could have a negative impact on our operating results. If Internet use does not grow as a result of privacy or security concerns, increasing regulation or for other reasons, the growth of our Internet-based businesses would be hindered.
We face risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing regulation, which could hinder the growth of our businesses.
We face ongoing challenges in negotiating favorable terms (including financial terms) with retailers, due in part to the recent trend of declining importance of software as a retail category. In addition, any termination or significant disruption of our relationship with any of our major resellers could result in a decline in our net revenue. Also, any financial difficulties of our resellers could
We face several risks relating to our retail distribution channel.
 
have an adverse effect on our operating expenses if uncollectible amounts from them exceed the bad debt reserves we have established.
To manufacture and distribute our primary retail products at the time of product launches and to replenish products in the retail channel after the primary launch, we have manufacturing relationships with Modus Media and Sony, and a distribution arrangement with Ingram Micro Logistics. While we believe that relying on only three outsourcers for product launches and replenishment improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities, relying on any vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have severe negative consequences if the vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including but not limited to financial difficulties of the vendor.
We rely on third-party vendors to handle substantially all outsourced aspects of manufacturing and distribution for our primary retail desktop software products.
We ship more desktop software products to our distributors and retailers than we expect them to sell, in order to reduce the risk that distributors or retailers will run out of products. This is particularly true for our consumer tax products, which have a short selling season. Like most software companies, we have a liberal product return policy and we have historically accepted significant product returns. We establish reserves for product returns in our financial statements, based on estimated future returns of products. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies  Net Revenue  Return and Rebate Reserves." We closely monitor levels of product sales and inventory in the retail channel in an effort to maintain reserves that are adequate to cover expected returns. In the past, returns have not generally exceeded these reserves. However, if we do experience actual returns that significantly exceed reserves, it would result in lower net revenue.
Actual product returns may exceed returns reserves, particularly for our consumer tax preparation software.
We offer some regulated products and services through separate subsidiary corporations. Establishing and maintaining regulated subsidiaries can requires significant financial, legal and management resources. If any regulated subsidiary fails to comply with applicable regulations, it could face liability to customers and/or penalties and sanctions by government regulators. In addition, our Internet-based products and services are available in many states and foreign countries. As a result, we may be subject to regulation and/or taxation in many additional jurisdictions, which could substantially slow commercial use of the Internet and growth of our Internet-based businesses.
We face existing and potential government regulation in many of our businesses, which can increase our costs and hinder the growth of our businesses.
Our investment activities have had a significant impact on our net income. We recorded pre-tax net gains from marketable securities and other investments of $481.1 million in fiscal 2000 and pre-tax net losses of $98.1 million in fiscal 2001 and $15.5 million in fiscal 2002. As of July 31, 2002, our marketable securities balance was $16.8 million. Any additional significant long-term declines in value of these securities could reduce our net income in future periods.
Gains and losses related to marketable securities and other investments can cause significant fluctuations in our net income.
We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and employee and third-party nondisclosure and license agreements to protect our software products and other proprietary technology. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software "pirates," and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, expensive and time-consuming. Although we have begun to incorporate product activation technology in some of our tax preparation products in order to reduce unauthorized sharing of the products, we expect that software piracy will continue to be a persistent problem for our desktop software products. In addition, the Internet may tend to increase, and provide new methods for, illegal copying of the technology used in our desktop and Internet-based products and services. We also face risks relating to our licensing of our intellectual property to third parties. In connection with our sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business, we licensed the use of the Quicken Loans and Quicken Mortgage trademarks to the purchaser. If the purchaser violates the terms of the trademark license, it could result in serious and irreparable harm to Intuit's reputation and the value of its Quicken-related brands.
Legal protection for our intellectual property is not always effective to prevent unauthorized use or copying.
We have the licenses from third parties that we believe are necessary for using technology that we do not own in our current products and
We do not own all of the software and other technologies used in our products and services.
 
services. From time to time we may be required to renegotiate with these third parties to include their technology in our existing products, in new versions of our current products or in new products. We may not be able to renegotiate licenses on reasonable terms, or at all.
As the number of our products and services increases and their features and content continue to expand, we may increasingly become subject to infringement claims by third parties. Although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products and services do not violate the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement. From time to time, we have received communications from third parties in which the claimant alleges that a product or service we offer infringes the claimant's intellectual property rights. Occasionally these communications result in lawsuits. In many of these cases, it is difficult to assess the extent to which the intellectual property that is being asserted is valid or the extent to which we have any material exposure. Past claims have not resulted in any significant litigation, settlement or licensing expenses, but future claims could present an exposure of uncertain magnitude. Existing or future infringement claims or lawsuits against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming and expensive to defend. Intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following: cease selling, incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all; or redesign our software products or services, possibly in a manner that reduces their commercial appeal. Any of these actions may cause material harm to our business and financial results.
We may unintentionally infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our business operations.
Our business operations depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large number of computer and communications hardware and software systems. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from electrical power interruptions, telecommunication failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorist activities and their aftermath, and other similar events. Other unpredictable events could also impact our ability to continue our business operations. For our Internet-based services, system failures of our internal server operations or those of various third-party service providers could result in interruption in our services to our customers. Any significant interruptions in our ability to conduct our business operations could reduce our revenue and operating income. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for the impact of interruptions to our business operations.
Our ability to conduct business could be impacted by a variety of factors, such as electrical power interruptions, earthquakes, fires, terrorist activities and other similar events.
Factors Relating to Competition
There are formidable current and potential competitors, including competition from publicly-funded state government entities in the consumer tax area. Accordingly, we expect competition to remain intense during fiscal 2003 and beyond. In all our businesses, we face continual risks that competitors will introduce better products and services, reduce prices, gain better access to distribution channels, increase advertising (including advertising targeted at Intuit customers), and release new products and services before we do. Any of these competitive actions (particularly any prolonged price competition) could result in lower net revenue and/or lower profitability for Intuit. They could also affect our ability to keep existing customers and acquire new customers.
We face competitive pressures in all of our businesses, which can have a negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market position.
Our small business products and services face current competition from competitors' desktop software, as well as from other Web-based small business services products. Microsoft offers several products and services targeted at similar size customers as our high-end QuickBooks products, and has recently acquired additional products and services that compete with our small business offerings. Other competitors and potential competitors have begun providing, or have expressed significant interest in providing, accounting and business management products and services to small businesses. As we implement our Right for My Business strategy we face increased competitive threats from larger companies in bigger markets than we have historically faced. For example, we face direct competition in our Intuit Payroll Services  Complete Payroll business from traditional payroll services offered by a number of companies, including Paychex and ADP. Our financial supplies business faces ongoing pricing pressures from many of our competitors.
In the small business and employer services areas, we face a wide range of competitive risks that could impact our financial results.
 
There are formidable current and potential competitors in the private sector. We also face competition from publicly-funded state government entities that offer individual taxpayers electronic tax preparation and filing services, at no cost to individual taxpayers. If state governmental agencies were to be successful in their efforts to develop consumer tax preparation and filing services and to gain consumer acceptance of those services, it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results in future years. The federal government announced a proposal in August 2002 that would mitigate the risk of government encroachment in federal tax preparation and filing services. The policy proposes that, for at least the next three years, a number of private sector companies, rather than the federal government, would provide Web-based federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to lower income taxpayers and other underserved taxpayers through voluntary public service initiatives such as our Intuit Tax Freedom Project. Despite this positive development, future administrative, regulatory or legislative activity in this area could adversely impact Intuit and other companies that provide tax preparation software and services. Intuit is actively working with others in the private sector, as well as with state government policy makers, to help clarify the appropriate roles for government agencies and the private sector in the electronic commerce marketplace.
We face intense competitive pressures in our consumer tax preparation software business, which can have a negative impact on our revenue, profitability and market position.
Our Quicken products compete directly with Microsoft Money, which is aggressively promoted and priced. We expect competitive pressures for Quicken to continue, both from Microsoft Money and from Web-based personal finance tracking and management tools that are becoming increasingly available at no cost to consumers. Competitive pressures can result in reduced revenue and lower profitability for our Quicken product line. There are many competitors for our Internet-based personal finance products and services. However, the general downturn in Internet and technology stocks since March 2000 has resulted in significant consolidation, with fewer, but more financially sound, competitors surviving. This could make it more difficult for us to compete effectively.
Our personal finance products face aggressive competition that could have a negative impact on revenue, profitability and market position .
Specific Factors Affecting Small Business
A key component of our Right for My Business strategy is to continue to expand our small business accounting and management products and services, through internal growth and from acquisitions. We don't expect that sales of our QuickBooks desktop products alone will be adequate to meet our growth goals. We must generate revenue from a wider range of market and customer segments as well as from new products and services. There are a number of risks associated with the strategy, including the following:
It is too early to provide any assurance that our Right for My Business strategy will generate substantial and sustained revenue growth in the small business accounting and business management segments.

San Francisco, California August 14, 2002, except for Note 11, as to which the date is February 7, 2003
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Intuit and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have reclassified certain other previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation. As discussed in Note 11, the Quicken Loans mortgage business, which we sold on July 31, 2002, has been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 30. Also as discussed in Note 11, Intuit KK, our Japanese subsidiary, became a long-lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144. The sale of Intuit KK closed on February 7, 2003. Accordingly, we have reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect Quicken Loans and Intuit KK as discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations.
Investments in which we intend to maintain more than a temporary 20% to 50% interest, or otherwise have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. Investments in which we have less than a 20% interest and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are carried at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. We monitor both equity and cost basis investments for other than temporary declines in value and make reductions in carrying values when appropriate.
Use of Estimates
We make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. Estimates are used for reserves for product returns, reserves for rebates, determining the collectibility of accounts receivable, the valuation of deferred tax assets and other amounts. We also use estimates to determine the remaining economic lives and carrying values of goodwill, purchased intangibles, property and equipment and other long-lived assets. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates.
Net Revenue
For our shrink-wrapped software products, we generally recognize revenue when we ship products (which is when title passes) either to retailers and distributors or directly to end user customers. We sell certain consumer tax products on consignment. We recognize revenue for consigned software products when the end-user sale has been confirmed. We recognize revenue only if payment is probable and we have no significant remaining obligations to the customer. We recognize revenue from distributors and retailers net of returns reserves that are based on historical returns experience and other factors such as the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel, trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products. We recognize revenue from end users net of rebate reserves that are based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional program, actual sales during the promotion, the amount of redemptions received, historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program and the economic value of the rebate. In some situations, we receive advance payments from our customers. Revenue associated with these advance payments is deferred until the products are shipped or services are provided. We also reduce revenue by the estimated cost of rebates when products are shipped.
We recognize revenue from payroll processing and payroll tax filing services as the services are performed, provided we have no other remaining obligations. We generally require customers to remit payroll and payroll tax liability funds to us in advance of the applicable payroll due date, via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned on invested balances resulting from timing differences between the collection of these funds from customers and the remittance of such funds to outside parties because this interest income represents an integral part of the revenue generated from our services. We recognize this interest as it is earned.
We also offer several plans under which customers pay for technical support assistance. We recognize support revenue over the life of the plan, which is generally one year. We include costs incurred for fee-for-support plans in cost of revenue.
We recognize revenue from other products and services when it is earned based on the nature of the particular product or service. For products and services that we provide over a period of time, we recognize revenue pro rata
 
based on the contractual time period. Where we provide or deliver the product or service at a specific point in time and there are no remaining obligations, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the product or completion of the service.
Shipping and Handling Costs
We record costs incurred for the shipping and handling of our software products as cost of products in our statement of operations.
Customer Service and Technical Support
Customer service and technical support costs include the costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites and other electronic means and providing free technical support assistance to customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. We do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products, since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. We accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.
Software Development Costs
SFAS No. 86, "," requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. SFAS 2, "" establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and development. In accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the statement of operations.
Accounting for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise Marketed
Accounting for Research and Development Costs
We capitalize costs related to the development of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 98-1, "." Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives, generally not to exceed three years.
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
Advertising
We expense advertising costs as we incur them. Advertising expense for the years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 was approximately $42.3 million, $31.6 million and $28.9 million, respectively.
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds in all periods presented. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale debt securities that we carry at fair value. We include unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments, net of tax, in stockholders' equity. Available-for-sale debt securities are classified as current assets based upon our intent and ability to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal and cyclical nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the short-term investments held as available-for-sale securities. See Note 2.
Marketable Securities and Other Long-term Investments
We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale, carry them at fair value and include unrealized gains and losses on them, net of tax, in stockholders' equity. We use the specific identification method to account for gains and losses on marketable equity securities. We include realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities in gains (losses) on marketable securities and other investments, net in the statement of operations. Our other long-term investments consist primarily of equity investments in privately held companies and are stated at cost, adjusted for declines in fair value that are considered other-than-temporary. See Note 3.
 
Change in Accounting Principle
During fiscal 2001, we adopted SFAS 133, "," which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It requires us to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. In May 1999, we completed a $50 million investment (970,813 shares) in Security First Technologies, now known as S1 Corporation. In connection with this agreement, we received options to purchase 4.8 million additional shares of S1 common stock, at a per share purchase price of $51.50. These options contained a net-exercise feature. In August 2000, we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for derivatives for our 4.8 million S1 options held in long-term investments. This resulted in a one-time cumulative effect of $14.3 million, net of income taxes totaling $9.5 million, in the first quarter of fiscal 2001. The one-time cumulative effect created an increase of $0.07 per share in the basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal 2001. SFAS 133 requires the derivatives to be carried at fair value, so subsequent fluctuations in the fair value of these options were included in our net income (loss) until we sold them. For fiscal 2001, these fluctuations resulted in a loss of $9.7 million net of income taxes, which increased the basic and diluted net loss per share for the period by $0.05 per share. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we sold these options and recorded a realized loss of $1.9 million.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
If we had adopted SFAS 133 as of the beginning of fiscal 2000, adjusted pro forma net income would have been $299.1 million compared to reported net income of $305.7 million and adjusted pro forma diluted net income per share would have been $1.42 compared to reported net income per share of $1.45.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms.
Goodwill, Purchased Intangible Assets and Other Long-lived Assets
We record goodwill when the purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets we acquire exceeds their fair value. We generally amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 5 years in all periods presented. However, in accordance with SFAS 142, "," we did not amortize goodwill for acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001 and effective August 1, 2002 we no longer amortize goodwill for acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001. See "below for more information. We amortize the cost of identified intangibles on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 1 to 15 years.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Recent Pronouncements"
We regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are impaired. We look for facts or circumstances, either internal or external, that indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset.
We measure impairment loss related to long-lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of such assets exceed their fair values. Our measurement of fair value is generally based on an analysis of the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows. Our analysis is based on available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considers the likelihood of possible outcomes and is based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows. If necessary, we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 142, "." In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, We implemented both SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. See below for more information.

Customer Deposits
Customer deposits represent cash held on behalf of our customers in our payroll business.
 
Payroll Service Obligations
Payroll service obligations relate to our payroll business and consist primarily of payroll taxes we owe on behalf of our customers.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers
We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, changes in customer requirements, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.
We are also subject to risks related to changes in the values of our significant balances of short-term investments, marketable securities and long-term private equity investments, as well as risks related to the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable. Our portfolio of short-term investments consists primarily of investment-grade securities that are diversified by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer in a managed portfolio to a maximum of $5 million. At July 31, 2002, we held approximately $16.8 million in marketable securities, as described in Note 3. See that note for a discussion of our marketable securities. At July 31, 2002, we also held approximately $6.8 million in long-term private equity investments, net of reserves for declines in value that management has determined to be other-than-temporary.
We sell a significant portion of our products through third-party distributors and retailers. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot necessarily predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate.
One distributor accounted for 10% of total net revenue in fiscal 2000 and the same distributor accounted for 15% of accounts receivable at July 31, 2001. Due to changes in our distributor relationships during fiscal 2002, we are selling an increasing proportion of our software products directly to a variety of retailers rather than through a few major distributors. No distributor or retailer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue in fiscal 2001 or 2002, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of accounts receivable at July 31, 2002.
In connection with the sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002, we have agreed to continue providing to the purchasing company a line of credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months. The line is secured by the related mortgage loans and had an outstanding balance of $245.6 million at July 31, 2002. As part of the consideration for the sale of the business, we also hold a five-year promissory note in the principal amount of $23.3 million from the purchasing company. See Note 11.
We rely on three third party vendors to handle all outsourced aspects of our primary retail desktop software product launches. We also have an exclusive contract with another vendor to print and fulfill orders for all of our checks and many other products for our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on two vendors for product launches and replenishments and on one vendor for our supplies improves the efficiency and reliability of these activities, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue, costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the year. We report translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders' equity. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in the statement of operations and they were immaterial in all periods presented.

SFAS 141 supercedes APB Opinion No. 16, "" and eliminates the pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations, thus requiring that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method. In addition, in applying the purchase method, SFAS 141 changes the criteria for
Business Combinations,
 
recognizing intangible assets other than goodwill and states that the following criteria should be considered in determining the classification of intangible assets: (1) whether the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or (2) whether the intangible asset is separable or dividable from the acquired entity and capable of being sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. If neither criteria is met, the intangible assets are classified as goodwill and are not amortized. We have applied the requirements of SFAS 141 to all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
SFAS 142 supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, "" and provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized. However, these assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. The shift from an amortization approach to an impairment approach applies to all acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001. The additional goodwill amortization charge for businesses we acquired subsequent to June 30, 2001 would have been approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2002 had this new standard not been in place. Total goodwill amortization expense, including impairments, was $139.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $122.6 million in fiscal 2002. We adopted the remaining elements of this new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 and therefore ceased goodwill amortization for acquisitions made prior to July 1, 2001. However, it is possible that in the future we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. In addition, we will continue to amortize most purchased intangible assets and to assess those assets for impairment as appropriate.
Intangible Assets,
In connection with the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation under SFAS 142, we will perform an assessment of goodwill impairment as of August 1, 2002, the date of adoption. To accomplish this, we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each of them by assigning the assets and liabilities, including existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of the date of adoption. We will then have up to six months from the date of adoption to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the reporting unit's carrying amount. To the extent that a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit's goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test. In the second step, we must compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount, both of which will be measured as of the date of adoption. The implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets (recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with SFAS 141. This second step is required to be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the year of adoption. Any transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations.
As of the date of adoption of SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002, we had an unamortized acquired intangible assets balance of approximately $123.6 million, excluding the balance of approximately $1.9 million for assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill. As of that date, we also had an unamortized goodwill balance of approximately $430.8 million which included the amount of assembled workforce reclassified to goodwill. These balances will be subject to the transitional provisions of SFAS 141 and 142. Transitional impairment losses that may be required to be recognized upon adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 are indeterminable at this time.
The following table shows our financial results as they would have been if we had adopted the non-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 as of the beginning of fiscal 2000:
 
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, which applies to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. SFAS 144 supersedes FASB Statement 121, and portions of APB Opinion No. 30, SFAS 144 provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets we expect to dispose of and significantly changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held-for-sale. This classification is important because held-for-sale assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value or carrying amount. SFAS 144 also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period(s) in which the losses are actually incurred, rather than when the amount of the loss is estimated, as presently required. We adopted SFAS 144 effective August 1, 2002 and do not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,"
"Reporting the Results of Operations."
In November 2001, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force released Issue No. 01-9, "," which applies to annual or interim financial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2001. The release provides that cash consideration (including sales incentives) that we give to our customers or resellers should be accounted for as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that we can identify and reasonably estimate.
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor's Product
 
We adopted this new release beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 01-9 did not have a material impact on our total net revenue and as a result we did not reclassify prior period financial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146, This statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under EITF Issue No. 94-3, A formal commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long-lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one-time charge for most exit and disposal costs. Instead, companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value, and will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. Companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of SFAS 146 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under EITF Issue No. 94-3 are not affected. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 146 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit and Disposal Activities."
"Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity."
2. Short-Term Investments
The following schedule summarizes the estimated fair value of our short-term investments as of the dates indicated:
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities held in short-term investments classified by the stated maturity date of the security:
 
3. Marketable Securities and Other Long-term Investments
We currently hold marketable securities that we acquired in connection with strategic business transactions and relationships. In accordance with SFAS 115, we classify marketable securities that we buy and hold principally for the purpose of selling in the near term as trading securities. We report trading securities at estimated fair value and include unrealized gains and losses on these securities in our net income (loss). We classify our other marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. We report available-for-sale securities at estimated fair value and include unrealized gains and losses on these securities in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Marketable securities classified as trading and available-for-sale at July 31, 2002 and 2001 are summarized below. Estimated fair value is based on quoted market prices.
In fiscal 2002, proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $25.0 million; gross realized gains totaled $6.0 million and gross realized losses totaled $2.9 million. In fiscal 2001, proceeds from the sales of available-for-sale securities totaled $21.5 million; gross realized gains totaled $15.8 million and gross realized losses totaled $4.9 million. We recorded charges of $40.2 million in fiscal 2001 to write down certain available-for-sale securities for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary.
Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in our net income (loss). We held no trading securities at July 31, 2002.
Our marketable securities, which are quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, are stocks of high technology companies whose market prices have been extremely volatile and have declined substantially during the past three years. These declines have resulted, and could continue to result, in material reductions in the carrying values of these assets. This has a negative impact on our operating results. If these securities experience further declines in fair value that are considered other-than-temporary, we will reflect the additional losses in our statement of operations in the period when the subsequent impairment becomes apparent.
The fair values of our long-term investments (consisting primarily of equity investments in privately held companies) have also declined substantially since our initial investments due to the volatility and economic downturn of the high technology industry. We recorded losses of $7.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $16.2 in fiscal 2001 and charges of $9.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $28.6 million in fiscal 2001, to write down certain long-term investments for which the decline in fair value below carrying value was other-than-temporary.
 
4. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment consisted of the following as of the dates indicated:
Capital in progress consists primarily of costs related to internal use software projects. As discussed in Note 1, "Software Development Costs," we capitalize costs related to the development of computer software for internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1. We capitalized approximately $23.4 million and $21.3 million of internal use software during fiscal 2001 and 2002, respectively. Costs related to internal use software projects are included in the capital in progress category of property and equipment until project completion, at which time they are transferred to the computer software category and amortized over their useful lives. Amortization expense for capitalized internal use software was $3.6 million in fiscal 2001 and $7.5 million in fiscal 2002. The net book value of completed capitalized internal use software was $11.3 million at July 31, 2001 and $15.6 million at July 31, 2002.
5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets consisted of the following at the dates indicated:
Accumulated amortization of intangible assets declined during fiscal 2002 due to the retirement of certain fully amortized intangible assets.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142, "." We adopted SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. As a result, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Most other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, effective August 1, 2002 we transferred the net balance of $1.9 million for assembled workforce to goodwill and will no longer amortize that intangible asset. See Note 1.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
We summarize the following expenses on the "acquisition-related charges" line of our statement of operations:
As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired. We look for the existence of facts and circumstances, either internal or external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.
Fiscal 2001
During fiscal 2001, events and circumstances indicated possible impairment of certain long-lived assets, consisting principally of acquired intangible assets and goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions of Venture Finance Software Corp. in August 2000, SecureTax.com in August 1999 and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation in August 1999. These indicators included the deterioration in the business climate for Web-based companies and management's intentions relating to the continuation of certain services provided by our Personal Finance segment.
We measured the impairment loss related to long-lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded their fair values. Our measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows, as discussed in Note 1. In performing this analysis, we used the best information available in the circumstances, including reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections. The discounted cash flow analysis considered the likelihood of possible outcomes and was based on our best estimate of projected future cash flows. For VFSC, we considered the terminal value cash flows expected to result from the disposition of the assets at the end of their useful lives. The consideration from the disposition of a portion of VFSC, our Quicken Bill Manager business, assisted management in the determination of the fair value of the remaining assets. Based on our analysis as described above, we recorded impairment charges of $51.0 million, $26.0 million, and $1.7 million, to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with VFSC, SecureTax and Hutchison, respectively. In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we reduced the carrying value of the remaining VFSC goodwill to zero (see below).
Fiscal 2002
Fiscal 2002
During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that we received in connection with our acquisitions of an Internet-based advertising business from VFSC in August 2000 (part of our Personal Finance segment) and the Site Solutions business that we acquired from Boston Light Corp. in August 1999 (part of our Small Business segment).
Indicators of impairment for our Internet-based advertising business included a steep decline in demand for online advertising reflecting the industry-wide decline in Internet advertising spending, as well as management's assessment that revenues and profitability would continue to decline in the future based on analyses and forecasts completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2002. The primary indicator of impairment for our Site Solutions business was management's decision to transition the customer base of Site Solutions and collaborate with a third party to provide the website building service. This collaboration, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, eliminated our use of technology purchased from Boston Light.
In each case, we measured the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded their fair value based on lower projected profits and decreases in cash flow. Our measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows as discussed in Note 1. Based on our analyses, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded charges of $22.6 million ($17.4 million to acquisition-related charges
 
and $5.2 million to amortization of purchased software) to reduce the carrying value of the assets associated with our Internet-based advertising business to zero, and a charge of $4.7 million ($4.6 million to acquisition-related charges and $0.1 million to amortization of purchased software) to reduce the carrying value of assets relating to our Site Solutions business to zero.
6. Comprehensive Net Income (Loss)
SFAS 130, "" establishes standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive net income (loss) and its components in stockholders' equity. SFAS 130 requires the components of other comprehensive income (loss) such as changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities and foreign translation adjustments to be added to our net income (loss) to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) items have no impact on our net income (loss) as presented in our statement of operations.
Reporting Comprehensive Income,
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, were as follows:
 
7. Deferred Stock-based Compensation
When we assume unvested stock options in connection with acquisitions, we record deferred stock compensation as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The amount recorded is equal to the difference between the exercise price of the options related to future vesting periods and the fair market value of Intuit stock as of the closing date of the acquisition. When we grant restricted stock to employees that is subject to vesting, we also record deferred stock compensation equal to the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Deferred stock compensation is amortized straight-line over the vesting term of these options and restricted stock grants.
The following table summarizes the activity in deferred stock-based compensation:
8. Per Share Data
     We compute basic income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options under the treasury stock method. In loss periods, basic and dilutive loss per share are identical since the effect of common equivalent shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded.
     The following table presents the numerators and denominators and the computation of basic and diluted income or loss per share for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002:
 
The effect of options to purchase 2.3 million and 8.3 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted income per share for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2002, respectively, because the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of common stock. For fiscal 2001, we excluded options to purchase 14.6 million shares of common stock in our diluted loss per share computation because we experienced a net loss for the year.
9. Acquisitions
In December 1999, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Rock Financial Corporation ("RFC"), a provider of consumer mortgages, and Title Source Inc., a title insurance and escrow company affiliated with RFC, in exchange for the issuance of approximately $370.0 million or 8.8 million shares of Intuit common stock. RFC subsequently changed its name to Quicken Loans Inc. These acquisitions were accounted for as pooling of interests in accordance with APB 16. In July 2002 we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. See Note 11.
The acquisitions described below have been accounted for as purchase transactions and, accordingly, the results of operations and financial position of the acquired businesses are included in Intuit's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the difference between the purchase price and the net book value of
 
acquired tangible assets between identified tangible assets and goodwill. Identified intangible assets consist of customer lists, covenants not to compete, purchased technology, assembled workforce and trade names and logos.
Fiscal 2000
In fiscal 2000, we acquired Boston Light Software Corp., SecureTax.com, and Turning Mill Software, Inc. We purchased all of the outstanding common and Series A preferred stock of Boston Light, a developer of software and Web-based products for small businesses based in Massachusetts, for approximately $33.5 million in Intuit common stock. In connection with the agreement, Intuit also assumed 482,910 of Boston Light's outstanding employee stock options, which were converted into options to purchase 160,970 shares of Intuit common stock. We acquired all of the outstanding common stock of SecureTax, a developer of online tax preparation and electronic filing services based in Georgia, for approximately $52.0 million in cash. We also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Turning Mill, a developer of software and Web-based products headquartered in Massachusetts, for approximately $22.1 million in Intuit common stock.
Fiscal 2001
In fiscal 2001, we purchased all of the outstanding securities of Venture Finance Software Corp. which were not already held by Intuit (approximately 51%) for approximately $118.0 million in cash (including approximately $4.5 million in option exercise and tax payments in connection with VFSC options exercised immediately prior to the purchase). We also purchased all of the outstanding stock of EmployeeMatters, Inc., in exchange for approximately $41.9 million in Intuit common stock, the elimination of approximately $8.0 million in bridge loans we extended to EmployeeMatters prior to the closing, and the assumption of approximately $3.4 million in liabilities. We acquired substantially all of the assets of Tax Accounting and Software Corporation for $63.0 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $7.8 million in liabilities.
Fiscal 2002
In November 2001, we acquired substantially all of the assets of OMware, Inc. for $35.5 million or 924,973 shares of Intuit common stock, approximately $2.1 million in the assumption of debt and bridge loans and up to $8 million in Intuit common stock to be issued contingent upon the achievement of future performance objectives by the business unit. OMware provides business management software solutions for construction companies. Pursuant to separate agreements, Intuit will pay up to $2 million in cash over two years as part of a senior management performance program. These amounts will be recorded as compensation expense as amounts are earned. With the assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately $27.1 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $8.5 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over five years.
In May 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding stock of The Flagship Group for approximately $23.3 million or 455,259 shares of Intuit common stock, the assumption of $4.7 million in debt and $3.3 million in cash. Flagship is the parent company of American Fundware, Inc., which offers financial accounting solutions for nonprofit organizations. In connection with the agreement, we also assumed Flagship's outstanding employee stock options for 1,204,000 shares of Flagship common stock, which were converted into options to purchase 130,316 shares of Intuit common stock. With the assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately $29.6 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $4.2 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from three to twelve years.
In June 2002, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of CBS Employer Services, Inc. for approximately $75.3 million in cash (of which $25.4 million is unpaid but accrued at July 31, 2002) and $3.2 million or 73,795 shares of Intuit common stock. CBS is a provider of full-service outsourced payroll functions for small businesses. In connection with the agreement, we also assumed CBS's outstanding employee stock options for 665,504 shares of CBS common stock, which were converted into options to purchase 193,891 shares of Intuit common stock. With the assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately $74.8 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $9.3 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from five to six years.
In July 2002, we purchased all of the outstanding stock of Management Reports, Inc. for approximately $92.2 million in cash. MRI provides business management software solutions for commercial and residential property managers. We recorded the transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 based on estimated financial information, which was not materially different from the final information that became available in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. With the assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately $73.4 million of the
 
purchase price to goodwill and $14.0 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from five to seven years.
In July 2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Eclipse, Inc. for approximately $88.3 million in cash. Eclipse provides business management software solutions for wholesale durable goods distributors. We recorded the transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 based on estimated financial information, which was not materially different from the final information that became available in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. With the assistance of a professional valuation services firm, we allocated approximately $41.4 million of the purchase price to goodwill and $35.8 million of the purchase price to identified intangible assets. The identified intangible assets are being amortized over terms ranging from one to seven years.
The following table shows net revenue, income (loss) from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change, net income (loss) and basic and diluted net income (loss) per share as they would have been if we had completed the fiscal 2002 acquisitions on August 1, 2000. Because the pro forma acquisition date is prior to June 30, 2001, these figures include the effects of amortization of goodwill and other identified intangible assets from the date of acquisition through July 31, 2002. Under the provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill amortization would cease on August 1, 2002. This unaudited summary information is presented for illustrative purposes and is not necessarily indicative of results that would have actually occurred had these acquisitions taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2001.
 
Purchase prices for the acquisitions described above have been allocated on the basis of their fair values on the acquisition dates as follows:
Deferred stock compensation is recorded in stockholders' equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using the straight-line method. Until July 31, 2002, goodwill was amortized over estimated useful lives which ranged from three to five years. We implemented SFAS 142 on August 1, 2002. As a result, goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Most other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to fifteen years. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, effective August 1, 2002 we transferred the net balance of $1.9 million for assembled workforce to goodwill and will no longer amortize that intangible asset. See Notes 1 and 5.
Of the total goodwill acquired in fiscal 2000, none was deductible for income tax purposes. Of the total goodwill acquired in fiscal 2001 and 2002, $148,950 and $115,031, respectively, were deductible for income tax purposes.
The following table presents acquired goodwill by reportable business segment:
10. Divestitures
In January 2001, we sold certain assets of our Quicken Insurance business to InsWeb Corporation for approximately $10.8 million of InsWeb common stock. As a result of the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $1.6 million and a related tax provision of $0.6 million in fiscal 2001.
In May 2001, we sold the stock of Venture Finance Software Corp., which held the technology assets of our Quicken Bill Manager business, to Princeton eCom Corporation. In exchange for these assets, Intuit was entitled to receive, at Princeton eCom's election, either approximately 20% of Princeton eCom fully diluted common stock or cash payments of a minimum of $37 million or a combination of stock and cash. In connection with this disposition, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16.9 million and a related tax benefit of $6.4 million in fiscal 2001. At July 31, 2001, our contractual right to receive payment was valued at $27 million. In fiscal 2002, we determined that this asset was impaired and recorded a charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment to its fair value of zero. See Note 12.
In March 2002, we paid $12.0 million to terminate our $20.3 million obligation under an interactive services agreement related to our Quicken Bill Manager business. When we terminated this agreement, we recorded a pre-tax non-operating gain of $8.3 million and related tax expense of $2.7 million in fiscal 2002.
 
 
11.
Discontinued Operations
Quicken Loans
We acquired our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests in December 1999. See Note 9. On July 31, 2002, we sold that business to a company called BRFC LLC. We transferred all of our capital stock in Quicken Loans Inc. and Title Source, Inc. to Rock Acquisition Corporation ("Rock"), a newly-created corporation, then subsequently sold all of the voting stock of Rock to BRFC. The voting stock represented 87.5% of Rock's total outstanding common stock. We retain a 12.5% non-voting equity interest in Rock and our investment will be accounted for on a cost basis since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence.
Prior to July 31, 2002, Quicken Loans Inc. and Title Source, Inc. repaid all outstanding intercompany balances and the net tangible shareholders' equity in excess of $33.0 million to Intuit. We received $33.0 million from BFRC and a five-year secured promissory note in the principal amount of $23.3 million from Rock as consideration. The note will be repayable earlier if Rock achieves certain financial performance targets. We will earn market interest rates on the promissory note, which is recorded as a long-term note receivable in other assets on the balance sheet.
Rock continues to offer loans under the Quicken Loans brand and is licensing from Intuit the use of the Quicken Loans trademark for its residential home loan and home equity loan products. We will receive a minimum royalty of $1.8 million a year for each of the next five years under this licensing agreement. In addition, we entered into a five-year distribution agreement under which Quicken Loans will provide mortgage services on Quicken.com. We will receive a minimum fee of $0.8 million a year under this distribution agreement. The royalties from the licensing agreement and the fees from the distribution agreement will be recorded as earned and included in other income on our statement of operations. We have also agreed to continue providing a line of credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for a transition period of up to six months. The line expires on January 31, 2003. The line of credit is secured by the related mortgage loans and the interest rate is based on the six-month LIBOR rate plus 1.5%. The balance outstanding on this line of credit of $245.6 million at July 31, 2002 is included on our balance sheet under amounts due from discontinued operations entities.
We accounted for the sale of Quicken Loans as discontinued operations. In accordance with APB Opinion No. 30, the net assets, operating results and cash flows of Quicken Loans have been segregated from continuing operations in our balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. We did not record the tax benefit related to the gain on the transaction because we cannot be assured that we will realize the tax benefit. We recorded the transaction based on preliminary financial information, which is subject to change based on an audit of the final tangible shareholders' equity balance of Quicken Loans.
Intuit KK
On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to Advantage Partners, Inc., a private equity investment firm located in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, Advantage Partners purchased 100 percent of the outstanding Intuit KK stock for 9.5 billion yen or approximately $79 million as of February 7, 2003.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we determined that Intuit KK became a long-lived asset held for sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 because management put a plan in place to sell this asset which met the conditions specified in the pronouncement. SFAS 144 provides that a long-lived asset classified as held for sale should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit KK at January 31, 2003 was significantly lower than the fair value, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Also in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144, we determined that Intuit KK became a discontinued operation during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The net assets, operating results and cash flows of Intuit KK have therefore been segregated from continuing operations in our balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows for all periods presented.
"Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,"
In December 2002, in order to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the sale proceeds during the period between the announcement of the sale of Intuit KK and the closing of the transaction, we entered into a foreign currency hedge contract to sell 9.5 billion Japanese yen in February 2003.
 
Discontinued Operations Net Revenue and Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Before Income Taxes
Net revenue and income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes for the periods presented were as follows:
 
12.
Loss on Impairment of Long-lived Asset
In connection with the sale of our Quicken Bill Manager business in May 2001, we acquired a $27.0 million long-term asset related to future consideration from Princeton eCom which was recorded as other assets on the balance sheet at July 31, 2001. See Note 10.
As discussed in Note 1, we regularly perform reviews to determine if the carrying values of our long-lived assets are impaired. We look for facts or circumstances, either internal or external, that indicate that the carrying value of an asset cannot be recovered. During fiscal 2002, events and circumstances indicated impairment of this asset. These indicators included the deterioration of Princeton eCom's financial position (including cash flows and liquidity) and the decreased likelihood that it would receive future funding. We considered the implied fair value of our investment based on Princeton eCom's most recent round of planned funding, as well as the fair value of our investment if funding were received. Based on our analysis we recorded a charge of $27.0 million in fiscal 2002 to reduce the carrying value of this asset to its fair value of zero.
 
13.
Charge for Vacant Facilities
During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we concluded that we would not occupy two vacant leased buildings in Mountain View, California and that we would be unable to recover a substantial portion of our lease obligations by subleasing the vacant space. The resulting $13.2 million charge was equal to the remaining future lease commitments for these facilities, net of estimated future sublease income. The estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities reflected management's best estimates based on market information and trend analyses compiled by our facilities management team with the help of a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by Intuit.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we made cash lease payments for these two buildings of $0.6 million, reducing the original $13.2 million reserve to a balance of $12.6 million at July 31, 2002. The short-term portion of the reserve is in other current liabilities and the long-term portion is in long-term obligations on our balance sheet. The total reserve is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal 2010. Our actual future cash payments may exceed the total reserve balance by a maximum of $3.7 million if we are unable to sublease either of the properties.

Industry Segment and Geographic Information
SFAS 131, "" establishes standards for the way in which public companies disclose certain information about operating segments in the company's financial reports. Due to the sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment as well as to several acquisitions during fiscal 2002, we have reevaluated our operating segments. Consistent with SFAS 131, we have defined seven operating segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. All operating segments except Global Business are based in the United States and sell primarily to customers located there. We have reclassified prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation for comparability.

See Note 9.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Intuit does not track assets by operating segments and, consequently, does not disclose assets by operating segments. The following results for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 are broken out by our operating segments.

Other Current Liabilities
Other current liabilities at July 31, 2001 and 2002 were as follows:
 
 
16.
Commitments
Intuit leases office facilities and equipment under various operating lease agreements. The leases provide for annual rent increases of up to 10%. Annual minimum commitments under these leases are shown in the table below. The table includes leases for two vacant facilities in Mountain View, California and excludes any potential future sublease income for those facilities. See Note 13.
Total lease expense for the years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 was approximately $18.6 million, $23.2 million, and $23.9 million, respectively. Lease expense for fiscal 2002 does not include a charge of $13.2 million for the two vacant facilities referred to above. See Note 13.
In connection with the sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business in July 2002, we agreed to continue providing a line of credit of up to $375.0 million to fund mortgage loans for the purchasing company for a transition period of up to six months. The line of credit is secured by the related mortgage loans. The balance outstanding on this line of credit of $245.6 million at July 31, 2002 is included on our balance sheet under amounts due from discontinued operations entities. See Note 11.
 
17.
Stockholders' Equity
Stock Option Plans
On February 1, 1993, our stockholders adopted the 1993 Equity Incentive Plan. The 1993 Plan terminated on January 18, 2002 when our stockholders approved our 2002 Equity Incentive Plan. In connection with our adoption of the 2002 Plan (described below), we transferred 1,900,000 of the shares remaining available for grant under the 1993 Plan to the 2002 Plan and we ceased making new grants under the 1993 Plan. We removed the remaining 1,909,906 shares available for grant under the 1993 Plan from the pool of options available for grant when the plan terminated. All outstanding options under the 1993 Plan remain in effect in accordance with their terms. Under the 1993 Plan, we were permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses to employees, directors, consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or its delegees determined who would receive grants, exercisability, exercise price and other terms. The option exercise price was generally the fair market value at the date of grant. The outstanding options generally vest over four years based on continued service and expire after ten years.
On October 7, 1996, we adopted the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan. This plan provides for non-qualified stock options for a specified number of shares to be granted to all non-employee directors of Intuit. As of December 2001, Board members who serve on the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee receive additional annual grants. The option exercise price equals the fair market value at the date of grant. Most options are subject to vesting over time based on continued service, with vesting periods ranging from two to four years. All options expire after ten years.
On November 11, 1998, we adopted the 1998 Option Plan for Mergers and Acquisitions. Under the 1998 Plan, we may grant non-qualified stock options to individuals who we hire as a result of our acquisitions of, or mergers with, other companies. The 1998 Plan was designed to meet the "broadly based plans" exemption from the stockholder approval requirement for stock option plans under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements at the time the plan was adopted and, accordingly, has not been submitted to Intuit stockholders for approval. Options under the 1998 Plan can only be granted to eligible individuals within 18 months following the completion of the relevant acquisition or merger. Options granted under the 1998 Plan have an exercise price not less than the fair market value of Intuit's common stock on the date of grant. During fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option vesting schedule so that future options granted generally become exercisable over a three-year period based on continued service and expire seven years after the grant date. Prior to that change, options generally vested over four years and
 
expired ten years after the grant date. Options granted to officers hired as a result of a merger or acquisition cannot exceed 45% of all shares reserved for grant under the 1998 Plan.
On January 18, 2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan. Under the 2002 Plan, we may grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses to employees, directors, consultants, and independent contractors of and advisors to Intuit. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or its delegees determines who will receive grants, exercisability, exercise price and other terms. The option exercise price is generally the fair market value at the date of grant. During fiscal 2002, Intuit changed its standard option vesting schedule so that future options granted generally become exercisable over a three-year period based on continued service and expire seven years after the grant date. Prior to that change, options vested over four years and expired ten years after the grant date.
In addition, in several instances we have assumed the outstanding options of companies that we acquired. Intuit granted no further options under the acquired companies' option plans after the date of acquisition. We assumed options in connection with our acquisitions of Boston Light Software Corp. and Hutchison Avenue Software Corporation in August 1999, Rock Financial Corporation in December 1999, EmployeeMatters, Inc. in January 2001, The Flagship Group in May 2002 and CBS Employer Services, Inc. in June 2002.
 
A summary of activity under all option plans is as follows:
We define net option grants as options granted less options canceled or expired and returned to the pool of options available for grant. For fiscal 2000, net option grants were 5,835,786 shares or 2.9% of the 204,299,955 shares outstanding at July 31, 2000. Net option grants for fiscal 2001 were 9,880,453 shares or 4.7% of the 210,526,239 shares outstanding at July 31, 2001. Net option grants for fiscal 2002 were 6,825,109 shares or 3.2% of the 211,163,641 shares outstanding at July 31, 2002. If net option grants are calculated by subtracting both canceled or expired options that were returned to the pool of options available for grant and options canceled from expired plans, net option grants were 5,264,006 shares or 2.6% of outstanding shares in fiscal 2000, 9,689,233 shares or 4.6% of outstanding shares in fiscal 2001 and 4,460,969 shares or 2.1% of outstanding shares in fiscal 2002.
There were 11,608,020, 15,551,666 and 18,264,940 options exercisable under the various plans at July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. At July 31, 2002, there were 171,875 shares available for grant under the 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan, 2,134,701 shares available for grant under the 1998 Plan and 8,086,912 shares available for grant under the 2002 Plan.
 
The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of July 31, 2002:
Stock Split
Intuit's Board of Directors authorized a three-for-one stock split on September 8, 1999. This was effected by distributing a 200% stock dividend on September 30, 1999 to stockholders of record on September 20, 1999. We have restated all share and per share amounts referred to in the financial statements and notes to reflect this stock split.
Stock Repurchase Program
In May 2001, Intuit's Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of common stock from time to time over a three-year period. In July 2002, our Board of Directors increased the authorized purchase amount by $250.0 million. Shares of stock repurchased under the program become treasury shares. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we repurchased 238,500 shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately $8.4 million. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased 7,361,839 shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately $318.4 million. During fiscal 2002, we reissued 4,621,793 million shares of treasury stock in connection with employee stock plans.
When we reissue treasury shares, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.
Repurchases through July 31, 2002 have had no significant impact on our net income or loss per share. Intuit intends to continue using its cash and cash equivalents to fund these repurchases.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In October 1996, Intuit adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. A total of 3,800,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the plan. The plan allows eligible employees to purchase Intuit's stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of each 12-month offering period or at the end of the applicable six-month purchase period. During fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 employees purchased 355,281, 469,873 and 583,990 shares, respectively. At July 31, 2002, there were 1,261,479 shares available for issuance under this plan.
Stock-Based Compensation
We follow APB Opinion No. 25, "," in accounting for stock-based compensation. Accordingly, we are not required to record compensation expense when stock options are granted to employees, as long as the exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option is granted,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
and we are not required to record compensation expense in connection with the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as long as the purchase price is not less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of each 12-month offering period or at the end of each applicable six-month purchase period. In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS 123, "." Although SFAS 123 allows us to continue to follow the present APB 25 guidelines, we are required to disclose pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share as if we had adopted SFAS 123. The pro forma impact of applying SFAS 123 in fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 will not necessarily be representative of the pro forma impact in future years.
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
We have elected to use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of options granted. This valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect this estimate, we believe the Black-Scholes model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options. Inputs used for the valuation model are as follows:
Our pro forma net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share would have been as follows if we had adopted SFAS 123 and recorded compensation expense for our stock option plans and Employee Purchase Plan in accordance with its provisions:
The weighted average fair values of options granted during fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 were approximately $23.27, $21.77 and $20.31, respectively.
 
18.
Performance Sharing and Benefit Plans
Performance Sharing Plan
Eligible employees participate in Intuit's performance sharing plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines aggregate amounts to be paid under the plan. Performance-sharing expense for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002 was approximately $20.7 million, $21.9 million and $17.6 million, respectively.
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
Intuit adopted the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan effective March 15, 2002. The plan allows executives who meet minimum compensation requirements to defer up to 50% of their salaries and up to 100% of their bonuses and commissions. We have agreed to credit the participants' contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts. The timing, amounts and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at our sole discretion. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest
 
completely upon the participant's disability, death or a change of control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan during fiscal 2002.
Benefit Plans
Employees who participate in the Intuit 401(k) Plan may contribute up to 20% of pre-tax salary to the plan, subject to IRS limitations. Intuit matches a specified portion of the employee contributions up to a maximum amount per employee per year. The amount is subject to change on an annual basis. At July 31, 2001 and 2002, the match was 75%, up to $2,500. Matching contributions were approximately $6.6 million, $6.9 million and $8.4 million, respectively, for the years ended July 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002. Participating employees age 50 or older may make catch-up contributions. These contributions are not matched.
 
19.
Stockholder Rights Plan
On April 29, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan designed to protect the long-term value of Intuit for its stockholders during any future unsolicited acquisition attempt. In connection with the plan, the Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of Intuit's common stock outstanding on May 11, 1998 (the "Record Date") and further directed the issuance of one such right with respect to each share of Intuit's common stock that is issued after the Record Date, except in certain circumstances. If a person or a group (an "Acquiring Person") acquires 20% or more of Intuit's common stock, or announces an intention to make a tender offer for Intuit's common stock, the consummation of which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person, then the rights will be distributed (the "Distribution Date"). After the Distribution Date, each right may be exercised for 1/3000th of a share of a newly designated Series B Junior Participating Preferred stock at an exercise price of approximately $83.33 per share. The preferred stock has been structured so that the value of 1/3000th of a share of such preferred stock will approximate the value of one share of common stock. The rights will expire on May 1, 2008. In July 2002, we adopted a policy that requires an independent committee of our Board of Directors to review the rights plan at least once every three years to consider whether maintaining the rights plan continues to be in the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders.
 
20.
Income Taxes
Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included income (loss) from foreign operations of $7.9 million, $4.6 million and $8.0 million for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:
 
Differences between income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 35% and the provision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations were as follows:
Tax savings from deductions associated with our various stock option plans are not reflected in the current federal and state provisions. Savings were approximately $93.5 million in fiscal 2000, $59.5 million in fiscal 2001 and $53.2 million in fiscal 2002. These amounts were credited to stockholders' equity and reduced taxes payable.
Significant deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
We have provided a valuation reserve related to the benefits of losses in our foreign subsidiaries and certain state capital loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by $0.2 million in fiscal 2000, did not change in fiscal 2001 and decreased by $4.7 million in fiscal 2002.
At July 31, 2002, we had U.S. federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $26.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. These net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2005 if not utilized. At July 31, 2002, we also had various state tax credit carryforwards totaling approximately $13.8 million. The state credit carryforwards have no expiration date. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.
 
21.
Litigation
On March 3, 2000, a class action lawsuit, Bruce v. Intuit Inc., was filed in the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. Two virtually identical lawsuits were later filed: Rubin v. Intuit Inc., was filed on March 8, 2000 in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York and Newby v. Intuit Inc. was filed on April 27, 2000, in the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. The Bruce and Newby lawsuits were consolidated into one lawsuit, In re Intuit Privacy Litigation, filed on July 28, 2000 in the United States District Court, Central District of California, Eastern Division. Following Intuit's successful motion to dismiss several of the claims, an amended complaint was filed on May 2, 2001. A similar lawsuit, Almanza v. Intuit Inc. was filed on March 22, 2000 in the Superior Court of the State of California, San Bernardino
 
County, Rancho Cucamonga Division. An amended complaint in the Almanza suit was filed on October 26, 2000. These purported class actions alleged violations of various federal and California statutes and common law claims for invasion of privacy based upon the alleged intentional disclosure to third parties of personal and private customer information entered at Intuit's Quicken.com Web site. The complaints sought injunctive relief, orders to disgorge profits related to the alleged acts, and statutory and other damages. In August 2001, Intuit and the plaintiffs' counsel in all of the cases except Rubin reached an agreement in principle to resolve the cases, subject to court approval, based on terms that are not material to Intuit. The Rubin case was dismissed on November 19, 2001.
Intuit is subject to other routine legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business. We currently believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. However, the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, and either unfavorable or favorable outcomes could have a material negative impact. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
 
22.
Related Party Transactions
We participated in the formation of Venture Finance Software Corp. in May 1998 in order to facilitate the development of certain Web-oriented finance products. At July 31, 2000, we held a 49% non-voting equity interest in VFSC. We entered into agreements with VFSC to provide it with services related to on-going development of Web-oriented finance products and received cost reimbursements of approximately $23.8 million in fiscal 2000 for development and administrative services provided in connection with this agreement. In August 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding securities of VFSC. See Note 9. In May 2001, we sold certain technology assets acquired from VFSC to Princeton eCom Corporation. See Note 10.
Loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2001 and 2002 were as follows:
Loans to executive officers are primarily relocation loans. Of the total loans to executive officers at July 31, 2002, $9.5 million accrue no interest for either the term of the note or for up to four years. The remaining loans to executive officers at July 31, 2002 accrue interest at rates equal to the applicable federal rates in effect at the time the loans were made. Of the total outstanding loans to executive officers and other employees at July 31, 2002, loans with a remaining principal balance of $20.2 million are secured by real property. The loans have terms which range from one to ten years.
 
23.
Selected Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data (Unaudited)
The following tables contain selected quarterly consolidated financial data for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. We accounted for the July 2002 sale of our Quicken Loans mortgage business segment and the February 2003 sale of our Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, as discontinued operations. As a result, the operating results of Quicken Loans and Intuit KK have been segregated from continuing operations in our consolidated financial statements and in these tables. See Note 11.
 
 
24.
Subsequent Event (Unaudited)
On September 13, 2002, we completed the purchase of Blue Ocean Software, Inc. for approximately $170.0 million in cash. Blue Ocean offers software solutions that help businesses manage their information technology resources and assets. Intuit plans to operate Blue Ocean as a separate business unit under its Small Business division led by Blue Ocean's chief executive officer and headquartered in Tampa, Florida.

ITEM 9. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
     On May 14, 2003, Intuit Inc. announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2003 and certain other information. A copy of the press release is attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.01.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, and refers to them as "pro forma." Intuit computes its pro forma financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Intuit's pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies.
     Intuit's management believes that these pro forma measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Pro forma financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the historical and forward-looking pro forma financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are in Tables B1, B2 and D to the attached press release.
     The information required by Form 8-K, Item 12  Results of Operations and Financial Condition, is being provided under Item 9 pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-8216. The information in this Report and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.

(650) 944-5436 (650) 944-3501 or Jennifer Fellner Access PR for Intuit (415) 844-6275 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE INTUIT'S THIRD-QUARTER 2003 REVENUE GROWS 29 PERCENT TurboTax Growth Outpaces Category for Federal Tax Software MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. -- MAY 14, 2003 -- Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) today announced results for its third fiscal quarter, which ended April 30, 2003. - REVENUE OF $634.7 MILLION INCREASED 29 PERCENT from the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Growth was driven primarily by strong gains in Intuit's TurboTax business as an increasing portion of consumer tax revenue shifted from the second to the third quarter. Intuit's Small Business Products and Services business also had strong year-over-year growth. - INTUIT'S THIRD-QUARTER PRO FORMA NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS $220.3 MILLION, UP 46 PERCENT from the year-earlier period. Pro forma diluted earnings per share of $1.05 was up 52 percent over the year-ago period. (See Table B1 for a reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.) - ON A GAAP BASIS, INTUIT HAD NET INCOME OF $294.0 MILLION, UP 103 PERCENT from $144.5 million in the year-earlier period. This represents $1.40 per diluted share, up 109 percent from $0.67 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. This quarter's GAAP results benefited from stronger revenue growth as well as a $71.0 million after-tax gain on the sale of its Japanese subsidiary. "Intuit is a strong, growing and profitable company, as evidenced again by our solid quarterly results," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "We have a great portfolio of businesses with tremendous growth opportunities. And we're working to improve our execution and getting better every day."
BUSINESS UNIT REVENUE GROWTH - TURBOTAX REVENUE OF $313.1 MILLION WAS UP 28 PERCENT from the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Year-to-date TurboTax revenue of $414.4 million was up 24 percent. - REVENUE FROM INTUIT'S PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTING SOLUTIONS BUSINESS INCREASED 12 PERCENT over the third quarter of fiscal 2002 to $81.2 million. - INTUIT'S SMALL BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 41 PERCENT over the year-ago quarter to $114.7 million. This unit includes payroll, supplies, technical support and information technology solutions. - QUICKBOOKS REVENUE GREW 12 PERCENT over the third-quarter of fiscal 2002 to $55.2 million as Intuit continues to execute its Right for My Business strategy. Revenue has increased 18 percent year-to-date. - INTUIT'S VERTICAL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS UNIT CONTRIBUTED $25.7 MILLION in revenue in the third quarter, a 7 percent increase over the revenue those companies generated in the year-earlier period. - REVENUE FROM OTHER BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDES QUICKEN AND CANADA, WAS $44.8 MILLION, up 16 percent over third-quarter fiscal 2002. INTUIT COMPLETES ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL TURBOTAX SEASON Intuit completed another strong tax season, with revenue up 28 percent for the quarter and 24 percent year-to-date. Total paid TurboTax federal units were 8.5 million, up 12 percent over last season. According to the IRS, individual returns prepared by software -- both on the desktop and Web -- grew only 8 percent, slower than Intuit's growth. "All in all, this was a solid tax season for us," said Bennett. "We grew faster than the industry and were successful in driving customers to new, higher-end offerings, though product activation didn't perform as we'd expected. Intuit has a long heritage of doing right by customers, and some of our customers didn't have the great experience they expect from Intuit. In addition, we didn't get the revenue and profit growth we expected. Therefore, we've decided to discontinue product activation next season." Bennett noted
that next year, the company would include in-product technology to unlock marketing and trial versions of TurboTax products. FORWARD-LOOKING GUIDANCE FOR FOURTH-QUARTER AND FISCAL 2003 Intuit's guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 is: - Revenue of $240 million-$250 million, or year-over-year growth of 28-34 percent. The company expects the following revenue ranges for its businesses: - QuickBooks: $53 million-$58 million. - Small Business Services: $112 million-$120 million. - TurboTax: $5 million-$8 million - Professional Accounting Solutions: $6 million-$8 million - Verticals: $24 million-$28 million - Other: $30 million-$33 million - A pro forma operating loss of $30 million-$35 million and a GAAP operating loss of $41 million-$46 million. - A pro forma net loss per diluted share of $0.06-$0.09 and a GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.10-$0.13. Adding fourth-quarter guidance to Intuit's actual results from the first three quarters, Intuit's guidance for fiscal 2003 is: - Revenue of $1.65 billion-$1.66 billion, or year-over-year growth of 25-26 percent. - Pro forma operating income of $395 million-$400 million, or growth of 44-46 percent over fiscal 2002. This corresponds to GAAP operating income of $338 million-$343 million. - Pro forma EPS of $1.36-$1.39, or year-over-year growth of 48-51 percent. This corresponds to GAAP EPS of $1.61-$1.64. Pro forma EPS guidance has been adjusted to reflect the strength of third-quarter results. FORWARD-LOOKING GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2004 Intuit also provided its guidance for fiscal 2004, which begins Aug. 1, 2003: - Revenue of $1.85 billion-$1.95 billion, or year-over-year growth of approximately 12-18 percent. Intuit's fiscal 2003 year-over-year revenue growth
benefits from acquisitions the company made the prior year. - Pro forma operating income of $480 million-$510 million, or growth of approximately 21-28 percent over fiscal 2003. On a GAAP basis, operating income is expected to be $449 million-$479 million, or growth of approximately 32-41 percent over fiscal 2003. - Pro forma diluted earnings per share of $1.57-$1.67, or growth of approximately 14-21 percent over fiscal 2003. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS is expected to be $1.47-$1.57, down approximately 3-10 percent from fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 GAAP EPS includes net income and gains from discontinued operations of nearly $80 million, which is not anticipated to recur in fiscal 2004. ABOUT PRO FORMA, OR NON-GAAP, FINANCIAL MEASURES Intuit computes its pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliations of pro forma financial measures to GAAP. CONFERENCE CALL SCRIPTS AND DIAL-IN INFORMATION The script that accompanies the Intuit earnings conference call and a live audio Web-cast of the call is available at www.intuit.com/company/investors. This press release, including the tables, is available at that site and any other supplemental financial and statistical information required to be posted, including pro forma reconciliations, will be posted to that site. The conference call number is 800-615-5585 (706-679-0331 from international locations). The call begins today at 1:30 p.m. pacific time. No reservation or access code is needed. Those planning to listen to the conference call should download the script before the call begins. A replay of the call will be available for one week by calling 800-642-1687 (706-645-9291 for international locations). The reservation number is 186346. CAUTIONS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements about future financial results and other events that have not yet occurred, including guidance about Intuit's expected results for the remainder of fiscal 2003 and for fiscal 2004. Statements with words like "expects," "anticipates" or "believes," and statements in the future tense, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from Intuit's expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future. Some of the important factors
that could cause Intuit's results to differ are listed below. More details about these and other risks are included in Intuit's SEC filings and at www.intuit.com/company/investors/considerations.html. The company does not intend to update the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate. - Seasonality causes significant quarterly fluctuations in Intuit's revenue and net income. - The reconciliation of the forward-looking pro forma financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure includes all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. The adjustments are those that management can predict. Intuit's pro forma financial measures exclude acquisition-related charges, discontinued operations and gains and losses on marketable securities. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable securities. - Actual product returns may exceed product return reserves, particularly for Intuit's tax preparation software. - If Intuit fails to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for its electronic tax offerings or customer support function, it could lose revenue and customers. - Integrating acquired businesses creates challenges for Intuit's operational, financial and management information systems. If Intuit is unable to adequately address these and other issues presented by acquisitions, Intuit may not fully realize the intended benefits of its acquisitions. - Expansion of Intuit's product and service offerings requires Intuit to develop and enhance more and increasingly complex products, market and sell higher-priced products and services and distribute and support an expanding portfolio of products and services. It also increases the number and complexity of Intuit's revenue models. If Intuit is unable to support its expanded businesses, they may not achieve sustainable financial viability or broad customer acceptance. - Intuit faces competitive pressures in all of its businesses, which can have a negative impact on its revenue, profitability and market position. - Acquisition-related charges can substantially reduce Intuit's net income, and cause significant fluctuations in net income. - Risks related to Intuit's distribution channels include challenges in negotiating favorable terms with retailers and the negative effect of the current economic environment on retail sales. In addition, expansion of certain of Intuit's product and service offerings requires Intuit to develop and manage a direct sales organization, which is a new distribution method for Intuit. - If Intuit does not provide accurate and timely services in its employer services businesses, it faces potential liability to customers, additional expense to correct product errors and loss of customers. - Revenue growth for Intuit's vertical business management solutions is subject to risks such as the negative impact of the current economic environment and the potential disruption to the businesses during the acquisition integration process. - If revenue from consumer tax products continues to shift to the third fiscal quarter, there will be increased uncertainty for the full tax season. - Risks relating to customer privacy and security and increasing governmental regulation could hinder the growth of Intuit's businesses.

NOTES TO TABLES A1, B1 AND B2: i. There is a difference in the effective tax rate for each of these periods, primarily due to the net effect of non-deductible merger and divestiture related charges offset by the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income and various tax credits. ii. Tables B1 and B2 reconcile the differences between the pro forma or non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and the GAAP condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2002 and 2003. Pro forma operating income (loss) excludes certain cost and expense line items that are in the GAAP statement of operations. For example, for the line item "acquisition-related charges," the number in the GAAP column is subtracted out of the pro forma column in calculating pro forma operating income or loss. Eliminating cost or expense items increases pro forma results compared to GAAP results. Pro forma net income (loss) starts with pro forma operating income or loss and then excludes certain non-operating gains and losses that are in the GAAP statement of operations. For example, for the line item "gains (losses) on marketable securities and other investments, net" the number in the GAAP column is taken out of the pro forma column in calculating pro forma net income or loss. Eliminating loss line items increases pro forma results compared to GAAP results. Eliminating gain line items decreases pro forma results compared to GAAP results. iii. Acquisition-related charges include amortization of goodwill and intangible assets as well as impairment charges. For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2002, amortization of goodwill was $29.2 million and $93.4 million, amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation was $8.3 million and $25.1 million, and there were $22.0 million in impairment charges. For the three and nine months ended April 30, 2003, there was no goodwill amortization due to the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 on August 1, 2002. Amortization of intangible assets and deferred compensation during those periods was $8.4 million and $27.0 million, and there were no impairment charges. iv. On July 31, 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business to Rock Acquisition Corporation. We accounted for the sale as discontinued operations and, accordingly, the operating results of Quicken Loans have been segregated from continuing operations on our statement of operations for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2002. Income taxes netted against net income from discontinued operations amounted to $5.6 million and $20.5 million for those periods. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we sold our residual minority equity interest in Rock and recorded a gain of $5.6 million. v. On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, to a private equity investment firm located in Japan for 9.5 billion yen or approximately $79.0 million. Intuit KK became a long-lived asset held for sale and a discontinued operation during the second quarter of fiscal 2003 and, accordingly, its operating results have been segregated from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods presented. Income tax benefits included in net income from discontinued operations amounted to $0.2 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2002. Income tax expense netted against net income from discontinued operations amounted to $2.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2003. In the third quarter of fiscal 2003, there was no material income or loss from Intuit KK discontinued operations and we recorded a gain of $71.0 million on the sale, net of income taxes of $5.1 million.
TABLE C INTUIT INC. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) (Unaudited) Note: We present our balance sheet at April 30, 2002 for comparison to our balance sheet at April 30, 2003 due to the seasonality of our business. Balance sheets for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect Intuit KK as discontinued operations.
TABLE D INTUIT INC. RECONCILIATION OF GUIDANCE FOR PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES TO PROJECTED GAAP REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), AND EPS (Dollars in thousands) (Unaudited) (a) Pro forma guidance reflects estimated adjustments for amortization of purchased software of approximately $3.6 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of approximately $7.4 million for the three months ending July 31, 2003. (b) Net of income taxes, the pro forma adjustments in item (a) result in a $0.04 per diluted share adjustment for the three months ending July 31, 2003. (c) Pro forma guidance reflects estimated adjustments for amortization of purchased software of approximately $13.7 million, charge for purchased research and development of approximately $8.9 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of approximately $34.4 million for the twelve months ending July 31, 2003. (d) Pro forma diluted earnings per share reflects the adjustments in item (c) net of income taxes and adjustments net of income taxes to exclude gains on marketable securities of approximately $10.1 million, income from discontinued operations of approximately $8.8 million and gain on disposal of Intuit KK discontinued operations of approximately $71.0 million. These adjustments result in a $0.25 per diluted share adjustment for the twelve months ending July 31, 2003. (e) Pro forma guidance reflects estimated adjustments for amortization of purchased software of approximately $12.0 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of approximately $19.0 million for the twelve months ending July 31, 2004. (f) Net of income taxes, the pro forma adjustments in item (e) result in a $0.10 per diluted share adjustment for the twelve months ending July 31, 2004. THE PRO FORMA OR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ABOVE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ("GAAP"). THESE PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND LIKELY ARE DIFFERENT FROM PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. INTUIT'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THESE PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING INTUIT'S CORE OPERATING RESULTS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO INTUIT'S CORE OPERATING RESULTS.

THE RECONCILIATIONS OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP IN THIS TABLE D INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION REASONABLY AVAILABLE TO INTUIT AT THE DATE OF THIS PRESS RELEASE. THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS TABLE ARE THOSE THAT MANAGEMENT CAN PREDICT. INTUIT'S PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES. EVENTS THAT COULD CAUSE THE RECONCILIATION TO CHANGE INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

EXHIBIT 99.1
P.O. Box 7850 Mountain View, CA 94039-7850 www.intuit.com
Stephen M. Bennett
Dear Steve:
     In recognition of your importance to Intuit's continued growth and success, we are pleased to offer you this Amended and Restated Employment Agreement effective July 30, 2003 (the "Effective Date") on the terms set forth below (this "Employment Agreement").
     This Employment Agreement amends, restates and supercedes in its entirety the Employment Agreement you entered into with Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") on January 24, 2000, as such agreement has been subsequently amended (the "Prior Agreement"), except as otherwise provided in this Employment Agreement.
     1.     Position. You will remain employed by Intuit as its President and Chief Executive Officer until termination pursuant to Section 6. You will remain a member of Intuit's Board of Directors for so long as you are Intuit's President and Chief Executive Officer. You will continue to have overall responsibility for the management of Intuit and report directly to its Board of Directors. You will be expected to devote your full working time and attention to the business of Intuit, and you will not render services to any other business without the prior approval of the Board of Directors or, directly or indirectly, engage or participate in any business that is competitive in any manner with the business of Intuit. You will also be expected to comply with and be bound by the Company's operating policies, procedures and practices that are from time to time in effect during the term of your employment.
     2. Base Salary. Your base annual salary will be $990,000, payable in accordance with Intuit's normal payroll practices with such payroll deductions and withholdings as are required by law (your "Base Salary"). The Compensation Committee will review your base annual salary on an annual basis and may, in its sole discretion, increase such Base Salary.
 
     3.     Annual Performance Bonus. Your annual performance bonus will be determined pursuant to Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the "SEIP"), a cash bonus incentive plan designed to meet the performance-based compensation requirements under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Your bonus, if any, will be payable upon your attainment of one or more performance goals in accordance with the SEIP. Your bonus target will be 160% of your Base Salary. You have no minimum annual bonus commitment. Your maximum annual bonus will be no greater than $5,000,000, the maximum annual bonus payable to any one individual under the SEIP.
     4.     Equity Compensation.
     (a)  Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Award
          (1) On the Effective Date, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall grant you a stock bonus award under the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan with the following terms and conditions (the "RSU Award"). The RSU Award will be for 425,000 shares of Intuit common stock. You will vest in 255,000 of the shares of Intuit common stock subject to the RSU Award on July 31, 2006, provided you are continually employed by Intuit through that date. You will vest in an additional 85,000 of such shares on July 31, 2007, provided you are continually employed by Intuit through that date. You will vest in the final 85,000 of such shares on July 31, 2008, provided you are continuously employed by Intuit through that date. Notwithstanding the foregoing vesting schedule, in the event of (a) your "Involuntary Termination" or "Termination without Cause" (both as defined in Section 6 below), you will automatically vest pro-rata in a percentage of the total number of shares subject to the RSU Award equal to your number of full months of service since the Effective Date divided by sixty months; or (b) your "Termination Following a Change in Control" (as defined in Section 7 below), you will automatically vest as to 100% of the total number of shares of Intuit common stock subject to the RSU Award. Intuit will issue only those shares subject to the RSU Award that have vested pursuant to this Employment Agreement and the RSU Award (the "Vested RSUs"). Shares of Intuit common stock subject to the Vested RSUs will be issued to you in accordance with Section 4(a)(2) below.
          (2) Intuit will issue shares of Intuit common stock subject to the Vested RSUs on the first business day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which you cease to be both Chief Executive Officer of Intuit and a "covered employee", as defined in Section 162(m)(3) of the Code; provided, however, that you may make a one-time election until a date determined by the Compensation Committee to have Intuit issue fifty percent (50%) of the shares of Intuit common stock subject to the Vested RSUs at an earlier date. Shares of Intuit common stock subject to the Vested RSUs will be issued to you net of minimum mandatory income and payroll tax withholding.
     (b)  Future Stock Options. The Compensation Committee may, after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, award you stock options ("New Options"). These New
 
Options will be granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee under the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan or under such other then existing shareholder approved equity compensation plan. The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting schedule of the New Options on their date of grant; provided, however, that such options will vest as to 100% in the event of your death or total disability and as to 12 months if you are terminated within one year following a Corporate Transaction, as each "total disability" and Corporate Transaction are defined in the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan. You will have at least one year following the date your employment terminates for reasons other than for Cause in which to exercise any New Options to the extent such options are vested at your termination.
          (c) Future Equity Awards. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2002 Equity Incentive Plan or such other shareholder approved equity compensation plan, the Compensation Committee may, after the one-year anniversary of the Effective Date, award you other equity awards at its discretion as to the type, amount and terms of such awards.
          (d) Current Equity Awards. The two Restricted Stock Awards awarded to you under your Prior Agreement and each of your stock options granted prior to the Effective Date hereof, shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of the agreements documenting such awards and the Prior Agreement.
     5.     Other Benefits. You will be entitled to the following additional benefits:
          (a) You will continue to be eligible for the normal vacation, health insurance, 401(k), employee stock purchase plan, nonqualified deferred compensation plan and other benefits offered to all Intuit senior executives of similar rank and status.
          (b) Beginning with the fiscal year ending July 31, 2004, Intuit will make an annual fully vested employer contribution to the Intuit Executive Deferred Compensation Plan on your behalf of $50,000 for each fiscal year through July 31, 2008. The Compensation Committee may use its discretion to increase the amount of the annual contribution based on your performance for the respective fiscal year, up to a maximum annual contribution of $200,000. The contribution will not be made later than the last day of the September following the applicable fiscal year end.
          (c) Your Amended and Restated Secured Balloon Promissory Note dated November 26, 2001 and your Amended and Restated Secured Full Recourse Balloon Payment Promissory Note dated February 19, 2002 (collectively, the "Notes") will remain unchanged.

EXHIBIT 99.1
INTUIT CONFIDENTIAL
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2003, which ended July 31, 2003. The company also announced a new stock repurchase program.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Aug. 19, 2003
     "Intuit continued to execute on its recipe to drive sustained, profitable growth," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "That recipe involves being in the right businesses, executing effectively, expanding customer-driven innovation and acquiring new growth platforms. These powerful ingredients produced strong results for the quarter and year."
Fiscal 2003 Financial Highlights
 
Fiscal 2003 Business Segment Revenue Growth
Fourth-Quarter 2003 Highlights
 
Board Authorizes Intuit's New Stock Repurchase Program
     Intuit's board of directors has authorized the company's third stock repurchase program for up to $500 million in addition to the approximately $110 million that remained in Intuit's existing program at the end of fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, Intuit repurchased nearly 18 million shares for more than $800 million. The company has repurchased more than 25.5 million shares for a total of approximately $1.1 billion since its first program became effective in May 2001.
Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2004
Intuit reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 2004, which ends July 31, 2004:
Forward-Looking Guidance for First-Quarter 2004
Intuit's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 is:
About pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures
Intuit computes its pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income excludes
 
acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude the same items excluded from pro forma operating income and also exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliations of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.

Exhibit 99.01 CONTACTS: INVESTORS MEDIA Linda Fellows, VP Holly Anderson Intuit Inc. Intuit Inc. (650) 944-5436 (650) 944-3992 or Heather McLellan Intuit Inc. (650) 944-3501 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE INTUIT'S FIRST-QUARTER 2004 REVENUE GROWS 14 PERCENT Reaffirms Fiscal 2004 Guidance MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIF. - NOV. 19, 2003 -- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced results for the first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended Oct. 31, 2003. "Intuit is off to a good start for the fiscal year with solid first-quarter results," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Looking forward, we're excited about the busy tax and small business season ahead, with our new TurboTax and QuickBooks offerings hitting retail shelves in the next few weeks." FIRST-QUARTER 2004 HIGHLIGHTS - Revenue of $242.5 million increased 14 percent from the year-ago quarter. Growth was driven by strong performance in Intuit's QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management Solutions growth engines. Each of Intuit's business segments reached or exceeded the revenue targets provided three months ago. - Intuit had a pro forma net loss of $47.9 million versus a pro forma net loss of $44.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The first-quarter per share results were a pro forma net loss of $0.24 versus a pro forma net loss of $0.21 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Intuit typically reports a loss in its first quarter when revenue from its tax business is low but expenses remain constant. Revenue from Intuit's large TurboTax and professional tax business is highly seasonal and occurs in the company's second and third quarters. - On a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis, Intuit had a net loss of $54.0 million, better than a net loss of $54.7 million in the year-ago
quarter. This represents a net loss of $0.27 per diluted share, versus a net loss of $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. FIRST-QUARTER BUSINESS SEGMENT REVENUE GROWTH - QUICKBOOKS revenue grew 11 percent year-over-year to $42.8 million. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual QuickBooks revenue growth of 15 percent to 25 percent in fiscal 2004. - INTUIT'S SMALL BUSINESS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES revenue increased 22 percent over the year-ago quarter to $123.1 million. This unit includes Intuit's payroll business as well as other non-accounting products and services. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual Small Business Services revenue growth of 15 percent to 25 percent in fiscal 2004. - TURBOTAX revenue of $5.2 million was down 15 percent from first-quarter 2003, as expected. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual TurboTax revenue growth of 10 percent to 20 percent in fiscal 2004. - Revenue from Intuit's PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTING SOLUTIONS (PAS) business increased 7 percent over the year-ago quarter to $6.9 million. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual PAS revenue growth of 7 percent to 12 percent. - Intuit's VERTICAL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS unit had organic year-over-year revenue growth of 40 percent to $26.3 million. Intuit reaffirmed guidance for annual Verticals revenue growth of 15 percent to 25 percent in fiscal 2004. - Revenue from Other Businesses, which includes Quicken and Canada, was $38.2 million, down 9 percent from the year-ago quarter, as expected. FORWARD-LOOKING GUIDANCE FOR SECOND-QUARTER 2004 Intuit provided its guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2004, which will end Jan. 31, 2004. Although financial analysts have developed their own estimates for Intuit's second-quarter performance, Intuit had not previously issued guidance for the quarter. Second-quarter 2004 guidance is: - Revenue of $615 million to $640 million, or year-over-year growth of 10 percent to 15 percent.
- Pro forma operating income of $208 million to $218 million, or year-over-year growth of 13 percent to 18 percent, and GAAP operating income of $198 million to $208 million. - Pro forma diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.71, or year-over-year growth of 8 percent to 16 percent, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.63 to $0.68. FORWARD-LOOKING GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2004 Intuit reaffirmed its pro forma guidance for fiscal 2004, which ends July 31, 2004. Intuit has recalculated its GAAP operating income and EPS guidance to reflect the additional amortization of intangibles associated with its October 2003 acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions: - Revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, or year-over-year organic growth of approximately 12 percent to 18 percent. - Pro forma operating income of $480 million to $510 million, or growth of approximately 20 percent to 28 percent over fiscal 2003. On a GAAP basis, operating income is expected to be $443 million to $473 million, or growth of approximately 29 percent to 38 percent over fiscal 2003. - Pro forma diluted earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.67, or growth of approximately 13 percent to 20 percent over fiscal 2003. Intuit expects that lower growth in Interest and Other Income will slow the growth in EPS versus the growth in operating income. On a GAAP basis, diluted EPS is expected to be $1.46 to $1.56, down approximately 4 percent to 10 percent from fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 GAAP EPS included net income and gains from discontinued operations of nearly $80 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, which is not anticipated to recur in fiscal 2004. ABOUT PRO FORMA, OR NON-GAAP, FINANCIAL MEASURES Intuit computes its pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.

CAUTIONS ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This press release contains forward-looking statements about future financial results and other events that have not yet occurred, including guidance about our expected results for fiscal 2004. Statements about Intuit's "guidance", statements including words such as "expect," "anticipate" or "believe," and statements in the future tense, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our expressed expectations because of risks and uncertainties about the future. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ are discussed below. More details about these and other risks are included in our SEC filings and at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors/consideration.html. We do not intend to undertake any duty to update the information in this press release if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be inaccurate. - We face increasingly intense competitive pressures in all of our businesses, which can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position. - If we do not continue to develop new products and services in a timely manner, our future financial results will suffer. - Expanding our product and service offerings creates risk due to the increasing complexity and decreasing predictability of our revenue streams. - We are continuing to implement new information systems to enable us to execute on our growth strategy, and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with our business and operations. - Any significant failure in our technology systems could harm our operations and financial performance. - Integrating acquired businesses presents several challenges and we may not fully realize the intended benefits of our acquisitions if we do not successfully integrate them with our operations. - Given the nature of the products and services that we offer, our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal. - It is too soon to provide assurances that we will be able to generate substantial and sustained revenue growth from new products and services in our QuickBooks, Small Business Products and Services and Vertical Business Management solutions segments. - The product activation technology that we introduced into certain TurboTax desktop products last year could have an adverse impact on this year's results for our Consumer Tax business.
- Significant delays or problems in developing our Consumer Tax and Professional Tax products would result in lost revenue and customers. - If we fail to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our electronic tax offerings, we could lose revenue and customers.

INTUIT COMPUTES PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES USING THE SAME CONSISTENT METHOD FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND YEAR TO YEAR. SEE NOTES [A] THROUGH [G] FOR DETAILS.
NOTES TO TABLES A1 AND B: [A] Table B reconciles the differences between the pro forma or non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and the GAAP condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2002 and 2003. Pro forma operating income (loss) excludes certain cost and expense line items that are in the GAAP statement of operations. For example, for the line item "acquisition-related charges," the number in the GAAP column is subtracted out of the pro forma column in calculating pro forma operating income or loss. Eliminating cost or expense items improves pro forma results compared to GAAP results. Pro forma net income (loss) starts with pro forma operating income or loss and then excludes certain non-operating gains and losses that are in the GAAP statement of operations. For example, for the line item "gains on marketable securities and other investments, net" the number in the GAAP column is taken out of the pro forma column in calculating pro forma net income or loss. Eliminating loss line items improves pro forma results compared to GAAP results. Eliminating gain line items decreases pro forma results compared to GAAP results. [B] We amortize the value of software and other technology assets that we receive in connection with certain acquisitions over their estimated useful lives. [C] In connection with certain acquisitions we determine the value of in-process projects under development for which technological feasibility has not been established. The value of each project is recorded as a charge for purchased research and development at the time of the acquisition. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we recorded a charge for purchased research and development of $7.8 million in connection with our acquisition of Blue Ocean Software, Inc. [D] Acquisition-related charges include amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation related to acquisitions as well as impairment charges. For the three months ended October 31, 2002 and 2003, amortization of purchased intangible assets and deferred compensation was $9.5 million and $6.0 million and there were no impairment charges. [E] Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by non-deductible merger and divestiture related charges. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the net effect of the benefit received from tax-exempt interest income and various tax credits offset by state taxes. [F] On July 31, 2002, we sold our Quicken Loans mortgage business to Rock Acquisition Corporation and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, we sold our residual minority equity interest in Rock and recorded a gain of $5.6 million. [G] On February 7, 2003, we sold our wholly owned Japanese subsidiary, Intuit KK, and accounted for the sale as discontinued operations. Accordingly, we have segregated the operating results of Intuit KK from continuing operations on our statement of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net income from Intuit KK discontinued operations for the three months ended October 31, 2002 was net of income tax expense of $0.2 million.
TABLE C INTUIT INC. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands) (Unaudited) Note: Cash and short-term investments declined during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 due to our use of cash for normal seasonal operating needs, for our stock repurchase programs and for the acquisition of Innovative Merchant Solutions.

THE RECONCILIATIONS OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP IN THIS TABLE D1 INCLUDE ALL INFORMATION REASONABLY AVAILABLE TO INTUIT AT THE DATE OF THIS PRESS RELEASE. THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS TABLE ARE THOSE THAT MANAGEMENT CAN PREDICT. INTUIT'S PRO FORMA FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES. EVENTS THAT COULD CAUSE THE RECONCILIATION TO CHANGE INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES OF BUSINESSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

Net of related income tax expense, these pro forma adjustments resulted in a $0.01 per diluted share adjustment for the three months ended January 31, 2003. [c] Reflects adjustments for amortization of purchased software of $13.8 million, charges for purchased research and development of $8.9 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $33.9 million, resulting in a 3.4% adjustment to operating margin for the twelve months ended July 31, 2003. [d] Reflects the adjustments in item [c] and adjustments for net gains on marketable securities of $10.9 million and net income from discontinued operations of $79.8 million. Net of related income tax expense, these pro forma adjustments resulted in a $0.24 per diluted share adjustment for the twelve months ended July 31, 2003. [e] Reflects adjustments for amortization of purchased software of $7.0 million, charges for purchased research and development of $1.3 million and amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets of $150.2 million, resulting in a 16.1% adjustment to operating margin for the twelve months ended July 31, 2000. [f] Reflects the adjustments in item [e] and adjustments for net gains on marketable securities of $481.1 million and net income from discontinued operations of $20.0 million.

99.01 Press release issued on February 18, 2004.
ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On February 18, 2004, Intuit Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended January 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.01.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, and refers to them as "pro forma." Intuit computes its pro forma financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Intuit's pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies.
     Intuit's management believes that these pro forma measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Pro forma financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the historical and forward-looking pro forma financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables attached to the press release filed as an exhibit to this Report.
     The information in this Report and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.

About pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures
Intuit computes its pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. Statements about Intuit's "guidance," statements including words such as "expect," "anticipate" or "believe," and statements in the future tense, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following:

Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable securities.

99.01 Intuit Inc.'s Business Conduct Guide, as amended through May 4, 2004.
ITEM 10. AMENDMENTS TO THE REGISTRANT'S CODE OF ETHICS.
     Intuit's Business Conduct Guide applies to all employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer/controller, and persons performing similar functions (collectively, "Senior Executive and Financial Officers"). Intuit revised Section 5 of its Business Conduct Guide, which describes specific obligations of its Senior Executive and Financial Officers. The revised section (now Section 6) clarifies that the Business Conduct Guide meets all of the requirements for a Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and Financial Officers (as defined in S-K Item 406(b)), and that Intuit therefore has not established any additional standards of conduct for its Senior Executive and Financial Officers.

EXHIBIT 99.01
LIVING OUR OPERATING VALUES
Intuit's first operating value is "Integrity Without Compromise." As stated in our Vision, Mission and Operating Values: "In all we do, we maintain the highest standards, never approaching what could be considered questionable behavior. On this we never compromise."
You are expected to carry out your work in accordance with these standards of conduct   along with every other employee of Intuit or any of its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Intuit). You should be aware that these standards are greater than those that may be required by law. In addition, your Business Unit (BU) or Functional Group (FG) may impose stricter guidelines depending on business needs. For non-US employees, the Business Conduct Guide generally applies to you, but any specific provisions that are inconsistent with your local laws and policies will not apply to you.
These guidelines do not, and cannot, cover every situation. We encourage you to seek guidance from your supervisor, the Vice President in your BU or FG, or the General Counsel.
1. AVOIDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
You are generally free to engage in personal business and financial transactions and other activities outside of Intuit. However, you may not participate in any activity in which your personal interests conflict with those of Intuit.
A conflict of interest occurs whenever you permit the prospect of direct or indirect personal gain to improperly influence your judgment or actions and to conflict with your responsibilities to Intuit. You should avoid situations in which your loyalties may be divided between Intuit's interests and your personal interests. It's your responsibility to bring any potential conflict of interest to your supervisor's attention so that he or she may provide appropriate guidance, which may include asking that you end the activity that raises a conflict of interest issue.

You are prohibited from accepting simultaneous employment as an employee, independent contractor, consultant with, or member of the board of directors of, an outside business concern (particularly, an Intuit customer, partner, distributor, supplier), if such affiliation could give rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest. Possible examples include serving as a director or an officer of a firm that sells to or purchases from Intuit, or working for a supplier. You are also prohibited from taking part in any activity that enhances or supports a competitor's position, including accepting simultaneous employment with a competitor. Any compensation, including equity compensation, you receive for serving with an outside business concern should be of an amount consistent with your responsibilities.
B. Gifts and Entertainment
Neither you nor any member of your immediate family may give or accept any gift which might indicate an intent to improperly influence the normal business relationship between Intuit and any supplier, customer, partner, distributor or other third party. Permissible gifts are given openly, directly, come with no strings attached, and are of appropriate value. You should never accept a gift that is given to create a sense of obligation on your part with the intention of changing your behavior. You are prohibited from accepting any gift from an Intuit competitor. For the purpose of this policy, "gift" is defined as any object or service of value, including vacations, tickets to sporting events, etc.
As a general guide, a gift with a value of over US$250 may be improper. However, repeated gifts with a value under US$250 also may be considered improper. For example, an offer from a supplier to treat you to an expensive dinner every month might indicate intent to improperly influence the business relationship, and thus accepting the offer could violate this
 
policy. We expect you to use good judgment and seek guidance from your supervisor or by contacting the General Counsel if you have any questions about this provision.
Neither you nor any member of your immediate family may accept any personal discount from any Intuit supplier, customer or competitor, unless the same discount is available to all Intuit employees or is publicly available.
For information regarding gifts, gratuities, or entertainment to employees of the US Government, state and local governments, or foreign government entities, see the Intuit Corporate Affairs website.
C. Investments in Other Businesses
Neither you nor any member of your immediate family may hold a financial interest in an outside business concern (e.g., with any of Intuit's suppliers, partners, distributors or competitors) that might give rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest. Many factors should be considered in determining whether a conflict of interest exists, including the size and nature of the investment; your ability to influence Intuit decisions that could affect the other company; your access to confidential information of Intuit or of the other company; and the nature of the relationship between Intuit and the other business. For example, you may hold a financial interest in a mutual fund that invests in an Intuit competitor, where you have no influence or control over the fund's investment decisions. However, you may not hold a substantial equity interest in one of our suppliers.
D. Conducting Business With Family Members
As a general rule, you should avoid conducting Intuit business with a family member or with a business in which a family member is associated in any significant role. You must disclose to your supervisor all situations in which you or your Intuit working group is conducting business with a member of your family. Once you disclose the arrangement, the Vice President of your BU/FG will determine whether the relationship may proceed. If the relationship does proceed, you will not be permitted to make Intuit decisions about retaining, supervising or evaluating the services provided to Intuit.
E. Corporate Opportunities
You should not take for yourself a business opportunity in which Intuit has an interest. A corporate opportunity will typically be a business opportunity in which Intuit is already interested or which is closely related to Intuit's current business or its anticipated future plans. Possible examples include: an officer's purchase of an equity interest in a company that he/she knows Intuit may be interested in acquiring; or an employee's leasing a facility that Intuit has considered occupying. If you believe you may be pursuing such an opportunity, you must disclose the opportunity to the Vice President in your BU/FG. Once you've disclosed the potential arrangement, the Vice President will determine whether the relationship may proceed.
2. CONDUCTING BUSINESS WITH INTEGRITY
We've designed these guidelines to help you conduct Intuit's business with integrity and in compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. Although the spirit of these laws is straightforward, their application to particular situations can be complex. If you have a question concerning any of this information, please contact your supervisor or the BU/FG attorney who is responsible for your group.
A. Antitrust Laws
Our policy is to comply with all US federal, state and local antitrust laws, as well as all applicable foreign antitrust laws. Antitrust laws, also known as "anti-monopoly", "competition" or "consumer protection" laws, are intended to preserve competition by prohibiting actions that could unreasonably restrain the functioning of a free marketplace.
These laws often regulate Intuit's relationships with its distributors and dealers, including pricing practices, discounting, credit terms, promotional allowances, exclusive dealerships or distributorships, restrictions on carrying competing products, termination and many other practices.
They also govern relationships between Intuit and its competitors. As a general rule, contacts with competitors should be limited and should always avoid subjects such as prices or other terms and conditions of sale, customers and suppliers.
 
Participating with competitors in a trade association is generally acceptable when the association has been properly established, has a legitimate purpose, and has limited its activities to that purpose.
B. External Communications
Intuit's reputation for integrity is an important asset and the result of honesty with the general public, our stockholders and our customers. Intuit is committed to the full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with, or submit to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public communications that we make. In addition, we must always be truthful in our promotional efforts and other public announcements. You must not use misrepresentations in any external communication, including, regulatory filings, advertisements, and promotional or public announcements.
C. Intuit's Confidential Information
Intuit's confidential and proprietary information is our most valuable asset and includes product architectures, source codes, and programming techniques; product plans and road maps; names and lists of customers, dealers, and employees; and financial information. This information is Intuit property and is protected by copyright, trade secret laws, and, sometimes, by patents. Every employee has the responsibility to safeguard it and to never disclose it, intentionally or inadvertently.
When you joined Intuit, you signed an Employee Invention Assignment and Confidentiality Agreement to protect and hold confidential Intuit's proprietary information. This Agreement remains in effect for as long as you work for Intuit and even after you leave Intuit. Under this agreement, you may not disclose Intuit's confidential information to anyone or use it to benefit anyone other than Intuit. Any permitted disclosure of confidential information to a third party requires a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between Intuit and the third party, completed in accordance with Intuit's procedures.
From time to time, you may have access to information about Intuit's business that has not been publicly disclosed. Material, nonpublic information about Intuit's business is called "inside" information. It can be financial information, product launch dates, or any other information that could affect the price of Intuit's stock. Trading stock on the basis of inside information is illegal. For information regarding trading limitations and inside information, see Intuit's Insider Trading Policy.
D. Third-Party Proprietary Information/Intellectual Property
Intuit respects the intellectual property of third parties. You may be a former employee of another company and possess trade secrets of that company. You must not reveal any information to Intuit that might reasonably be considered a trade secret of a former employer.
Some of the software used at Intuit was created and copyrighted by other companies and may be subject to nondisclosure restrictions. Such software is usually governed by a license agreement. It is Intuit's policy to comply with license agreements that govern the use of software. Reproducing software without authorization may violate these agreements, and is likely to violate the US Copyright Act, and the copyright laws of other countries. You shouldn't make copies, resell or transfer software created by another company unless it is authorized under the applicable software license agreement.
You may, under a written agreement (typically a Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement completed in accordance with Intuit's procedures) become familiar with a supplier's proprietary designs, processes, or techniques, or gain other information that the supplier has designated as proprietary or as trade secrets under the agreement. You must take care to respect the proprietary nature of this information and not use it without authorization or reveal it to the supplier's competitors.
You must also comply with rules governing internal distribution of copyrighted articles, content and subscription materials so that Intuit does not violate an author's or publisher's rights to control duplication or distribution. To learn about Intuit's basic guidelines for referencing, distributing or quoting from copyrighted materials, see http://home.intuit.com/legal/reference/IP/permissions_licensing.shtml.
E. Proper Use of Company Funds, Property and Computing Resources
You are personally accountable for any form of company funds, such as credit cards, tickets, cash and checks that you may have. If you use company funds, you must ensure that the company has received proper value in return. Intuit trusts its
 
employees with company property. Using this property in a way that conflicts Intuit's interests, or in any manner that may reasonably be considered offensive or disruptive to another employee, is strictly prohibited. Please also see Intuit's Computer/Internet/Email policy, which discusses proper use of our electronic commerce, electronic mail, and other Internet-related systems.
F. Accurate Books, Records and Accounts
All Intuit payments and other transactions must be properly authorized by management and be accurately and completely recorded on Intuit books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and established corporate accounting policies. You must not create any false, incomplete or misleading entry or record. No undisclosed or unrecorded corporate funds shall be established for any purpose, nor should Intuit funds be placed in any personal or non-corporate account. All corporate assets must be properly protected and asset records regularly compared with actual assets; proper and prompt action must be taken to reconcile any variances.
G. Bribery/Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
No officer, employee, agent or stockholder acting on behalf of Intuit may pay or accept bribes of any type. A bribe is defined as a payment made to influence an act or someone's decision, or inducing such person to use his influence. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act places restrictions on such bribes, which carry civil and criminal liability for both Intuit and individual officers, employees, agents and stockholders acting on behalf of Intuit. Similar laws may apply in other countries.
With the exception of certain regulatory fees set by the government, all offers, payments, promises to pay, authorization to pay any money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization to give anything of value to any foreign official, political party or official thereof from either Intuit or private funds in furtherance of Intuit business are strictly prohibited.
In light of the restrictive nature of these prohibitions, you may not make payments to any foreign government officials or employees without obtaining guidance from the General Counsel.
H. Political Contributions/Gifts
Business contributions to political campaigns are strictly regulated by U.S. federal, state and local law. Accordingly, all political contributions with Intuit funds are coordinated and approved by Intuit Corporate Affairs. You may not, without the approval of Intuit Corporate Affairs, use any Intuit funds for political contributions of any kind to any political candidate or holder of any national, state or local government office. You may make personal contributions, but you may not represent that you're making any such contribution on Intuit's behalf. Similar restrictions on political contributions may apply in other countries. Please contact Intuit Corporate Affairs if you have any specific questions.
I. Entertaining or Doing Business with the United States and Foreign Governments
Giving anything of value to a government employee is strictly regulated and in many cases prohibited by law. Both you and Intuit must also comply with US federal, state and local laws, as well as foreign government laws governing the acceptance of business courtesies. You should consult with Intuit Corporate Affairs before providing or paying for any meals, refreshments, travel or lodging expenses, or giving anything of value to any US federal, state or local government employees, or to government employees of other countries.
3. Workplace Conduct
Intuit's values include ethical actions, honesty, respect for others and teamwork. Intuit policies prohibit discrimination and harassment of any kind and include our Rules of Conduct, Non-Harassment Policy, Workplace Violence Policy and Equal Opportunity Employment Plan. Other policies may apply in non-US locations. These policies are intended to protect our employees, and provide a safe, harassment-free environment. Intuit strictly prohibits harassment or discrimination of any kind, including harassment on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, gender, age, mental or physical disability, medical condition, national origin, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected under applicable laws.
 
4. Prompt Reporting of Possible Business Conduct Guide Violations; Protection Against Retaliation
If you know of or suspect any conduct that you believe is inconsistent with the Business Conduct Guide (including complaints or concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters), you are urged to report it. You may report to your supervisor, to the Vice President of your BU/FG, or through Intuit's Ethical Conduct Hotline, which offers the following reporting methods:
Intuit will promptly investigate all reports of alleged non-compliance with the Business Conduct Guide and determine an appropriate course of action. Any employee who reports an actual or potential violation of the Business Conduct Guide will be protected from retaliation (such as termination, demotion, threats or harassment) by Intuit or any Intuit employee, so long as the report is made in good faith, and is based on information the employee reasonably believes is truthful.
5. Disciplinary Actions  Accountability for Adherence to Business Conduct Guide
The matters covered in this Business Conduct Guide are of the utmost importance to Intuit, its stockholders, and its business partners, and are essential to Intuit's ability to conduct its business in accordance with our stated values. We expect all of our employees to adhere to these rules in carrying out their duties for Intuit and such adherence is a condition of employment with Intuit.
Intuit will take appropriate action against any employee whose actions are found to violate the Business Conduct Guide. Disciplinary actions may include the immediate termination of employment. Where Intuit has suffered a loss, it will pursue its remedies against the individuals or entities responsible. Where laws have been violated, Intuit will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities. Employees performing services in the United States or other countries governed by at will employment rules, should be aware that this Business Conduct Guide does not alter an employee's at-will relationship with Intuit.
6. Standards of Conduct for Senior Executive and Financial Officers
This Business Conduct Guide applies to all employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer/controller, and persons performing similar functions ("Senior Executive and Financial Officers"). Under U.S. law, our Senior Executive and Financial Officers must be subject to written standards of conduct that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
We believe our Business Conduct Guide satisfies all of the requirements for written standards of conduct applicable to our Senior Executive and Financial Officers. Accordingly, Intuit has not established any additional standards of conduct for those individuals.
7. Administration of Business Conduct Guide
The Business Conduct Guide is administered by Intuit's Ethics Committee, whose members are currently the Chief Financial Officer, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources, and the General Counsel. The Ethics Committee is authorized to make changes to the Business Conduct from time to time. Intuit will notify employees of any significant changes.
 
The Ethics Committee will generally make final determinations on how to resolve any issues under the Business Conduct Guide that are appropriately escalated to the Ethics Committee. However, any issues under the Business Conduct Guide relating to executive officers of Intuit must be submitted to Intuit's Board of Directors for consideration. Any activities that are conducted with Board approval shall be deemed to comply with the Business Conduct Guide, and shall not be considered a waiver of the Business Conduct Guide.

99.01 Press release issued on May 19, 2004.
ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On May 19, 2004, Intuit Inc. announced its financial results for the quarter ended April 30, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached to this Report as Exhibit 99.01.
     The attached press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, and refers to them as "pro forma." Intuit computes its pro forma financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Intuit's pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of goodwill and intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and pro forma diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies.
     Intuit's management believes that these pro forma measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Pro forma financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the historical and forward-looking pro forma financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables attached to the press release filed as an exhibit to this Report.
     The information in this Report and the exhibit attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing.

About pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures
     Intuit's management believes that the pro forma financial measures it uses provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes pro forma financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
     This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. All of the statements under the headings "Fourth-Quarter Fiscal 2004 Guidance," "Fiscal 2004 Guidance," and "Fiscal 2005 Guidance" are forward-looking statements. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following:
 
More details about these and other risks are included in our Forms 10-Q, 2003 Form 10-K, and other SEC filings and at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors. We do not undertake any duty to update the information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Aug. 18, 2004  Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2004, which ended July 31, 2004.
      "Intuit again delivered solid growth for the quarter and year," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "TurboTax and Small Business Products and Services  our two largest segments  had particularly strong years. Looking ahead, we expect our portfolio to deliver steady revenue and strong profit growth."

Fourth-Quarter 2004 Highlights
Intuit to Sell Public Sector Solutions Business
     Intuit said it has decided to sell its public sector business management solutions business. "Intuit is very rigorous about managing our portfolio so that we're always focused on the right growth opportunities," said Bennett. "Over the past several years, we've made a number of changes to our portfolio  acquiring or developing businesses that fit our growth criteria and exiting those that don't. A combination of industry dynamics, our competitive position and our other opportunities make this the right decision for Intuit. We like our other verticals businesses and are pleased with the solid revenue and profit growth they're delivering."
 
     Intuit Public Sector Solutions (IPSS) contributed $13 million in revenue in fiscal 2004. Without the business, Intuit's verticals portfolio had 17 percent revenue growth in fiscal 2004.
     While IPSS performance is included in the results Intuit reported today and will be included in its upcoming Form 10-K, it will be treated as a discontinued business in future financial filings, as required. As a result, Intuit did not include past or future results from the IPSS business when it developed pro forma first-quarter and fiscal year 2005 guidance, but have included it in GAAP EPS guidance.
Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2005
     Intuit provided more detail on its financial guidance for fiscal 2005, which will end July 31, 2005:

About pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures
Intuit's management believes that the pro forma financial measures it uses provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes pro forma financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Intuit computes its pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are
 
most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. Mr. Bennett's statement regarding our expectations for delivering steady revenue and strong profit growth and all of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2005," and "Forward-Looking Guidance for First Quarter Fiscal 2005" are forward-looking statements. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft in our software businesses and governmental encroachment in our tax businesses, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; we are implementing new information systems and problems with the design or implementation of these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; revenue growth for some of our products is slowing and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2003 and in subsequent Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors. We do not undertake any duty to update the information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.

     This Indemnity Agreement (this ""), dated as of July 10, 2002 (""), is made by and between Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation (the ""), and Lorrie M. Norrington, an individual who is a director and/or officer of the Company and/or of a subsidiary of the Company (the "").
Agreement
Effective Date
Company
Indemnitee
     A. The Company is aware that competent and experienced persons are increasingly reluctant to serve as directors or officers of corporations unless they are protected by comprehensive liability insurance and/or indemnification, due to their increased exposure to litigation costs and risks resulting from their service to such corporations, and due to the fact that this exposure frequently bears no reasonable relationship to the compensation of such directors and officers.
     B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "") has determined that uncertainties relating to the availability, expense and the scope of protection afforded by liability insurance and uncertainties regarding the availability and scope of indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons to serve as directors and officers, and that this situation is detrimental to the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Board
     C. Based on the experience of its members, the Board has concluded that, to retain and attract talented and experienced individuals to serve as officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries, and to encourage such individuals to make the business decisions and take the business risks necessary for the success of the Company and its subsidiaries, it is reasonable, prudent and necessary for the Company to contractually obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, its officers and directors and certain officers and directors of its subsidiaries, and to assume for itself maximum liability for expenses and damages in connection with claims against such officers and directors in connection with their service to the Company and its subsidiaries (including service in such capacities during time periods occurring prior to the date this Agreement is executed).
     D. Section 145 ("") of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, under which the Company is organized (the ""), empowers the Company to indemnify by agreement its officers, directors, employees and agents, and persons who serve, at the request of the Company, as directors, officers, employees or agents of other corporations or enterprises, and expressly provides that the indemnification provided by the Law is not exclusive.
Section 145
Law
     E. The Company has requested the Indemnitee to serve or continue to serve as a director or officer of the Company and/or one or more of the subsidiaries of the Company, and desires that the Indemnitee do so free from undue concern for claims for damages arising out of or related to such services to the Company and/or subsidiaries of the Company that may impede the free exercise of the Indemnitee's business judgment on behalf of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries.
 
     F. The Indemnitee is willing to serve and to continue to serve the Company on the condition that the Indemnitee is indemnified and afforded rights to the advancement of expenses as provided in this Agreement.
     , in consideration of the covenants contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

If the Indemnitee is a person who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the Company) by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was an agent of the Company, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as an agent of the Company, then, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement and the exceptions set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any and all expenses and liabilities of any type whatsoever (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) actually and

reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of, or being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal) or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or to participate in, such proceeding if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.
          (b) . If the Indemnitee was or is a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any proceeding by or in the right of the Company to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was an agent of the Company, or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in the Indemnitee's capacity as an agent of the Company, then, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of this Agreement and the exceptions set forth in Section 9 of this Agreement, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against any amounts paid in settlement of any such proceeding and all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of, or being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or to participate in, such proceeding if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company; that no indemnification under this subsection 4(b) shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which the Indemnitee shall have been finally adjudged to be liable to the Company by a court of competent jurisdiction, unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, the Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such amounts which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Actions by or in Right of the Company
except
          (c) . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the Indemnitee was or is, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was an agent of the Company, a witness or other non-party participant in any proceeding to which the Indemnitee is not made a party then the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitee's behalf solely in connection with the Indemnitee's being a witness or other non-party participant in such proceeding (including on appeal), and in preparing to be a witness or such other non-party participant in such proceeding without the need for any determination with respect to the Indemnitee's conduct pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement.
Witness Expenses in Certain Proceedings
          (d) . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to make any separate payments to the Indemnitee for expenses or liabilities of any type whatsoever (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) to the extent that D&O Insurance covers such expenses or liabilities and the carrier of the D&O Insurance makes payment for such expenses and/or liabilities directly to the Indemnitee. To the extent that any payment payable by the carrier of the D&O Insurance in respect of such expenses or liabilities has previously been paid or advanced to the Indemnitee by the Company, the parties agree that the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnitee to receive such payments from the D&O Insurance carrier and that the Indemnitee will take all actions reasonably necessary to

turn over or otherwise cause the Company to receive such payment from the D&O Insurance carrier.

5. 
Partial Indemnification and Contribution
          (a) . If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of any expenses or liabilities of any type whatsoever (including, but not limited to, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) incurred by The Indemnitee in the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of, or being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or to participate in, a proceeding but the Indemnitee is not entitled, however, to indemnification for the total amount thereof, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for such total amount except as to the portion thereof to which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.
Partial Indemnification
          (b) . If the Indemnitee is not entitled to the indemnification provided in Section 4 for any reason other than the statutory limitations set forth in the Law or the provisions of Section 9, then in respect of any threatened, pending or completed proceeding in which the Company is jointly liable with the Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such proceeding), the Company shall contribute to the amount of expenses, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by the Indemnitee in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect (i) the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Indemnitee on the other hand from the transaction from which such proceeding arose and (ii) the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnitee on the other hand in connection with the events which resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties or settlement amounts, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnitee on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent the circumstances resulting in such expenses, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes, penalties or settlement amounts. The Company agrees that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(b) were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the foregoing equitable considerations.

Mandatory Advancement of Expenses
          (a) . Subject to the exceptions in Section 9 below, the Company shall advance all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense, settlement or appeal of, or the Indemnitee's being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, to be a witness in or to participate in, any proceeding to which the Indemnitee is a party or witness or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or witness or other participant in, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was an agent of the Company or by reason of anything done or not done by the Indemnitee in any such capacity. The Indemnitee hereby undertakes to promptly repay such amounts advanced to the Indemnitee to the Company only if, and to the extent that, it shall ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company
Advancement

under the provisions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, the Law or otherwise with respect to the proceeding in respect of which such amounts were advanced. The advances to be made hereunder shall be paid by the Company to the Indemnitee within twenty (20) days following delivery of a written request therefor by the Indemnitee to the Company. Such request shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee (such as, for example, by submission of invoices from third parties for such expenses).
          (b) . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6(a), and subject to the provisions of Section 6(c), unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 8, no advance of expenses shall be made by the Company if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board by the vote of a majority of the Disinterested Directors (or, if there are no Disinterested Directors, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion) that the facts known to the party making such determination at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that, (i) with respect to the proceeding in respect of which the Indemnitee has requested an advance of expenses from the Company, the Indemnitee acted in bad faith or in a manner that the Indemnitee did not believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders or (ii) that the expenses submitted for advancement have been fraudulently submitted by the Indemnitee or were submitted in bad faith by the Indemnitee.
Exception
          (c) . Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 6(b), if, at any time after the occurrence of the activities or omissions that are the primary focus of the proceeding with respect to which an advance of expenses is sought by the Indemnitee, the Company has undergone a Change of Control, then only Independent Counsel selected by the Indemnitee (and not a majority of the Disinterested Directors) may make the determination described in Section 6(b).
Effect of Change of Control

7. 
Notice; Assumption of Defense
          (a) . Promptly after receipt by the Indemnitee of notice of the commencement of or the threat of commencement of any proceeding, the Indemnitee shall, if the Indemnitee believes that indemnification with respect to such proceeding may be sought from the Company under this Agreement, notify the Company of the commencement or threat of commencement thereof.
Notice of Proceeding
          (b) . If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of the commencement of a proceeding pursuant to Section 7(a), the Company has D&O Insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurer or insurers providing such D&O Insurance in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective D&O Insurance policies. The Company shall thereafter take all necessary or desirable action to cause such insurers to pay, on behalf of the Indemnitee, all amounts payable by such insurers as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of such D&O Insurance policies.
Notice to D&O Insurance Carrier
          (c) . In the event the Company shall be obligated to advance the expenses for any proceeding against the Indemnitee, the Company, if appropriate, shall be entitled to assume the defense of such proceeding, with counsel approved
Assumption of Defense by Company

by the Indemnitee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), upon the Company's delivery to the Indemnitee of written notice of the Company's election to do so. After delivery of such notice, approval of such counsel by the Indemnitee and the retention of such counsel by the Company, the Company will not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any fees of counsel subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to the same proceeding, : (i) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in any such proceeding at the Indemnitee's expense; (ii) the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with any such proceeding at the expense of the Company, if such counsel serves only in a review, observer, advice and counseling capacity and does not otherwise materially control or participate in the defense of such proceeding; and (iii) if (A) the employment of counsel by the Indemnitee has been previously authorized by the Company, (B) the Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Company and the Indemnitee in the conduct of any such defense or (C) the Company shall not, in fact, have employed counsel to assume the defense of such proceeding, then the fees and expenses (of the types described in the definition of expenses in Section 1(e) of this Agreement) of the Indemnitee's counsel shall be at the expense of the Company. The Company shall not be required to obtain the consent of the Indemnitee to the settlement of any proceeding as to which the Company has assumed the defense of the Indemnitee if the Company assumes full and sole responsibility and liability for such settlement and the settlement grants the Indemnitee a complete and unqualified release in respect of the potential liability arising from such proceeding.

Determination of Right to Indemnification
          (a) . To the extent the Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any proceeding referred to in Section 4(a) or 4(b) of this Agreement or in the defense of any claim, issue or matter described therein, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation, defense or appeal of such proceeding or the Indemnitee's being a witness or other participant in such proceeding.
Indemnitee Successful on Merits
          (b) . In the event that Section 8(a) is inapplicable, the Company shall nonetheless indemnify the Indemnitee as provided in Section 4(a) or 4(b), as applicable, unless the Company shall claim and prove by clear and convincing evidence to a forum listed in Section 8(d) below that (i) the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct required to entitle the Indemnitee to such indemnification under Section 4(a) or 4(b), as applicable, or (ii) the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under the provisions of Section 9.
Indemnitee Not Successful on Merits
          (c) . In the event that the provisions of Section 4(c) apply because the Indemnitee was not a party to the proceeding, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Indemnitee or on the Indemnitee's behalf in connection with being a witness or other non-party participant in such proceeding (including on appeal), and in preparing to be a witness or such other non-party participant in such proceeding.

          (d) . In the event that the Company claims that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 4(a) or 4(b) of this Agreement, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to select the forum in which the validity of the Company's claim that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification shall be heard from among the following:
Selection of Forum to Determine Entitlement to Indemnification
               (1) A majority of the members of the Board who are Disinterested Directors with respect to the proceeding for which indemnification is being sought by the Indemnitee;
               (2) The stockholders of the Company;
               (3) Independent Counsel selected by the Indemnitee, and reasonably approved by the Board, which Independent Counsel shall make such determination in a written opinion; or
               (4) A panel of three arbitrators, one of whom is selected by the Company, another of whom is selected by the Indemnitee and the last of whom is selected by the first two arbitrators so selected, who will conduct the determination in Mountain View, California pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
          (e) . As soon as practicable, and in no event later than thirty (30) days after written notice of the Indemnitee's choice of forum pursuant to Section 8(d), the Company shall, at its own expense, submit to the selected, in such manner as the Indemnitee or the Indemnitee's counsel may reasonably request, its claim under Section 8(b) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification and the Company shall act in the utmost good faith to assure the Indemnitee a complete opportunity to defend against such claim. The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the forum making such determination with respect to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such forum upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.
Procedure for Determination
          (f) . If the forum listed in Section 8(d) selected by the Indemnitee determines that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific proceeding, then such determination shall be final and binding on the Company, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee to the extent so determined by such forum and payment of such indemnification shall be made by the Company within thirty (30) days after such determination. If the forum listed in Section 8(d) selected by the Indemnitee determines that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification with respect to a specific proceeding, then the Indemnitee shall have the right to apply to the Court of Chancery of Delaware, the court in which that proceeding is or was pending or any other court of competent jurisdiction, for the purpose of appealing such determination and obtaining an adjudication by such court of the Indemnitee's entitlement to such indemnification pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such proceeding, such right is exercised by the Indemnitee within sixty (60) days after the final decision of such forum is rendered. The Company shall not oppose the Indemnitee's
Effect of Determination
provided
that

right to seek any such adjudication, and any such judicial adjudication shall be conducted in all respects as a trial on the merits, such that any determination made by any forum selected pursuant to Section 8(d) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder shall not be binding on any such court and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of any such determination by such forum. If the forum selected by the Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8(d) to determine whether the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within 120 days after the date on which the Company is required by Section 8(e) to submit to such forum its claim that the Indemnitee is not entitled to such indemnification, then the Indemnitee shall be entitled to apply to the Court of Chancery of Delaware to have the Indemnitee's request for indemnification adjudicated by such Court in lieu of having the determination made by such forum. The Company shall not oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication.
de
novo
          (g) . For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet any particular standard of conduct or have any particular belief or that a court has determined that indemnification is not permitted by this Agreement or applicable law. In addition, neither the failure of any forum selected pursuant to Section 8(d) above to have made a determination as to whether the Indemnitee has met any particular standard of conduct or had any particular belief, nor an actual determination by any such selected forum that the Indemnitee has not met such standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the Indemnitee's claim for indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met any particular standard of conduct or did not have any particular belief. In connection with any determination by any selected forum or otherwise as to whether the Indemnitee is entitled to be indemnified hereunder, the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that the Indemnitee is not so entitled.
No Presumption
          (h) . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall indemnify the Indemnitee against all expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any hearing or proceeding under this Section 8 (including any adjudication before any court contemplated by the foregoing provisions of this Section 8) involving the Indemnitee and against all expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any other proceeding between the Company and the Indemnitee involving the interpretation or enforcement of the rights of the Indemnitee under this Agreement unless a court of competent jurisdiction finds that each of the material claims and/or defenses of the Indemnitee in any such proceeding was frivolous or not made in good faith.
Certain Expenses
     . Any other provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall not be obligated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement:
9. 
Exceptions
          (a) . To indemnify or advance expenses to the Indemnitee with respect to proceedings or claims initiated or brought voluntarily by the Indemnitee and not by way of defense, except with respect to proceedings specifically authorized by the Board or brought to establish or enforce a right to indemnification and/or advancement of expenses arising under this Agreement, the Bylaws or charter documents of the Company or any subsidiary or any statute or law or otherwise, but such indemnification or advancement of
Claims Initiated by the Indemnitee
10
 
expenses may be provided by the Company in specific cases if the Board finds it to be appropriate; or
          (b) . To indemnify the Indemnitee for any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding instituted by the Indemnitee to enforce or interpret this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of the material assertions made by the Indemnitee in such proceeding was not made in good faith or was frivolous; or
Lack of Good Faith
          (c) . To indemnify the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of a proceeding unless the Company consents in advance in writing to such settlement; or
Unauthorized Settlements
          (d) . To indemnify or advance expenses to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to any proceeding or claim brought by the Company against the Indemnitee for willful misconduct, unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that each of such claims was not made in good faith or was frivolous; or
Claims by the Company for Willful Misconduct
          (e) . To indemnify the Indemnitee on account of any suit in which judgment is rendered against the Indemnitee for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale by the Indemnitee of securities of the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act and amendments thereto or similar provisions of any federal, state or local statutory law; or
Section 16(b) Actions
          (f) . To indemnify the Indemnitee on account of the Indemnitee's conduct which is finally adjudged to have been knowingly fraudulent or deliberately dishonest, or to constitute willful misconduct or a knowing violation of law; or
Willful Misconduct
          (g) . To indemnify the Indemnitee if a final decision by a court having jurisdiction in the matter shall determine that such indemnification is not lawful. In this respect, the Company and the Indemnitee have been advised that the Securities and Exchange Commission takes the position that indemnification for liabilities arising under the federal securities laws is against public policy and is, therefore, unenforceable and that claims for indemnification should be submitted to appropriate courts for adjudication.
Unlawful Indemnification
     . The provisions for indemnification and advancement of expenses set forth in this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of, or a substitute for, or to diminish or abrogate, any other rights which the Indemnitee may have under any provision of law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, the vote of the Company's stockholders or Disinterested Directors, other agreements or otherwise, both as to action in the Indemnitee's official capacity and to action in another capacity while occupying his or her position as an agent of the Company; , , that this Agreement shall supersede and replace that certain Indemnity Agreement between the Indemnitee and the Company entered into prior to the Effective Date (the ""), , to the extent that superseding or replacing the Prior Indemnity Agreement with this Agreement would for any reason result in the Indemnitee not being entitled to rights under this Agreement with respect to

any proceeding arising out of any facts, events or circumstances occurring prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement (a ""), then, in such case only, the Indemnitee's rights and obligations under the Prior Indemnity Agreement will survive, but only with respect to any such Pre-Existing Proceeding. The Indemnitee's rights hereunder shall continue after the Indemnitee has ceased acting as an agent of the Company and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of the Indemnitee under this Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by the Indemnitee as an agent prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in the Law, whether by statue or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's Bylaws and this Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the Indemnitee shall enjoy by this Agreement the greater benefits afforded by such change. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other right or remedy.
Pre Existing Proceeding

It is understood that the parties hereto intend this Agreement to be interpreted and enforced so as to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to the Indemnitee to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law, except as expressly limited herein.

     1.      I understand that Intuit Inc. (the "Company") is engaged in a continuous program of research, development, production and marketing in connection with its business and that it is critical for the Company to preserve and protect its Proprietary Information (as defined below), its rights in Inventions (as defined below) and in all related intellectual property rights (collectively referred to as "Intellectual Property"). Accordingly, I am entering into this agreement as a condition of my employment with the Company, whether or not I am expected to create inventions of value for the Company.
     2.      I understand that during the course of my employment with the Company it is likely I will gain access to information of a confidential or secret nature, including but not limited to Inventions (as defined below), marketing plans, product plans, business strategies, financial information, forecasts, personnel information, customer lists, and trade secrets ("Proprietary Information"). Such information may relate to the business of the Company or to the business or any subsidiary, affiliate or any party with whom the Company is bound to hold information of such party confidential.
     3.      I agree that, at all times, both during my employment and after I leave the Company, I will keep and hold any Proprietary Information in strict confidence and trust, and I will not use or disclose any Proprietary Information without first receiving the Company's express written consent, except if compelled by government or court order to do so. Upon leaving the Company, I will promptly give to the Company all documents, materials or property in my possession related to the Company. I will not take with me any property or copies of my work or Company related documents and materials that I have received or used, including Proprietary Information.
     4.      During the course of my employment, I agree to promptly disclose in confidence to the Company all inventions, improvements, designs, original works of authorship, formulas, processes, compositions of matter, computer software programs, databases, mask works and trade secrets ("Inventions") that I make or conceive or first reduce to practice or create, either alone or jointly with others, whether or not in the course of my employment, and whether or not such Inventions are patentable, copyrightable or protectible as trade secrets.
     5.      I understand that, under the copyright laws, any copyrightable works prepared by me within the course and scope of my employment are "works for hire". Consequently, the Company will be considered the author and owner of such works.
     6.      I agree that all Inventions that (a) are developed using equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets of the Company, (b) result from work performed by me for the Company, or (c) relate to the Company's business or current or anticipated research and development, will be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. I hereby assign and agree to transfer to the Company any and all rights that I may have in any such Inventions and in any associated Intellectual Property.
     7.      I also waive and agree never to assert any "Moral Rights" I might have in or with respect to any Invention even after I leave the Company. Moral Rights means any right (or
 
 
similar right existing under the judicial or statutory law of any country or treaty) to claim authorship of any Invention, to object or prevent modification of any Invention, or to withdraw from circulation or to control the publication or distribution of any Invention.
     8.      I agree to assist the Company in every proper way to obtain and enforce the intellectual property protection for any Intellectual Property in any and all countries. I will sign documents that the Company may reasonably request to obtain such protection. My obligations under this paragraph will continue even after I leave the Company, provided the Company will reimburse me at a reasonable rate after I leave the Company for time or expenses actually spent by me on its behalf.

Exhibit 99.01
     MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 17, 2005  Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its second-quarter 2005 revenue increased 5 percent over the year-ago quarter to $662.6 million. Intuit's revenue and profits were higher than the company forecasted three months ago due to stronger-than-expected results in its QuickBooks-Related and Consumer Tax segments.
     "This was a strong quarter for Intuit, especially given that our tax revenue is increasingly shifting to our third quarter," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "While it's too early to declare victory on the entire season, we're pleased with our results in tax. We also had a strong quarter in QuickBooks, with a 38 percent surge in unit growth, including subscriptions."

About pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures
Intuit's management believes that the pro forma financial measures it uses provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these pro forma financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These pro forma financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar pro forma financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Pro forma operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These pro forma financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP or pro forma financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's pro forma financial measures, and the reconciliation of pro forma financial measures to GAAP.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. All of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2005," "Forward-Looking Guidance for Third-Quarter Fiscal 2005, "and "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fourth-Quarter Fiscal 2005"are forward-looking statements. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following: our revenue, profitability and market position can be negatively impacted in an unpredictable manner due to product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which recently announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services, and governmental encroachment in our tax businesses; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; revenue growth for some of our products is slowing and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings instead of our higher priced offerings; we have implemented new information systems but they have not yet utilized in a peak season period, any problems with these new systems, particularly during peak tax season could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to
 
maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in subsequent Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors. We do not undertake any duty to update the information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.
 
See accompanying Notes.
 
The pro forma, or non-GAAP, financial measures above should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

The reconciliations of the forward-looking pro forma financial measures to GAAP in this Table E1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. The adjustments in this table are those that management can predict. Intuit's pro forma financial measures exclude acquisition-related charges, discontinued operations and gains and losses on marketable securities. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable securities.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On March 28, 2005, Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Intuit"), entered into an agreement (the "Lease") with Kilroy Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Landlord"). The Landlord is also the landlord for two properties leased by Intuit located at 6220 and 6200 Greenwich Drive, San Diego, California. Kilroy Realty Corporation is the sole general partner of the Landlord. Kilroy Realty Corporation is the landlord for property leased by Intuit located at 26541 Agoura Road, Calabasas, California and at 3670 Kilroy Airport Way, Long Beach, California.
Under the Lease, Intuit will lease office space of three four-story buildings (the "Buildings") for approximately 365,000 square feet to be constructed by Landlord in an office project called "Santa Fe Summit" located on Torrey Santa Fe Road in San Diego, California (the "Project"). Intuit also has a right of first offer to lease one or more floors of a fourth four-story building for approximately 101,000 square feet at the same location (collectively with the Buildings, the "Premises") and a right of first refusal with respect to any remaining space in the fourth building.
The Lease term will begin on September 1, 2007 and end on the later of August 31, 2017 or ten years after the date Intuit first occupies the Buildings. Intuit has two options to extend the Lease for a period of five years each.
Intuit expects that the maximum base rent for the Premises for years one through five of the Lease will not exceed approximately $2.28 per square foot per month, or about $10.0 million per year. Intuit expects that the maximum base rent for the Premises for years six through ten of the Lease will not exceed approximately $2.69 per square foot per month, or about $11.8 million per year. Included in base rent, Intuit will receive a tenant improvement allowance of $55 per rentable square foot of the Premises (approximately $20.0 million). Intuit expects to make tenant improvements in excess of the landlord tenant improvement allowance. Intuit may elect to increase the landlord tenant improvement allowance by up to an additional $15 per rentable square foot of the Premises (approximately $5.5 million) with a related increase in additional rent. Intuit will be responsible for paying for any additional amounts.
In addition to the lease payments noted above, Intuit will make monthly payments related to common-area maintenance ("CAM"), including amounts for certain of the Landlord's operating expenses, taxes and assessments and various amenities associated with the Project. It is estimated that the CAM expenditures under the Lease will not exceed $30.6 million.
Under the Lease Intuit is obligated to pay for property tax assessments and insurance coverage for the Premises. These amounts may increase over time due to increased property assessments associated with tenant improvements or a sale of the buildings by the Landlord.
Intuit estimates that its maximum total expenditures for all commitments under the Lease will not exceed $147.0 million. Based on currently available information, Intuit expects to account for the Lease in its financial statements as an operating lease.
In addition, on March 28, 2005, Intuit entered into a Third Amendment to Lease with Landlord (the "Third Amendment"), which amends the Build-to-Suit Lease dated June 9, 1995 between Intuit and Landlord for the buildings known as 6220 Greenwich Drive (the "Initial Building") and 6200 Greenwich Drive (the "Additional Building"), San Diego, California, as amended (the "Governor Park Lease").
The Third Amendment extends the term of the Governor Park Lease as to both the Initial Building and the Additional Building from April 16, 2007 or the date that Intuit surrenders possession of the premises upon
Table of Contents
notice to the Landlord ("Extended Term"). The monthly base rent payable during the Extended Term is $305,040. Under the Third Amendment, Intuit has two options to further extend the Extended Term solely with respect to the premises located in the Additional Building for a period of two years and one year, respectively. The monthly installment of base rent payable during any option term will initially be $134,900, and will be increased annually by three percent over the option terms.
Intuit expects to file a copy of the Lease and the Third Amendment as exhibits to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2005.
We incorporate by reference the discussion of the Lease appearing under Item 1.01 above.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Intuit's estimates and expectations of the maximum base rent under the Lease, the amount of CAM payments under the Lease, the amount of expenditures Intuit will incur related to the Premises and the estimated amount of total expenditures under the Lease over the Lease term. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to different materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause results to differ include the following: an increase in the Project costs for purposes of calculating the base rent due to costs from labor disputes or strikes, payment of any performance bond, or increases in assessments on the Premises; an increase in the projected costs for CAM, which are subject to market fluctuations and other factors beyond Intuit's control and therefore difficult to predict; and an increase in tax assessments or insurance or unexpected required upgrades related to the Premises, the cost of which may be incurred by Intuit. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in subsequent Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through out website at . Intuit does not undertake any duty to update the information in this Form 8-K expect as otherwise required by law.

Intuit also agreed that in lieu of providing its standard executive relocation package, it would pay Mr. Henske $5,000 per month for 12 months, such amount to be a net payment grossed up by Intuit for income taxes payable by Mr. Henske and that at the end of that 12 months, Intuit would review that monthly stipend for the following 12 months. The Henske Agreement continues to provide Mr. Henske with severance benefits in the event of his Involuntary Termination, Termination without Cause, and Termination Following a Change in Control, equal to 18 months of his then-current base salary and one and one-half times of his target bonus for the then-current fiscal year, plus accelerated vesting of the 400,000 share option grant awarded to him in January 2003 in connection with his commencing employment with Intuit; as of the date hereof, Mr. Henske will vest as to all shares under this option on January 3, 2006. The above description is qualified in its entirety by the Henske Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.01.

Exhibit 99.01
       Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its third-quarter 2005 revenue increased 20 percent over the year-ago quarter to $849.5 million from $709.8 million.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  May 18, 2005
      "This was an outstanding quarter for Intuit," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Revenue and profits were significantly higher than last year's third quarter  largely driven by an outstanding consumer tax season and another great quarter for QuickBooks."
Third-Quarter 2005 Financial Highlights
Third-Quarter 2005 Business Portfolio and Segment Results
 
Company Plans to Sell Information Technology Solutions Business
      Intuit said it has decided to sell its Information Technology Solutions (ITS) business, which sells Track-It! software.
      "The market for our ITS business has changed," said Bennett. "As a result, ITS would require much greater focus and additional investments to be accretive to Intuit's revenue growth rate in the future. We've identified better investment opportunities in our core businesses."
      Intuit's ITS has contributed $42.3 million in revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal 2005 and $0.05 in GAAP fully diluted EPS and $0.06 in non-GAAP fully diluted EPS.
      While ITS performance is included in the results Intuit reported today and will be included in its upcoming Form 10-Q, it will be treated as a discontinued business in future financial filings, as required. As a result, Intuit did not include past or future results from ITS when it developed non-GAAP fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2005 guidance, but has included it in GAAP EPS guidance in accordance with accounting rules.
Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2005
Intuit's guidance for fiscal 2005 is unchanged except for the exclusion of results from its ITS business:
Forward-Looking Guidance for Fourth-Quarter 2005
Except for the exclusion of ITS, fourth-quarter guidance remains the same:

Intuit's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures it uses provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting.

Non-GAAP operating income excludes acquisition-related charges, such as amortization of intangibles and impairment charges, as well as amortization of purchased software and charges for purchased research and development. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share exclude discontinued operations, gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments, as well as the tax effects of these transactions. These non-GAAP financial measures are not
 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and likely are different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The accompanying tables and fact sheet have more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's non-GAAP financial measures, and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. All of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2005," and "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fourth-Quarter 2005" are forward-looking statements. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following: our revenue, profitability and market position can be negatively impacted in an unpredictable manner due to product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which recently announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services, and governmental encroachment in our tax businesses; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; revenue growth for some of our products is slowing and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings instead of our higher priced offerings; we have implemented new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in subsequent Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors. We do not undertake any duty to update the information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
 
 
 
The non-GAAP financial measures above should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and likely are different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Intuit's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. See Tables B1 and B2 for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This financial information contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. The numbers provided under the headings "Forecast Q405" and "Forecast FY05" in the table entitled "Intuit Non-GAAP Statement of Operations (excluding ITS)" and all of the numbers provided in the table entitled "Reconciliation of Guidance for Non- GAAP Financial Measures to Projected GAAP Revenue, Operating Income and EPS" are forward-looking statements. A number of risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expressed expectations. Some of the important factors that could cause our results to differ include the following. Our revenue, profitability and market position could be negatively impacted in an unpredictable manner due to product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which recently announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services, and governmental encroachment in our tax businesses. Our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise. Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. It is a challenge for us to predict tax-related revenues due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period. Revenue growth for some of our products is slowing, and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives. Our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings instead of our higher priced offerings. We have implemented new information systems, and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to manage effectively our business. Litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. Our failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in subsequent Form 10-Q and other SEC filings.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Funding of 2005 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
     On July 27, 2005, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") approved funding for the payment of annual performance bonuses under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2005 ("Fiscal 2005") in the aggregate amount of $88,340,000. Over 90% of Intuit's employees, including each of our named executive officers except for our President and Chief Executive Officer, are eligible for annual performance bonus awards under the IPI for Fiscal 2005.
Approval of Fiscal Year 2005 Bonus Awards
     Stephen M. Bennett, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is eligible to receive an annual performance bonus for Fiscal 2005 under our Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"), provided that the performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for Fiscal 2005 are achieved. On July 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee fixed the amount of Mr. Bennett's annual performance bonus for Fiscal 2005 at $2,772,000, subject to certification by the Compensation Committee after July 31, 2005 that the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) performance goals for Fiscal 2005 have been achieved. On August 1, 2005, the Compensation Committee certified that the performance goals for Mr. Bennett's annual performance bonus for Fiscal 2005 had been met.
     Also on July 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee fixed the amount of the annual performance bonuses payable to each of our named executive officers under the IPI for Fiscal 2005. The Fiscal 2005 bonus amounts were determined by the Compensation Committee based on its review with management of the performance of each of the named executive officers. The following table sets forth the amount of the Fiscal 2005 bonus to be paid to each of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Bennett whose bonus is payable under the SEIP described above):
Table of Contents
Approval of 2006 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
     On July 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006 ("Fiscal 2006"), a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for Fiscal 2006 will be based upon the employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during Fiscal 2006, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for Fiscal 2006. A copy of the IPI for Fiscal 2006 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.1.
Performance Based Restricted Stock Units
     On July 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the grant on July 29, 2005 of a 50,000 share restricted stock unit ("RSU") to Mr. Bennett under the Intuit Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. Vesting of the RSU is subject to the achievement of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for Fiscal 2006, which include targets based upon both Intuit's net revenue and operating income for Fiscal 2006. If the performance goals for Fiscal 2006 are achieved, the RSU will vest on July 29, 2008. If the performance goals for Fiscal 2006 are not achieved, the RSU will terminate without vesting. We will only issue vested shares to Mr. Bennett. In the event of Mr. Bennett's "Involuntary Termination" or "Termination without Cause" (as defined in his July 30, 2003 Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Employment Agreement")), the RSU will automatically vest as to a percentage of the total number of shares subject to the RSU equal to his number of full months of service from the date of grant to the date of termination of his employment divided by thirty-six months. In the event of Mr. Bennett's "Termination Following a Change in Control" (as defined in his Employment Agreement), the RSU will automatically vest as to 100% of the total number of shares subject to the RSU.
Table of Contents
CEO Annual Base Salary
     On July 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Bennett's base salary to $1,100,000 for Fiscal 2006.
Senior Vice President Relocation Benefit
     On August 1, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the terms of certain relocation benefit payments to Brad Smith. As a result of Mr. Smith's appointment as our Senior Vice President/General Manager, QuickBooks, Mr. Smith was required to relocate from San Diego, California to the San Francisco Bay Area. In connection with his relocation, we provided Mr. Smith with our standard executive relocation package, enhanced to include a relocation allowance payment equal to two month's salary. Mr. Smith will also receive a mortgage subsidy in an amount not to exceed $300,000. The mortgage subsidy will be paid in monthly installments over a period of five years. The amount of the mortgage subsidy will be calculated based upon the interest that would be payable by Mr. Smith on a 30-year fixed rate first mortgage on his new home assuming an interest rate equal to 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% and 1% for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth year of the mortgage, respectively. The mortgage subsidy will terminate upon the termination of Mr. Smith's employment for any reason. In addition, we will pay to the taxing authorities on Mr. Smith's behalf an amount, not to exceed $50,000, representing an income tax gross-up relating to a mortgage loan origination payment. We also will pay to the taxing authorities on Mr. Smith's behalf an amount, not to exceed $60,000, representing an income tax gross-up relating to additional income taxes paid by Mr. Smith as a result of our 2004 payment to Mr. Smith of the amount of his loss on the sale of his home in Texas and the closing costs associated with that sale.
1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     On July 27, 2005, the Compensation Committee approved the amendment and restatement of our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan extending the termination date of the plan from October 7, 2006 until July 27, 2015.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. Intuit's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to Intuit's core operating results. In addition, the forward-looking guidance for non-GAAP income, loss, earnings per share and loss per share in fiscal 2006 excludes estimated expenses for stock-based compensation and associated taxes that Intuit will begin recording under SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These estimated stock-based compensation expenses and associated taxes are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures in order to facilitate the comparison of guidance for future periods with results for past periods, which did not include such stock-based compensation expenses. Intuit's management refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Non-GAAP operating income excludes amortization of purchased assets and acquisition-related charges. Non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share exclude gains and losses on marketable securities and other investments and the tax effects of these items as well as net income or loss from discontinued operations. In addition, the forward-looking guidance for non-GAAP income, loss, earnings per share and loss per share in fiscal 2006 excludes estimated expenses for stock-based compensation and associated taxes that Intuit will begin recording under SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The accompanying tables and sheet entitled "Intuit Facts" provide more details on Intuit's historical performance and financial projections, the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to Intuit's non-GAAP financial measures, and the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. All of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2006,"and "Forward-Looking Guidance for First-Quarter 2006"are forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which has announced its intention to target small business customers with accounting software and associated services, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; revenue growth for some of our products is slowing and we must successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product offerings may not succeed or they may negatively impact our profitability if customers elect to purchase lower-priced simplified offerings instead of our higher priced offerings; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2004 and in our subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 24, 2005, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in this press release except as otherwise required by law.

Total costs and expenses and each of the line items below it except interest and other income in Table A2 are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. Intuit's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results because they exclude amounts that are not related to Intuit's core operating results. Intuit's management refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. In addition, Intuit has historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believes that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in its financial reporting. Intuit computes non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Tables B1 and B2 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
The accompanying document entitled "Intuit Facts" also includes non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude estimated expenses for stock-based compensation and the associated taxes that Intuit will begin recording under SFAS 123(R) in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These estimated stock-based compensation expenses and the associated taxes are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures in order to facilitate the comparison of guidance for future periods with results for past periods, which did not include such stock-based compensation expenses. Tables E1 and E2 provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures in the "Intuit Facts" document to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tables E1 and E2 reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures presented in the accompanying document entitled "Intuit Facts" and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies.

Intuit computes non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in this Table E1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. This table includes adjustments that management can reasonably predict. Intuit's non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of purchased assets, acquisition-related charges, gains and losses on marketable securities and discontinued operations. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable securities.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 25, 2005 the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. (the "Compensation Committee") established the threshold performance goal for the fiscal 2006 bonuses payable to executive officers Stephen M. Bennett, Robert B. Henske, Richard W. Ihrie, Alexander M. Lintner, Kiran M. Patel and Brad D. Smith under Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"). The SEIP is a cash incentive plan that was approved by Intuit's stockholders in December 2002. The purposes of the SEIP are to motivate senior executives by tying compensation to performance, reward exceptional performance that supports overall Intuit objectives, and attract and retain top performing employees. Under the SEIP, the Committee establishes one or more performance goals for each fiscal year. A copy of the SEIP is attached as an appendix to Intuit's 2002 proxy statement filed October 23, 2002.
The Committee established a threshold performance goal based on a specified revenue target that Intuit must achieve as a condition to payment of any bonuses under the SEIP for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006. The maximum bonus payout under the SEIP is $5 million per participant. If the threshold performance goal is achieved, actual individual bonus amounts will be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon such performance criteria as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The bonus payments are also subject to the other terms of the SEIP.

Exhibit 99.01
Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its first-quarter 2006 revenue increased 20 percent over the year-ago quarter to $304.1 million. Growth was primarily driven by strong sales of its QuickBooks software and add-on solutions. The company's first quarter ended on Oct. 31, 2005.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Nov. 16, 2005 
          "Intuit delivered a terrific first quarter and we've raised our outlook for the fiscal year," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "With our strongest-ever QuickBooks lineup now on the shelves and a great TurboTax lineup launching next week, we're excited about the balance of the fiscal year."
First-Quarter 2006 Financial Highlights
          Intuit posted a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net loss of $45.8 million versus a net loss of $46.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. This represents a net loss of $0.26 per diluted share versus a net loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter 2006 results included approximately $12 million after tax, or $0.07 per share, in expenses associated with employee stock options and purchases under Intuit's employee stock purchase plan. Intuit's first-quarter 2005 GAAP results did not include options expense. Intuit typically posts a seasonal loss in its first quarter when it has little revenue from its tax businesses.
 
          Intuit posted a non-GAAP net loss of $45.8 million versus a net loss of $47.1 million in the first quarter of 2005. The first-quarter non-GAAP net loss was $0.26 per diluted share versus a net loss of $0.25 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. A lower share count caused the per share loss to widen year-over-year.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of our expected financial results. Other statements relating to the future are also forward-looking, including: our expectations regarding future market opportunities; our prospects for the business in fiscal 2006 and beyond; our expectations regarding future stock repurchases; all of the statements under the headings "Fiscal 2006 Guidance" and "Second Quarter 2006 Guidance;" our objectives regarding future revenue growth and EPS growth; our assessment of potential growth opportunities; and our expectations regarding the launch of new or improved products and services.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including competition from Microsoft, which has released accounting software and associated services for small business customers, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively effect our operating results and market position; current and future products and services, including the 2006 edition of QuickBooks, may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives; our new product or service offerings may not attract customers or they may negatively impact our profitability if the business models for new offerings are not successful or if customers elect to purchase lower-priced alternatives; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs; and our failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2005 and in other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at .

Exhibit 99.01
      Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its second quarter 2006 revenue increased 15 percent over the year-ago quarter to $742.7 million. Growth was driven by strong sales of QuickBooks software and add-on solutions and TurboTax products and services. Revenue growth also benefited from changes in the TurboTax offering and pricing, which shifted approximately $35 million of revenue into the second quarter that in prior years would have been recognized in the third quarter. Without that timing shift, Intuit's revenue would have increased 9 percent.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 16, 2006
     "Intuit delivered another strong quarter and we're on track for another strong year," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Our two largest businesses  QuickBooks and TurboTax  continued to perform very well as we successfully execute strategies to expand our customer base and solve more of our customers' needs."
Second-Quarter 2006 Financial Highlights
     Intuit posted GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income of $184.9 million, up 26 percent from the year-ago quarter. GAAP diluted earnings per share, or EPS, was $1.02, up 32 percent from the year-ago quarter. Second-quarter 2006 GAAP results benefited from a gain of approximately $0.14 per share from the sale of its Information Technology Solutions business. GAAP results also included approximately $0.06 per share for share-based compensation expenses.
 
     Intuit's non-GAAP net income of $176.5 million was up 17 percent over the prior-year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.97, up 21 percent over the prior-year period.
Second-Quarter 2006 Business Segment Results
Fiscal 2006 Guidance
     Intuit raised its EPS guidance for fiscal 2006, which will end on July 31, 2006, to reflect the strength of first-half performance and greater visibility into the remainder of the year. It also raised the low end of its fiscal 2006 revenue guidance. The company expects:
 
Third-Quarter 2006 Guidance

Exhibit 99.01
 On June 26, 2006, Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) received a subpoena from the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting documents related to the company's historical stock option practices. It is our belief that similar subpoenas have been served on many of the companies named in a recent report from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (CFRA). As disclosed on June 9, 2006, Intuit received an informal request from the Securities and Exchange Commission for information on historical stock option practices.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.,  June 29, 2006
          We will fully cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's office.
          As also previously disclosed, in May 2006 when we first learned of the CFRA report, Intuit's Board of Directors initiated a voluntary independent review of our historical stock option grant activities and related accounting treatment. This ongoing review is being conducted by independent members of the board, independent legal counsel and accountants.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Approval of Fiscal Year 2006 Bonus Awards and Fiscal 2007 Base Salaries for Senior Executives
     Several of our senior executive officers are eligible to receive an annual performance incentive payment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2006 ("Fiscal 2006") under our Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"), provided that the performance goals established by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee (the "Committee") for Fiscal 2006 are achieved. The senior executives eligible for a bonus under the SEIP are: Stephen M. Bennett, Robert B. Henske, Richard William Ihrie, Alexander M. Lintner, Kiran M. Patel, and Brad D. Smith. At meetings held on July 25 and July 26, 2006, the Committee fixed the amount of annual performance bonuses under the SEIP, subject to certification by the Committee after July 31, 2006 that the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) performance goals for Fiscal 2006 have been achieved. The bonus amounts to be paid to these senior executives were determined by the Committee based on its review with management of the performance of each of the executive officers.
     On July 26, 2005, the Compensation Committee also approved the annual performance bonuses payable to our other senior executive officers, including bonuses for Scott D. Cook and for William V. Campbell, under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2006. The Fiscal 2006 bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on its review with management of the performance of each of the executive officers.
     At its meetings on July 25 and July 26, 2006, the Committee also approved the annual base salaries for the Company's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the Fiscal 2006 bonus and the 2007 annual base salary approved for each person designated as a "named executive officer" in our 2005 annual proxy statement, each person expected to be so designated in our 2006 annual proxy statement and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

Restricted Stock Units
     On July 25, 2006, the Committee approved two forms of agreements for use in granting awards of restricted stock units ("SUs") under the Intuit Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") to employees.
     The Committee approved the form of performance-based SU agreement for use in granting performance-based SUs, a copy of which is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01. Vesting of the performance-based SUs is subject to the achievement of performance goals established by the Committee for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2007 ("Fiscal 2007"), which include targets based upon both Intuit's net revenue and operating income for Fiscal 2007 and the recipient's continued service. If the performance goals for Fiscal 2007 are not achieved, the performance-based SUs will terminate without vesting. We will only issue vested shares under the terms of these performance-based SUs. Upon the occurrence of certain events, performance-based SUs will automatically vest as to a percentage of the total number of shares subject to the SUs.
     Additionally, the Committee approved the form of service-based SU agreement for use in granting SUs to employees, a copy of which is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.02.
     The Committee also approved the award of a 100,000-share SU to be granted to Stephen M. Bennett, Intuit's President and Chief Executive Officer, on the third business day following Intuit's earnings announcement. The 100,000 share SU will be granted under the 2005 Plan. Vesting of the SU is subject to the achievement of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2008, which are based upon both Intuit's net revenue and operating income for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2008. If both the performance goals for Fiscal 2007 are achieved, the SU will vest in part on July 31, 2007. If the performance goals for Fiscal 2007 are not achieved, a portion of the SU will terminate without vesting. If both the performance goals for Fiscal 2008 are achieved, the remaining unvested portion of the SU will vest on July 31, 2008. If the performance goals for Fiscal 2008 are not achieved, a portion of the SU will terminate without vesting. We will only issue vested shares to Mr. Bennett. In the event of Mr. Bennett's "Involuntary Termination" or "Termination without Cause" (as defined in his Employment Agreement), the SU will automatically vest as to a percentage of the total number of shares subject to the SU equal to his number of full months of service from the date of grant to the date of termination of his employment divided by twenty-four months. In the event of Mr. Bennett's "Termination Following a Change in Control" (as defined in his Employment Agreement), the SU will automatically vest as to 100% of the total number of shares subject to the SU.
Funding of 2006 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
     On July 25, 2006, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") approved funding for the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees (other than senior executive officers eligible to receive bonuses under the SEIP) under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2006 in the aggregate amount of $97,000,000. More than 90% of Intuit's full time employees, excluding the senior executives who were eligible for the SEIP, are eligible for annual performance bonus awards under the IPI for Fiscal 2006.
Approval of 2007 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
     On July 25, 2006, the Compensation Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal 2007, a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for Fiscal 2007 will be based upon the employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during Fiscal 2007, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for Fiscal 2007 based on overall Company performance. A copy of the IPI for Fiscal 2007 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.3.

Amendment to 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
     On July 26, 2006, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan in order to reduce the number of formula-based stock option grants to be granted to non-employee directors pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Plan. As a result of this amendment, non-employee directors shall be eligible to receive the following option grants subject to the terms and conditions of the 2005 Plan: (a) Initial Grant, 67,500 shares, (b) annual Succeeding Grant, 22,500 shares, (c) annual grants for any Board-designated Chairpersons of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, 10,000 shares and (d) annual grants for other members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, 7,500 shares.

These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors, including Microsoft, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation, our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal tax returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2005 and in our other SEC filings.

The accompanying press release dated August 22, 2006 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables B and E1 reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In addition, Tables E1 and E2 reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures found in the accompanying document entitled "Intuit Facts" to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure. All share and per share figures in this Table B retroactively reflect our July 2006 two-for-one common stock split.

Management Stock Purchase Program
On October 24, 2006, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. (the "Compensation Committee") approved the implementation of a Management Stock Purchase Program ("MSPP") to commence on January 1, 2007. The purpose of the MSPP is to encourage ownership of Intuit's stock by members of management. Under the MSPP, employees at the director level and above (other than the Chief Executive Officer) will have the opportunity to elect to defer up to 15% of their annual bonus. This deferral will be converted into restricted stock units ("RSUs") based on the fair market value of Intuit's common stock on the date such bonus is awarded. Intuit will grant each employee who participates in the MSPP an additional RSU for every RSU purchased through such deferral, up to set maximums. These matching RSUs will vest as to 100% of the shares subject to the award three years after the grant date, or on the recipient's death or disability. The RSUs granted pursuant to the MSPP will be issued under Intuit's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein.
Senior Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goal
On October 25, 2006 the Compensation Committee established the threshold performance goal for the fiscal 2007 bonuses payable to executive officers Stephen M. Bennett, Robert B. Henske, Alexander M. Lintner, Kiran M. Patel and Brad D. Smith under Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"). The SEIP is a cash incentive plan that was approved by Intuit's stockholders in December 2002. The purposes of the SEIP are to motivate senior executives by tying compensation to performance, reward exceptional performance that supports overall Intuit objectives, and attract and retain top performing employees. Under the SEIP, the Compensation Committee establishes one or more performance goals for each fiscal year. A copy of the SEIP is attached as an appendix to Intuit's 2002 proxy statement filed October 23, 2002. The Compensation Committee established a threshold performance goal based on a specified revenue target that Intuit must achieve as a condition to payment of any bonuses under the SEIP for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2007. The maximum bonus payout under the SEIP is $5 million per participant. If the threshold performance goal is achieved, actual individual bonus amounts will be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon such performance criteria as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The bonus payments are also subject to the other terms of the SEIP.
On October 25, 2006, Donna L. Dubinsky informed the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. that she will not stand for re-election at Intuit's annual meeting of stockholders on December 15, 2006. Ms. Dubinsky, who has served as a director of Intuit since 1999, indicated that her decision not to stand for re-election was made for personal reasons, which will require her to spend significant time outside the San Francisco Bay area.

Exhibit 99.01
Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) announced today that the Securities and Exchange Commission has formally notified Intuit that its investigation of Intuit's historical stock option granting practices has been terminated and that it will not recommend any enforcement action.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Oct. 30, 2006 
          As disclosed in June 2006, Intuit received an informal request from the SEC for information on historical stock option granting practices. A special committee of independent members of Intuit's Board of Directors conducted a review of these practices. In August 2006, Intuit announced the completion of this independent review, which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in the company's historical stock option granting practices. Based on this review, Intuit concluded that it did not need to restate its historical financial statements. Intuit presented the results of this independent review to the SEC and to the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California. The U.S. Attorney has also received the same information submitted to the SEC and has not made any additional requests for information.

Exhibit 99.01
- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its first-quarter 2007 revenue increased 19 percent over the year-ago quarter to $362.1 million. Growth was primarily driven by strong sales of its QuickBooks software and add-on solutions, payroll and payments. Approximately $20 million of first-quarter revenue was attributed to the September launch of QuickBooks 2007, which was about 30 days earlier than last year. Without this earlier launch, revenue growth would have been approximately 12 percent.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Nov. 16, 2006
     "Intuit just completed another successful quarter," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "QuickBooks 2007 is off to a great start, and our Payroll and Payments segment also performed very well. With a new lineup of TurboTax products just launched, we're excited about the balance of the fiscal year."

First-Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights
     Intuit posted a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net loss of $58.9 million versus a net loss of $45.8 million in the first quarter of 2006. This represents a net loss of $0.17 per share versus a net loss of $0.13 per share in the year-ago quarter. First-quarter 2006 results included $11.8 million, or $0.03 per share, of net income from discontinued operations. Intuit typically posts a seasonal loss in its first quarter when it has little revenue from its tax businesses.
     Intuit posted a non-GAAP net loss of $42.5 million versus a non-GAAP net loss of $45.0 million in the first quarter of 2006. The first-quarter non-GAAP net loss was $0.12 per share versus a non-GAAP net loss of $0.13 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains: forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2007 and beyond; all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from competitors, including Microsoft, can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position. Governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position. We may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation. Our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue due to potential customers filing free federal tax returns and electing not to pay for state filing or other services and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise. Any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation. Our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results. Predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period. We have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business. Our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow. Litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our Web site at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of Nov. 16, 2006, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in this press release.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On November 29, 2006, Intuit Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Intuit"), entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire Digital Insight Corporation ("Digital Insight") in a merger transaction pursuant to which Digital Insight will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intuit (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and subject to the conditions thereof, Intuit will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Digital Insight Corporation Common Stock for a cash amount of $39.00 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.35 billion on a fully diluted basis. Intuit will assume Digital Insight's stock options which are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than options held by non-employee directors of Digital Insight). Each assumed Digital Insight stock option will be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Intuit common stock equal to $39.00 divided by the average closing sales price for a share of Intuit Common Stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the ten consecutive trading days ending with the third trading day that precedes the closing date of the Merger. Each unvested Digital Insight stock option held by non-employee directors of Digital Insight will be accelerated and all outstanding options held by non-employee directors will receive a cash payment equal to the difference of $39.00 per share multiplied by the number of Digital Insight shares subject to the option, less the aggregate exercise price of the option. Payment for unvested shares of restricted stock will be made in cash on the date that such shares would have become vested in accordance with the holders' restricted stock vesting schedules. This transaction will be taxable to Digital Insight stockholders.
     Each of Digital Insight's disinterested directors and certain of its executive officers have agreed, in their capacity as stockholders of Digital Insight, to vote their shares in favor of the Merger and against any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with the Merger.
     The consummation of the Merger is subject to regulatory review, Digital Insight stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions. Dates for closing the Merger and for Digital Insight's stockholders' meeting to vote on the Merger have not yet been determined.
     Intuit expects to file a copy of the Merger Agreement as an exhibit to its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending January 31, 2007. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement for a more complete understanding of the transaction. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.
ITEM 7.01 REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
     On November 30, 2006, Intuit issued a joint press release with Digital Insight announcing the transaction described in Item 1.01 above. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.01 hereto.
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.01
Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) and Digital Insight Corp. (Nasdaq: DGIN) have signed a definitive agreement for Intuit to acquire Digital Insight. Under the terms of the agreement, Intuit will pay $39 per share in cash for each Digital Insight common share. The total purchase price is approximately $1.35 billion on a fully diluted basis.
MOUNTAIN VIEW and CALABASAS, Calif.  Nov. 30, 2006 
     The acquisition will bring together Digital Insight, a leading provider of online banking services, and Intuit, the leading provider of financial management software, to millions of small businesses and consumers. Together, the companies will serve more than 5,000 financial institutions, nearly 25 million consumers and nearly 7 million small businesses. The acquisition will combine Intuit's culture of customer-driven innovation and leading brands with Digital Insight's best-in-class distribution and application service provider model.
     "The combination of two industry leaders will put Intuit in an excellent position to bring a new generation of online banking solutions to market in a way that will redefine the way small businesses and consumers manage their financial lives," said Steve Bennett, Intuit president and chief executive officer.
     With the acquisition, Intuit will be able to combine work flows in its financial management tools with online banking capability offered by Digital Insight to create new, easier, and better-value offerings for consumers and small businesses.
 
     "Online banking is growing rapidly, but today's solutions don't meet the needs of most small businesses and many consumers," said Jeff Stiefler, Digital Insight chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Digital Insight's and Intuit's combined assets and competencies will change the game for small businesses, consumers and the financial institutions that serve them. In addition to the clear business benefit of this proposed acquisition, both companies have already had the opportunity to work closely together to develop the mutual trust and respect that is a critical prerequisite for any business combination to be successful."
     Following the closing of the acquisition, Digital Insight's business operations will continue to operate from its existing facilities in California and Georgia. The Digital Insight business operations will establish the foundation for a newly formed financial institutions business division within Intuit, with Stiefler serving as that unit's president.
     The transaction is subject to regulatory review, Digital Insight shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. After closing, expected in the first calendar quarter of 2007, Digital Insight will become part of Intuit, and Digital Insight stock will cease trading. Intuit plans to finance the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and up to $1 billion of debt financing, although there are no financing contingencies in the merger agreement. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to Intuit by two to three cents per share on a non GAAP basis in its current fiscal year and slightly accretive on a non GAAP basis in fiscal 2008.

Under the terms of this plan, Mr. Cook's family trust will sell 500,000 shares and contribute 100,000 shares to the charitable foundation each quarter.
     The Scott Cook and Signe Ostby Charitable Foundation also adopted a stock trading plan in December 2006 to sell the 400,000 shares of Intuit stock contributed by Mr. Cook's family trust during the same period.
     In January 2007, William V. Campbell, Chairman of the Board of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of shares issuable pursuant to an option granted in June 1997, which expires in June 2007. Pursuant to the plan, a brokerage firm may exercise Mr. Campbell's stock option and sell up to 409,212 shares of Intuit stock in May or June 2007, shortly before the expiration date of the option.

          With respect to our opinion in paragraph 2 below, we have relied solely upon Borrower's certification in the Management Certificate identifying those agreements of Borrower that Borrower considers to be material with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the transactions contemplated to be carried out in
 
accordance with and pursuant to the Credit Agreement and copies, supplied to us by Borrower, of such Material Agreements that are expressly listed and identified as "Material Agreements" on hereto and in the Management Certificate. We have not undertaken any independent investigation of such matters.
Exhibit B
          With respect to our opinion in paragraph 3 below, we note that the Credit Agreement and/or the Notes may be required to be filed and/or disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K by Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
          We are admitted to practice law in the State of California and in the State of New York. The opinions expressed herein are limited to the existing internal laws of the State of California, the existing laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law as in effect on the date hereof (the ""), and the existing federal laws of the United States of America, assuming that such laws apply to the matters expressed herein. To the extent that any of the Reviewed Documents (other than the Credit Agreement and the Notes) are governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of California or New York, or the United States federal law as described above, we have assumed with your permission that those laws are the same as the relevant laws of the State of California and our opinion relating to those documents is based solely upon the apparent meaning of the language, without regard to interpretation or construction that might be indicated by the laws governing those agreements. Our opinion is limited to such California and New York state and United States federal statutes, laws, rules or regulations, and provisions of the DGCL, as in our experience are of general application to transactions of the sort contemplated by the Credit Agreement.
DGCL
          With respect to our enforceability opinion in paragraph 4 below, our opinion is limited to the existing laws of the State of New York. With respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes, we have assumed that in a proceeding outside of New York that the choice of New York state law would be given effect and would exclusively apply to and govern the Credit Agreement.
          In rendering the opinions below, we are opining only as to the specific legal issues expressly set forth therein, and no opinion shall be inferred as to any other matter or matters.
          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to all of the assumptions, qualifications, exceptions and limitations contained herein, we are of the following opinion:
     1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Borrower's Board of Directors and, where required, its shareholders, and do not (i) violate the terms of the Charter or the By-laws, (ii) violate any California State, New York State or United States federal law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (iii) result in the breach of any Material Agreement. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
     3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any California State, New York State, or United States federal, governmental authority or regulatory body, or pursuant to the DGCL to any governmental authority or regulatory body, is required for the due execution, delivery and performance, as of the date hereof, by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
     4. The Credit Agreement is, and after giving effect to the initial Borrowing, the Notes will be, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On February 6, 2007, pursuant to a merger agreement dated November 29, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Intuit Inc. (the "Company"), Digital Insight Corporation ("Digital Insight") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), Merger Sub merged with and into Digital Insight, which resulted in Digital Insight becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Merger"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company paid a cash amount of $39.00 per share for each outstanding share of Digital Insight common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.33 billion including the value of assumed Digital Insight stock options. At the effective time of the Merger, the Company assumed outstanding Digital Insight stock options, which were converted into options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.47 million shares of the Company's common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $21.36 per share, based on the conversion ratio set forth in the Merger Agreement.
     The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement (including the description of the consideration paid in connection with the Merger) is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.01 to this report and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
     On January 31, 2007, Intuit entered into a Bridge Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") by and among Intuit, the Lenders parties thereto (the "Lenders"), Chase Lincoln First Commercial Corporation, as syndication agent, and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1 billion unsecured credit facility (the "Facility") that will expire on February 5, 2008. On February 6, 2007, Intuit borrowed the full $1 billion available under the Facility to finance, in part, Intuit's acquisition of Digital Insight.
     Intuit is required to prepay loans under the Credit Agreement with the proceeds of any issuance by Intuit or its subsidiaries of equity securities, or the incurrence by Intuit or its subsidiaries of debt for borrowed money, subject to certain exceptions. The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.
     For additional information regarding the Credit Agreement, see Item 2.03 to the Form 8-K filed by Intuit on February 1, 2007. A copy of the Credit Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.01 to that Form 8-K.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
     Effective upon the consummation of the Merger, the Special Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Jeffrey E. Stiefler as a Senior Vice President of the Company and President of the Company's Financial Institutions Division. Under the terms of an employment offer letter, Mr. Stiefler's starting annual salary will be $600,000, and he will be eligible to receive a pro-rated bonus equal to 75% of his base salary for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2007, based on achievements by the Company and Mr. Stiefler's individual performance, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2007 Intuit Performance Incentive Plan.
     Pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Stiefler will also be granted an option to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which will vest as to 100% of the shares on the second anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, provided that he remains employed by the Company on that date. If Mr. Stiefler is terminated without "cause" or he resigns by reason of an "involuntary termination" (as each term is defined in his offer letter) within twelve months following the closing date of the Merger, and he executes a release in favor of the Company, then the number of option shares equal to 1/24 of the total number of option shares multiplied by the number of full months that Mr. Stiefler remained employed since the closing date of the Merger will immediately vest upon such termination or resignation.
Table of Contents
     Pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Stiefler will also be granted 100,000 performance-based restricted stock units. These restricted stock units will vest on the thirty-month anniversary of the closing date of the Merger if the Company determines that certain performance goals have been satisfied and Mr. Stiefler is employed by the Company on such date. If Mr. Stiefler's employment is terminated without "cause" or if he resigns by reason of an "involuntary termination" (as each term is defined in his offer letter), and Mr. Stiefler executes a release in favor of the Company, then the number of stock units equal to 1/30 of the total number of stock units multiplied by the number of full months Mr. Stiefler remained employed following the closing date of the Merger will immediately vest upon such termination or resignation.
     Pursuant to the terms of Digital Insight's Change in Control Severance Plan and the offer letter, conditioned upon execution of a release related to his prior employment with Digital Insight, Mr. Stiefler also received full acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of all his unvested Digital Insight options (375,564 shares) and unvested Digital Insight restricted stock (67,083 shares) and received a lump sum cash payment of $1,777,661.
     Mr. Stiefler's offer letter provides that he is entitled to a tax gross-up on any excise taxes which he may be required to pay as a result of any excess parachute payments resulting from payments by Digital Insight or the Company, subject to the restrictions set forth in the offer letter.
     If Mr. Stiefler's employment is terminated other than for "cause" or he resigns due to an "involuntary termination" (as each term is defined in his offer letter), he will be entitled to receive three months of professional outplacement services from the date his employment terminates.
     Mr. Stiefler has also executed a Non-Competition Agreement as a condition of employment with the Company. The Non-Competition Agreement subjects Mr. Stiefler to a three-year non-competition period that commences on the closing date of the Merger and a one-year non-solicitation restriction period from the date of termination of his employment with the Company.

     1. I understand that Intuit Inc. (the "") is engaged in a continuous program of research, development, production and marketing in connection with its business and that it is critical for the Company to preserve and protect its Proprietary Information (as defined below), its rights in Company Inventions (as defined below) and in all related worldwide patents, patent applications, copyrights, mask works, trademarks, trades secrets and other intellectual property rights (""). Accordingly, I am entering into this agreement ("") as a condition of my employment with the Company, whether or not I am expected to create inventions of value for the Company.
Company
Intellectual Property Rights
Agreement
     2. I understand that during the course of my employment with the Company it is likely I will gain access to information of a confidential or secret nature that may be disclosed to me by the Company or a third party that relates to the business of the Company or to the business of any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, acquired entity, customer or supplier of the Company or any other party with whom the Company agrees to hold information of such party in confidence (""). Proprietary Information includes, but is not limited to, Company Inventions (as defined below), marketing plans, product plans, business strategies, financial information, forecasts, personnel information, customer lists, supplier lists, and trade secrets. I understand that Proprietary Information does not include any of the items just listed which has become publicly known and made generally available through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the publicized item or items involved.
Proprietary Information
     3. I agree that, at all times, both during my employment and after I leave the Company, I will keep and hold any Proprietary Information in strict confidence and trust, and I will not use or disclose any Proprietary Information without first receiving the Company's express written consent, except as may be necessary to perform my duties as an employee of the Company for the benefit of the Company and except if compelled by government or court order to do so. Upon leaving the Company, I will promptly give to the Company all documents, materials or property in my possession related to the Company. I will not take with me any property or copies of my work or Company related documents and materials that I have received or used, including Proprietary Information.
     4. During the period of my employment, I agree to promptly disclose in confidence to the Company all inventions, improvements, designs, original works of authorship, formulas, processes, compositions of matter, computer software programs, databases, mask works and trade secrets that I conceive or first reduce to practice or create, either alone or jointly with others, whether or not in the course of my employment, and whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectible as trade secrets or other Intellectual Property Rights ("").
Inventions
     5. I understand that, under the copyright laws, any copyrightable works prepared by me within the scope of my employment are "works for hire." Consequently, the Company will be considered the author and owner of such works.
 
     6. I agree that all Inventions that (a) are developed using equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secrets of the Company, (b) result from work performed by me for the Company, or (c) relate to the Company's business or current or anticipated research and development (""), will be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. I agree to assign, and do hereby assign, to the Company any and all rights that I may have in any such Company Inventions and in any Intellectual Property Rights therein or related thereto. Attached hereto as is a list describing all inventions, original works of authorship, developments and trade secrets which were made by me (including patents, original works of authorship and developments I worked on with a prior employer) prior to the date of this Agreement, which belong to me (or belong to me and third parties) and which are not assigned to the Company (""). If disclosure of any Prior Inventions would cause me to violate any prior confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am not to list such Prior Inventions in but should only disclose a cursory name for each such invention, the owners of that invention and why full disclosure has not been made. If no such list is attached, it is because there are no Prior Inventions. I acknowledge and agree that if I use any of my Prior Inventions in the scope of my employment, or include them in any product or service of the Company, I hereby grant to the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, world-wide, royalty-free license to use, disclose, make, have made, sell, import, copy, distribute, modify and create works based on, perform or display such Prior Inventions and to sublicense third parties with the same rights. I will not use or disclose any Prior Inventions in the scope of my employment at the Company if such use or disclosure would cause me to violate any obligations to any third party.
Company Inventions
Exhibit A
Prior Inventions
Exhibit A
     7. I also waive and agree never to assert any "" I might have in or with respect to any Company Invention even after I leave the Company. "Moral Rights" means any right to claim authorship of any Company Invention, to object to or prevent modification or destruction of any Company Invention, or to withdraw from circulation or to control the publication or distribution of any Company Invention, and any similar right existing under the judicial or statutory law of any country or treaty.
Moral Rights
     8. I agree to assist the Company in every proper way to obtain and enforce the Intellectual Property Rights and other legal protections for the Company Inventions in any and all countries. I will sign documents that the Company may reasonably request for use in obtaining and enforcing such protection. My obligations under this paragraph will continue even after I leave the Company, provided the Company will reimburse me at a reasonable rate after I leave the Company for time or expenses actually spent by me on its behalf. I appoint the Secretary of the Company as my attorney-in-fact to execute documents on my behalf for the purposes set forth in this paragraph.
     9. I understand that my employment with the Company requires my undivided attention and effort. As a result, during my employment, I will not, without the company's express written consent, engage in any other employment or business that (i) directly competes with the current or future business of the Company; (ii) uses any Company information, equipment, supplies, facilities or materials; or (iii) otherwise conflicts with the Company's business interest and causes a disruption of its operations.
 
     10. I understand that during and after the termination of my employment with Company, I will not directly or indirectly solicit or otherwise take away customers or suppliers of the Company if, in so doing, I access, use or disclose any Proprietary Information belonging to the Company. I acknowledge and agree that the names and addresses of the Company's customers and suppliers, and all other confidential information related to them, including but not limited to their buying and selling habits and special needs, that was first obtained by, or first disclosed to me during my employment with the Company or Digital Insight Corporation, constitute trade secrets of the Company.
     11. During my employment with the Company and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, I will not directly or indirectly solicit away employees or consultants of the Company for my own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or entity.
     12. I hereby authorize the Company to use, reuse, and grant others the right to use and reuse, both during and after my employment, my name, photograph, likeness (including caricature), voice, and biographical information, and any reproduction or simulation thereof, in any form of media or technology now known or hereafter developed (including, but not limited to, film, video and digital or other electronic media) in connection with the Company's business, including any promotion, marketing or advertising of the Company or its products or services which was obtained by the Company during my employment with the Company.
     13. I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement and my responsibilities as an employee of the Company will not breach any invention assignment, proprietary information, nonsolicitation, noncompetition, or other agreement or obligation with any former employer or other party. I also represent that I will not bring with me to the Company or use in the performance of my responsibilities for the Company any property or materials or trade secrets of a former employer or third party that are not generally available to the public or would not have been legally transferred to the Company. In the event I leave the Company, I hereby grant consent to notification by the Company to my new employer about my rights and obligations under this Agreement.
     14. I understand that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by me will likely result in irreparable harm and the Company will be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement and shall have the right to recover the reasonable attorney's fees and court costs expended in connection with any litigation instituted to enforce this Agreement.
     15. This Agreement will be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to or application of choice of law rules or principles. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found by a court or other competent tribunal to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will not be voided but enforced to the maximum extent allowed, and the remainder of the provision will remain in full force and effect. If such clause or provision cannot be so enforced, such provision shall be stricken from this Agreement and the remainder of this Agreement shall be enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable clause or provision had (to the extent not enforceable) never been contained in this Agreement.
 
     16. I have been notified and understand that the provisions of Sections 6 and 7 of this Agreement do not apply to any Company Inventions that qualify fully under the provisions of Section 2870 of the California Labor Code, which states as follows:
ANY PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES THAT AN EMPLOYEE SHALL ASSIGN, OR OFFER TO ASSIGN, ANY OF HIS OR HER RIGHTS IN AN INVENTION TO HIS OR HER EMPLOYER SHALL NOT APPLY TO AN INVENTION THAT THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPED ENTIRELY ON HIS OR HER OWN TIME WITHOUT USING THE EMPLOYER'S EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES, FACILITIES, OR TRADE SECRET INFORMATION EXCEPT FOR THOSE INVENTIONS THAT EITHER: (1) RELATE AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OR REDUCTION TO PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION TO THE EMPLOYER'S BUSINESS, OR ACTUALLY OR DEMONSTRABLY ANTICIPATED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPLOYER, OR (2) RESULT FROM ANY WORK PERFORMED BY THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE EMPLOYER. TO THE EXTENT A PROVISION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT PURPORTS TO REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO ASSIGN AN INVENTION OTHERWISE EXCLUDED FROM BEING REQUIRED TO BE ASSIGNED UNDER CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2870(a), THE PROVISION IS AGAINST THE PUBLIC POLICY OF THIS STATE AND IS UNENFORCEABLE.
     17. This Agreement, the Non-Competition Agreement between me and the Company ("the Non-Competition Agreement") and any documents referred to herein, constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between or among the parties hereto with respect to the specific subject matter hereof. Should there be any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Non-Competition Agreement, I understand that those provisions most protective of the Company's interests will control.
     18. This Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement executed by each of the parties hereto. No amendment of or waiver of, or modification of any obligation under this Agreement will be enforceable unless set forth in a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Any amendment effected in accordance with this section will be binding upon all parties hereto and each of their respective successors and assigns. No delay or failure to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of that provision as to that or any other instance. No waiver granted under this Agreement as to any one provision herein shall constitute a subsequent waiver of such provision or of any other provision herein, nor shall it constitute the waiver of any performance other than the actual performance specifically waived.
     19. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of their respective successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. The Company may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. No other party to this Agreement may assign, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company.
 
     20. I understand that this Agreement does not constitute an employment contract or obligate the Company to employ me for any period of time. I understand that my employment with the Company is at will and may be terminated by the Company at any time and for any reason or no reason, with or without notice and with or without cause. I acknowledge that any statements or representations to the contrary are ineffective, unless put into a writing signed by the Company. I further acknowledge that my participation in any stock option or benefit program is not to be construed as any assurance of continuing employment for any particular period of time.
 
     21. This Agreement will be effective as of the first day of my employment by the Company, or upon disclosure of covered Company Proprietary Information should that disclosure occur prior to the first day of my employment, or upon the date of my signature below, whichever date occurs first.

EXHIBIT 99.03
The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at October 31, 2006 and unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 and the three months ended October 31, 2006 are based on the historical financial statements of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") and Digital Insight Corporation ("Digital Insight") after giving effect to Intuit's acquisition of Digital Insight (the "Acquisition") using the purchase method of accounting and Intuit's borrowing of $1.0 billion under an unsecured bridge credit facility (the "Borrowings").
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at October 31, 2006 is presented as if the Acquisition and the Borrowings occurred on October 31, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations are presented as if the Acquisition and the Borrowings had taken place on August 1, 2005. For additional information, please see the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements ("pro forma financial statements").
Intuit and Digital Insight had different fiscal year ends. Intuit's fiscal year end is July 31 while Digital Insight's fiscal year end was December 31. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet combines Intuit's historical consolidated balance sheet at October 31, 2006 with Digital Insight's historical consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 combines Intuit's historical consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months then ended with Digital Insight's historical consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2006 combines Intuit's historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months then ended with Digital Insight's historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2006.
The Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price presented in the accompanying pro forma financial statements was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill.
The pro forma financial statements have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated financial position or results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had Intuit and Digital Insight been a combined company during the respective periods presented and had the Borrowings been completed at the specified times. The purchase price allocation and valuation of intangible assets in these financial statements are preliminary and could differ significantly from the final purchase price allocation. The pro forma financial statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with Intuit's historical consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 filed on September 15, 2006 and in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended October 31, 2006 filed on December 1, 2006, as well as Digital Insight's historical consolidated financial statements included in its Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 filed on March 16, 2006 and in its Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 filed on November 9, 2006.
 
 
 
 
1. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation
Intuit acquired Digital Insight on February 6, 2007 pursuant to a definitive merger agreement dated November 29, 2006 ("the Merger Agreement"). Digital Insight is a provider of outsourced online banking applications and services to banks, credit unions and savings and loan associations, and will be part of a separate reportable segment beginning in Intuit's quarter that ends on April 30, 2007.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Intuit paid a cash amount of $39.00 per share for each outstanding share of Digital Insight common stock and assumed options to purchase Digital Insight common stock, which were converted as of the acquisition date into options to purchase approximately 1.5 million shares of Intuit common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at October 31, 2006 and the unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 and for the three months ended October 31, 2006 are based on the historical financial statements of Intuit and Digital Insight after giving effect to Intuit's acquisition of Digital Insight, Intuit's borrowing of $1.0 billion (see Note 3) and the assumptions and adjustments described in these notes. We have eliminated all significant balances and transactions between Intuit and Digital Insight in these pro forma financial statements. See Note 5.
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet at October 31, 2006 is presented as if the Acquisition and the Borrowings occurred on October 31, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations are presented as if the Acquisition and the Borrowings had taken place on August 1, 2005.
Intuit and Digital Insight had different fiscal year ends. Intuit's fiscal year end is July 31 while Digital Insight's fiscal year end was December 31. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet combines Intuit's historical consolidated balance sheet at October 31, 2006 with Digital Insight's historical consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 combines Intuit's historical consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months then ended with Digital Insight's historical consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2006. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2006 combines Intuit's historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months then ended with Digital Insight's historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2006.
Certain reclassification adjustments have been made in the presentation of Digital Insight's historical amounts to conform to Intuit's presentation. See Note 6. No pro forma adjustments were made to conform Digital Insight's accounting policies to Intuit's accounting policies as the impact of policy differences on the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements was not material.
2. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation
The total purchase price of the Acquisition was as follows:
      
The fair value of the assumed options was determined using a lattice-binomial model. The use of the lattice-binomial model and the method of determining the variables used in that model was consistent with Intuit's valuation of stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123(R),
 
as described in Intuit's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2006 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
"Share-Based Payment,"
The acquisition-related transaction costs consist of costs related to the close of the transaction, including legal, accounting, and investment banking fees.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price as shown in the table above is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The purchase price was allocated using the information currently available, and we may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation after obtaining more information regarding, among other things, asset valuations, liabilities assumed, and revisions of preliminary estimates. The purchase price allocation may not be finalized until fiscal 2008.
The excess of the purchase price over the net of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is as follows:
      
Net tangible assets were approximately $116 million. The values of accumulated implementation costs, property and equipment and deferred revenue were based on fair values. All other tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were valued at their respective carrying amounts, which approximated fair value. See further discussion of these purchase accounting adjustments in Note 5.
Intangible assets of approximately $294 million consisted of customer relationships (including existing contractual relationships), developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements. The customer relationships intangible assets of approximately $139 million relate to Digital Insight's ability to sell existing, in process and future versions of its products to its existing customers. The fair value of intangible assets was based on a financial valuation forecast using income approaches. A rate of approximately 13% was used to discount net cash flows to their present value. The discount rate used was equal to the estimated rate of return for the Acquisition. The following table presents the details of the identifiable intangible assets acquired.
      
Net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $77 million include tax effects of fair value adjustments primarily related to amortizable intangible assets.
Goodwill of approximately $1.0 billion represents the excess of the purchase price over the net of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Digital Insight. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment.
 
3. Borrowings
In connection with the Acquisition, on January 31, 2007 Intuit entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured bridge credit facility with two institutional lenders that expires on February 5, 2008. At our election, advances under this bridge facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to Citibank's base rate plus 0.05% or the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.45%. The instruments governing the bridge credit facility include covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of not greater than three to one and a ratio of annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than three-to-one. Intuit is in compliance with these covenants at the date of this report. On February 6, 2007 Intuit borrowed the entire $1.0 billion available under the bridge credit facility to pay a portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition. Subject to market conditions, Intuit intends to refinance the bridge credit facility with longer-term non-convertible debt.
For purposes of these pro forma combined condensed financial statements, pro forma interest expense was calculated using the bridge credit facility interest rate in effect at February 6, 2007. At this date, the interest rate was 5.77%.
4. Restructuring Costs Related to Post-Merger Activities
As a result of the Acquisition, Intuit expects to incur restructuring costs during the year commencing with the closing of the Acquisition. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No 95-3, these costs will be recognized as assumed liabilities with a resulting increase in goodwill. The restructuring costs will primarily consist of severance and relocation payments associated with Digital Insight employees and costs to vacate certain Digital Insight facilities that existed prior to the closing of the Acquisition. Intuit may also incur costs associated with canceling or reducing Digital Insight's existing purchase commitments for materials, equipment and services. These charges and related impact are not reflected in these pro forma financial statements since management, with approval from Intuit's Board of Directors, is continuing to assess and formulate the restructuring plan and the timing and financial impact cannot yet be fully determined.

5. Pro Forma Adjustments
The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements have been prepared as if the Acquisition had been completed on October 31, 2006 for balance sheet purposes and on August 1, 2005 for statement of operations purposes and reflect the following pro forma adjustments:
(a) To adjust investments as follows:
      
(b) To eliminate transactions and balances between Intuit and Digital Insight.
(c) To record the deferred tax effects of differences between book and tax bases at the combined federal and state (net of the federal deduction benefit) statutory rate of 40%, to record certain deferred tax assets generated as a result of change in control related equity awards, and to reclassify certain deferred tax assets that Intuit expects to utilize as a result of the Acquisition. The deferred tax effects of differences between book and tax bases relate primarily to amortizable intangible assets.
(d) To eliminate short-term accumulated implementation costs. These deferred implementation costs were being recognized ratably over the estimated term of Digital Insight's customer relationships. The deferred revenue related to these accumulated costs was also eliminated as they were deemed to have no future value.
 
(e) To record the difference between the fair value and historical carrying value of Digital Insight's property and equipment.
(f) To eliminate Digital Insight's historical goodwill and record the goodwill resulting from the Acquisition as follows:
      
(g) To eliminate Digital Insight's historical intangible assets and record the fair value of intangible assets acquired as follows:
      
(h) To adjust other assets as follows:
      
(i) To record Intuit's borrowing of $1.0 billion under an unsecured bridge credit facility. See Note 3.
(j) To adjust Digital Insight's deferred revenue to fair value, representing the legal performance obligations under Digital Insight's existing contracts. The fair value of deferred revenue is equal to the direct cost of fulfilling these obligations plus a reasonable profit.
(k) To adjust other accrued liabilities for acquisition-related transaction costs.
(l) To adjust stockholders' equity as follows:
 
(m) To adjust cost of revenue as follows:
      
(n) To record amortization of the developed technology intangible assets.
(o) To adjust selling and marketing expenses as follows:
      
(p) To adjust research and development expenses as follows:
      
(q) To adjust general and administrative expenses as follows:
      
 
(r) To record amortization of the acquired intangible assets and to eliminate the historical amortization from Digital Insight as follows:
      
(s) To record interest expense associated with the Borrowings. See Note 3 for further discussion of the assumptions used to calculate the pro forma interest expense adjustment.
(t) To adjust interest income by applying the average rate of return for the respective periods to the assumed net decrease in Intuit's investments balance of approximately $319 million used to fund a portion of the Acquisition.
(u) To adjust the tax provision to reflect the effect of the pro forma adjustments at the combined federal and state (net of the federal deduction benefit) statutory tax rate of 40%, including giving effect to the consequences of adjustments that relate to nontaxable income or nondeductible expense. Digital Insight had no tax basis in the impaired goodwill; therefore, the pro forma reversal of that expense had no related tax effect.
(v) We include stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are less than the average market price for our common stock in the calculation of diluted net income per share using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options, the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that will be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The pro forma diluted shares used in the calculation of pro forma diluted net income per share increased by approximately 250,000 shares compared with historical diluted shares for the twelve months ended July 31, 2006 as a result of Intuit's assumption of Digital Insight stock options.
(w) As a result of the Acquisition, the value of Digital Insight's goodwill is adjusted to fair value as of the beginning of the periods presented. Consequently, this adjustment is to eliminate the impairment expense related to the historical goodwill.
6. Reclassifications (in thousands)
The following reclassifications have been made in the presentation of Digital Insight's historical financial statements to conform to Intuit's presentation.

Exhibit 99.01
- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its second-quarter 2007 revenue increased 3 percent year-over-year to $763 million, in line with expectations. For the first six months of the fiscal year, the company reported revenue growth of 8 percent.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 22, 2007
     Growth in the quarter was driven by strong sales in Consumer Tax, which were up 18 percent over the year-ago period, and Payroll and Payments segment, which was up 15 percent year-over-year. This growth was offset partly by revenue shifts in QuickBooks and Pro Tax, which moved about $45 million in revenue from the second quarter to the first and third quarters, compared to last year.
     "We are pleased with the early results of TurboTax and the continued strength in our Payroll and Payments segment," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "We are also excited by the recent acquisition of Digital Insight, which will provide a third platform for growth as we go forward."
Second-Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights
     Intuit posted GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) diluted net income of $145 million in the quarter versus diluted net income of $183 million in the second quarter of 2006. This represents diluted net income of $0.40 per share versus diluted net income of $0.50 per share in the year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2006 results
 
Intuit Earnings Q207 Page 2
included $28 million, or 7 cents per share, from discontinued operations. Intuit posted non-GAAP diluted net income of $161 million, or $0.45 per share versus $174 million, or $0.48 per share in the second quarter of 2006.
Second-Quarter 2007 Business Segment Results
Forward-looking Guidance
     Forward-looking guidance has been adjusted to reflect the acquisition of Digital Insight, the disposition of certain fully outsourced payroll assets, and a lower effective tax rate. For fiscal 2007 Intuit now expects:
     Intuit also adjusted its previously given third quarter, fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2007 guidance for revenue and earnings per share, details of which are available on Intuit's Web site at www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors/earnings/2007.

This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it. A copy of the press release filed by Intuit on February 22, 2007 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2007 and beyond; expectations of future growth, including growth of the Digital Insight business; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively effect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any
 
Intuit Earnings Q207 Page 4
failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 22, 2007, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated February 22, 2007 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables B and E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

If an event of default resulting from specified events involving the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization has occurred and is continuing, the Indenture provides that the entire principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest of the Notes outstanding will automatically become due immediately and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder.

The Securities will be issued pursuant to an Indenture to be dated as of March 7, 2007 (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").
     The Company hereby confirms its agreement with the several Underwriters concerning the purchase and sale of the Securities, as follows:
     1. .

The Company has also filed, or proposes to file, with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act a prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities (the "Prospectus Supplement"). The registration statement, as amended at the date of this Agreement, including the information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness ("Rule 430 Information"), is referred to herein as the "Registration
Registration Statement
 
Statement"; and as used herein, the term "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus as supplemented by the prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities in the form first used (or made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Securities and the term "Preliminary Prospectus" means the preliminary prospectus supplement specifically relating to the Securities together with the Basic Prospectus. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. Any reference in this Agreement to the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as the case may be, and any reference to "amend," "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to the Registration Statement, any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "Exchange Act") that are deemed to be incorporated by reference therein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" means the effective date of the Registration Statement with respect to the offering of Securities, as determined for the Company pursuant to Section 11 of the Securities Act and Item 512 of Regulation S-K, as applicable.
     At or prior to the time when sales of the Securities were first made (the "Time of Sale"), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively, the "Time of Sale Information"): a Preliminary Prospectus dated March 7, 2007, and each "free-writing prospectus" (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex B hereto.
     2. .

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any of the Securities except upon payment for all the Securities to be purchased as provided herein.
Purchase of the Securities by the Underwriters
     (b) The Company understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public offering of the Securities as soon after the effectiveness of this Agreement as in the judgment of the Representatives is advisable, and initially to offer the Securities on the terms set forth in the Prospectus. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell Securities to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter
 
and that any such affiliate may offer and sell Securities purchased by it to or through any Underwriter.
     (c) Payment for and delivery of the Securities will be made at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025 at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on March 12, 2007, or at such other time or place on the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing.

The Global Notes will be made available for inspection by the Representatives not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the business day prior to the Closing Date.
     (e) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are acting solely in the capacity of an arm's length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Underwriters shall have no responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each of clauses (i) and (ii) except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any Time of Sale Information, it being understood and agreed that the only such information consists of the following: the third and sixth full paragraphs under the heading "Underwriters" in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information and the Prospectus.
Indemnification of the Company.
     (c) If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in writing; that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and , , that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel related to such proceeding as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless: (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal

defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of the Company shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 45 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have received notice of the terms of such settlement at least 5 days prior to such settlement being entered into and (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company on
Contribution.
 
the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company from the sale of the Securities and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
     (e) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Securities exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.
Limitation on Liability.

amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters.

necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (other than the financial statements and schedules and other financial and related statistical data contained therein and that part of the Registration Statement that constitutes the Statement of Eligibility of the Trustee on Form T-1 under the Trust Indenture Act, as to which such counsel need express no opinion).
     In rendering such opinion, such counsel may rely as to matters of fact on certificates of responsible officers of the Company and public officials that are furnished to the Underwriters.

ATTEST:
(SEAL)
 
     This is one of the Securities of the series designated herein referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
     This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the ""), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as of March 7, 2007 (herein called the "" which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), between the Company and The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the "" which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the Indenture, the Officers' Certificate dated March 12, 2007, pursuant to Sections 1.02 and 3.01 of the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face hereof.
Securities
Indenture,
Trustee,
     The Securities of this series are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the election of the Company upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice by mail, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of: (1) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be redeemed, and (2) the sum of the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments (as defined below), plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Redemption Date. In determining the present values of the Remaining Scheduled Payments, the Company will discount such payments to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 0.15% (15 basis points).
     "" means, with respect to any Security to be redeemed, the remaining scheduled payments of the principal thereof and interest thereon that would be due after the related Redemption Date but for such redemption; provided, however, that, if such Redemption Date is not an Interest Payment Date with respect to such Security, the amount of the next scheduled interest payment thereon will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued thereon to such Redemption Date.
Remaining Scheduled Payments
     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
     Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities, or portions thereof, called for redemption.
     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
 
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
     As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Securities of this series at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

The applicable interest rate will be increased by 0.05% for any period in which the aggregate principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the Facility exceeds $250 million.
     The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of liens, and limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by Intuit's subsidiaries.

The Borrower hereby agrees to each such participation. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Agent, for the account of such Issuing Bank, such Lender's Ratable Share of each drawing made under a Letter of Credit funded by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date made, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, which amount will be advanced, and deemed to be an Advance to the Borrower hereunder, regardless of the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.02.

Each Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice of each drawing under any Letter of Credit issued by it to the Borrower and the Agent. Upon written demand by such Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Agent and the Borrower, each Lender shall pay to the Agent such Lender's Ratable Share of such outstanding Advance pursuant to Section 2.03(b).

Promptly after receipt thereof, the Agent shall transfer such funds to such Issuing Bank. Each Lender agrees to fund its Ratable Share of an outstanding Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by such Issuing Bank, that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by any such Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account of such Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of any such Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute an Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Advance made by such Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Agent
          We have acted as counsel for the Borrower in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement.
          In rendering this opinion, we have examined such matters of law as we considered necessary for the purpose of rendering this opinion. As to matters of fact material to the opinions expressed herein, we have relied solely upon the representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in, and made by Borrower pursuant to, the Management Certificate (defined on ) and upon our examination of the documents identified on (collectively, ""). We have not examined, and we express no opinion with respect to, any documents other than those described on or made any independent factual investigation. Except as described on , bring-down certificates, telegrams or telephonic advice of the public officials referred to on were not obtained as of the date hereof. Except as described on , we have not caused the search of any record of any governmental agency or third party.

Exhibit A
          In our examination of documents, we have assumed the current accuracy and completeness of (a) the information obtained from public officials and records included in the documents identified on and (b) the representations and warranties made by representatives of Borrower to us, including, without limitation, those set forth in the Management Certificate. We have also assumed that all the representations and warranties made by Borrower in, or pursuant to, the Credit Agreement are true and complete as to factual matters in all material respects. We have made no attempt to verify the accuracy of any of such information, representations or warranties or to determine the existence or non-existence of any factual matters other than those described above.
Exhibit A
          In our examination of documents for purposes of this opinion, we have assumed, and express no opinion as to, the genuineness of all signatures on original documents, the authenticity and completeness of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals and completeness of all documents submitted to us as copies, the lack of any undisclosed termination, modification, waiver or amendment to any document reviewed by us, the legal competence and capacity of all persons or entities (other than the Borrower) executing the same and (except with respect to due authorization of the Credit Agreement and the Notes by Borrower) the due authorization, execution and delivery of all documents where due authorization, execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness thereof.
 
          For the purposes of this opinion, we have also assumed, without independent investigation, that: (a) the Credit Agreement and the Notes (together with the related commitment letter) reflect the complete understanding and agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter thereof; (b) the Credit Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Lenders, enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms; and (c) Borrower is not insolvent and by executing and delivering the Credit Agreement and the Notes will not become insolvent and has not intended to incur, and will not have believed that it has incurred, debts beyond its ability to pay them as they mature.
          As used in this opinion, the phrases "to our knowledge," "we are not aware," "known to us" or "to our actual knowledge" or words of similar import refer only to the current actual knowledge of the attorneys within this firm representing Borrower in connection with the execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and indicate that we have not undertaken any independent investigation with respect to the statements being qualified by such knowledge limitation other than our examination of the Reviewed Documents.
          We do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any information, including, but not limited to, financial information, furnished to you by Borrower (or any of its agents or representatives) concerning the business, assets, operations, financial condition or affairs of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any other information furnished to you by Borrower or any of its agents or representatives.
          Where statements in this opinion are qualified by the term "," or "" those statements involve judgments and opinions as to the materiality or lack of materiality of certain matters upon the financial condition or operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, which judgments and opinions are entirely those of Borrower and its officers, after having been advised by us as to the legal effect and consequences of such matters.

     (b) the effect of general principles of equity, including but not limited to judicial decisions holding that certain provisions are unenforceable when their enforcement would violate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable or involve undue delay, whether or not such principles or decisions have been codified by statute, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, unconscionability and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;
     (c) the effect of limitations imposed by reason of generally applicable public policy principles or considerations or limitations imposed by or resulting from the exercise by any court of its discretion;

     (l) the effect of equitable principles on the enforceability of any provision in the Credit Agreement or the Notes that permits or authorizes the Agent or the Lenders to exercise remedies or impose penalties or an increase in interest rate for late payment or other default if it is determined that the default is not material, the remedies or penalties bear no reasonable relation to the damage suffered by the Agent or the Lenders as a result of the default or it cannot be demonstrated that the enforcement of the remedies or penalties is reasonably necessary for the protection of the Agent or the Lenders;

          With respect to our opinion in paragraph 2 below, we have relied solely upon Borrower's certification in the Management Certificate identifying those agreements of Borrower that Borrower considers to be material with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes and the transactions contemplated to be carried out in accordance with and pursuant to the Credit Agreement and copies, supplied to us by Borrower, of such Material Agreements that are expressly listed and identified as "Material Agreements" on hereto and in the Management Certificate.

          With respect to our opinion in paragraph 3 below, we note that the Credit Agreement and/or the Notes may be required to be filed and/or disclosed in a current report on Form 8-K by Borrower with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     We are admitted to practice law in the State of California and in the State of New York. The opinions expressed herein are limited to the existing internal laws of the State of California, the existing laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law as in effect on the date hereof (the ""), and the existing federal laws of the United States of America, assuming that such laws apply to the matters expressed herein. To the extent that any of the Reviewed Documents (other than the Credit Agreement and the Notes) are governed by the laws of any jurisdiction other than the States of California or New York, or the United States federal law as described above, we have assumed with your permission that those laws are the same as the relevant laws of the State of California and our opinion relating to those documents is based solely upon the apparent meaning of the language, without regard to interpretation or construction that might be indicated by the laws governing those agreements. Our opinion is limited to such California and New York state and United States federal statutes, laws, rules or regulations, and provisions of the DGCL, as in our experience are of general application to transactions of the sort contemplated by the Credit Agreement.
DGCL
          With respect to our enforceability opinion in paragraph 4 below, our opinion is limited to the existing laws of the State of New York. With respect to the Credit Agreement and the Notes, we have assumed that in a proceeding outside of New York that the choice of New York state law would be given effect and would exclusively apply to and govern the Credit Agreement.
          In rendering the opinions below, we are opining only as to the specific legal issues expressly set forth therein, and no opinion shall be inferred as to any other matter or matters.
          Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and subject to all of the assumptions, qualifications, exceptions and limitations contained herein, we are of the following opinion:
     1. The Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
     2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, are within the Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Borrower's Board of Directors and, where required, its shareholders, and do not (i) violate the terms of the Charter or the By-laws, (ii) violate any California State, New York State or United States federal law, rule or regulation applicable to the Borrower (including, without limitation, Regulation X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or (iii) result in the breach of any Material Agreement. The Credit Agreement and the Notes have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Borrower.
     3. No authorization, approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any California State, New York State, or United States federal, governmental authority or regulatory body, or pursuant to the DGCL to any governmental authority or regulatory body, is required for the due execution, delivery and performance, as of the date hereof, by the Borrower of the Credit Agreement and the Notes.
     4. The Credit Agreement is, and after giving effect to the initial Borrowing, the Notes will be, legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.
          In rendering the opinions above, we are opining only as to the specific legal issues expressly set forth herein, and no opinion shall be inferred as to other matters. This opinion is intended solely for the use of the Lenders and the Agent for the purpose of the above transaction, and is not to be relied upon for any other purpose or by any other person or entity, without our prior written consent, except that a copy of this opinion may be delivered by any Lender to any person or entity that is a permitted Assignee of a Lender, and becomes a Lender in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.

Exhibit 99.01
 Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced its third-quarter 2007 revenue increased 21 percent over the year-ago quarter to $1.15 billion. This marks the first time Intuit revenue has exceeded $1 billion in a quarter.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  May 17, 2007
     Growth was driven by a strong tax season, excellent performance in QuickBooks and the acquisition of Digital Insight to create a Financial Institutions segment. Revenue for the first nine months of the fiscal year grew 14 percent.
     "We had great results from all of our businesses this quarter," said Steve Bennett, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Our two biggest growth engines, Tax and Small Business, continue to perform very well and our newest growth engine, Financial Institutions, is also making a significant contribution. We're on track for another year of double-digit revenue and earnings growth."
Third-Quarter 2007 Financial Highlights
     Intuit posted GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) net income of $367 million in the quarter compared to $299 million in the third quarter of 2006. This represents diluted net income per share of $1.04 compared to diluted net income per share of $0.84 in the year-ago quarter. Intuit posted non-GAAP net income of $399 million, or $1.13 per share versus $318 million, or $0.89 per share in the third quarter of 2006.

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2007 and beyond; expectations of double-digit revenue and earnings growth; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 17, 2007, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated May 17, 2007 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables B and E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure. All share and per share figures in this Table B retroactively reflect our July 2006 two-for-one common stock split.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding Table B for more information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

Approval of Fiscal Year 2007 Bonus Awards and Fiscal 2008 Base Salaries for Senior Executives
Several of the senior executive officers of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") are eligible to receive an annual performance incentive payment for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2007 ("Fiscal 2007") under Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"), because the performance goals established by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") for Fiscal 2007 were achieved. The senior executives eligible for a bonus under the SEIP are: Stephen M. Bennett, Robert B. Henske, Alexander M. Lintner, Kiran M. Patel, and Brad D. Smith. At meetings held on July 24 and July 25, 2007, the Committee determined the amounts of annual performance bonuses under the SEIP based on the Committee's review with management of the performance of each of the eligible executive officers.
The Committee also approved the annual performance bonuses payable to our other officers and employees, including bonuses for Scott D. Cook, William V. Campbell and Richard William Ihrie, under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2007. The Fiscal 2007 bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on its review with management of the performance of each of these individuals.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the Fiscal 2007 bonus and the Fiscal 2008 annual base salary approved for each person designated as a "named executive officer" in our 2006 annual proxy statement, and Scott D. Cook and William V. Campbell, members of Intuit's Board of Directors who are also employees.
Funding of 2007 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 24, 2007, the Committee approved funding for the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees (other than officers eligible to receive bonuses under the SEIP) under the IPI for Fiscal 2007 in

the aggregate amount of $101,000,000. A majority of Intuit's full time employees are eligible for annual performance bonus awards under the IPI for Fiscal 2007.
Approval of 2008 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
     On July 24, 2007, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal 2008, a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal 2008 will be based upon the employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal 2008, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal 2008 based on overall Company performance. A copy of the IPI for fiscal 2008 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01.

Intuit Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Page 5
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2008 and beyond; and all of the statements under the headings "Forward-Looking Guidance for Fiscal 2008," "Fiscal 2008 Business Segment Guidance" and "First Quarter 2008 Guidance."
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2006 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 22, 2007, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated August 22, 2007 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Tables B and E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding Table B for more information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 

 
Exhibit 99.02
     Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced that Steve Bennett, current president and chief executive officer, will step down at the end of December 2007. Intuit's board of directors has appointed Brad Smith, current senior vice president and general manager of Intuit's Small Business Division, to succeed him effective Jan. 1.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Aug. 22, 2007 
     "Steve Bennett has been an outstanding leader for Intuit over the last eight seasons," said Bill Campbell, chairman of Intuit's board of directors. "He has consistently delivered great results and he has built enduring pillars of growth that will take this company into the future."
     Under Bennett, the company has nearly tripled its revenue with double-digit growth every year and quadrupled its earnings. Bennett, 53, will remain an Intuit board member. In addition, he'll serve as a consultant to the leadership team through July 2008, when the company's fiscal year ends.
     "I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished since I joined Intuit in 2000," Bennett said. "Now, with eight successful seasons under my belt, the company solidly positioned for the future, and a CEO successor ready to lead the company, it's the right time for me to take some time off and explore the next challenge in my life."

Smith to Take Reins in January
     Smith, 43, will continue in his current role leading Intuit's Small Business Division until the end of the year as both he and Bennett work closely to successfully complete the transition.
     "Steve has been a strong driver of our succession planning efforts at Intuit," Campbell said. "And through that process Brad clearly emerged as the right person to be Intuit's next CEO."
     "Having led each of our biggest businesses, Brad has a proven track record inside and outside of Intuit," Bennett said. "He has been instrumental in shaping the strategy. He has a strong and experienced management team in place. And he's ready to lead Intuit into the future. I look forward to working with him in his new role."
     Smith credited Bennett with helping prepare him for the CEO role.
     "I'm thrilled and honored to lead Intuit through the next chapter in its history," said Smith. "It's been a tremendous experience learning from Steve. Under his leadership, Intuit has consistently delivered fantastic results for employees, customers and shareholders. And we have a clear strategy in place that will guide us into the future."
     Smith was appointed to his Small Business Division role in May 2005. Previously, he was senior vice president and general manager of Intuit's Consumer Tax Group and, before that, vice president and general manager of the company's Accountant Central organization and the Intuit Developer Network.
     Before joining Intuit in February 2003, Smith was senior vice president of marketing and business development at ADP. He has also held various sales, marketing and general management positions with Pepsi, Seven-Up and Advo, Inc. Smith earned his master's degree in management from Aquinas College and a bachelor's in business administration from Marshall University.

ITEM 8.01     OTHER EVENTS
     In August 2007, Stephen M. Bennett, President and Chief Executive Officer of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit"), adopted stock trading plans related to the sale of approximately 290,000 shares of Intuit common stock that will vest or be issued in January 2008 and the sale of approximately 340,000 shares that will vest or be issued in July and August 2008. The actual number of shares to be sold under these plans may vary depending on the number of shares withheld to satisfy certain tax withholding obligations. Mr. Bennett also adopted a trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 1,600,000 shares issuable under an option granted in January 2000, which expires in March 2008. Pursuant to this plan, a brokerage firm may exercise Mr. Bennett's stock option and sell the issued shares before the expiration date of the option. The exercise and sale transactions under this plan will only be executed if the market price of Intuit stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock options.
     These plans are intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and each was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.

You will be expected to devote your full working time and attention to the business of Intuit and you will not render services to any other business without the Company's prior approval, or directly or indirectly, engage or participate in any business that is competitive in any manner with the business of Intuit.
We have all been impressed by your talents, energy and experience, and are excited about the prospect of you joining our team.
This offer will remain open until close of business, November 5, 2007. The terms of our offer are as follows:

You will be eligible to participate in Intuit's Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI"), a cash incentive compensation program. Your target percentage under the IPI will be 75% of your base salary. Payouts under the IPI are tied to the achievements of Intuit and individual performance and are made to individuals who are employed on the date the IPI payment is made. IPI payments are made once a year in late August or September. The actual amount of your award for fiscal year 2008 will be based on Intuit and individual performance; provided that you will be guaranteed a minimum bonus for fiscal year 2008 of $400,000 so long as you remain an employee of Intuit through the IPI payment date. IPI payments are made after deduction of required and customary federal and state income and payroll tax withholdings.
 
FIRST ANNIVERSARY BONUS
You will be paid a $200,000 bonus as soon as reasonably possible following the first anniversary of your Start Date.

(the "New Hire Option.") The New Hire Option will be granted to you on the seventh business day of the month following your Start Date. The exercise price per share will be equal to the closing price of Intuit's Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant. If, however, that is not a trading day, the exercise price per share will be the closing price on the last trading day preceding the date of grant. The New Hire Option will be subject to the terms of the conditions of your Stock Option Agreement and the Intuit Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. The New Hire Options will vest over three years with 33-1/3% of the option shares vesting twelve months from your Start Date, and an additional 2.778% of the option shares vesting monthly thereafter for the next two years, provided you remain continuously employed by Intuit Inc. through each of the vesting dates. The New Hire Option will have a maximum term of seven years.

Your New Hire Units and the issuance of the underlying Intuit Inc. Common Stock will be subject to the terms and conditions of your Stock Unit Agreement and the Intuit Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan.
NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN AND MANAGEMENT STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM
You will be eligible to enroll in the Intuit Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "NQDCP") and in the Management Stock Purchase Program (the "MSPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of those plans. The NQDCP allows you to defer a portion of your annual base salary and/or bonus. Deferrals occur pre-tax and are credited to your account under the NQDCP. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the NQDCP and the Internal Revenue Code, you will be able to elect to have your contributions credited with earnings pursuant to the investment alternatives offered under the NQDCP and elect when to take distribution of this contribution and any earnings credited thereon. Beginning in our 2009 fiscal year, you will be allowed to defer up to 15% of your annual IPI bonus under the MSPP.
 
This deferral will be converted into restricted stock units based on the fair market value of Intuit's common stock on the date such bonus is awarded. Intuit will grant an additional Stock Unit for every Stock Unit purchased through such deferral, up to set maximums. The Stock Units granted pursuant to the MSPP will be issued under Intuit's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth therein.
EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENT
As an SVP at Intuit, you will be subject to the Executive Stock Ownership Program, under which you are required to own 15,000 shares of Intuit stock prior to the fifth anniversary of your Start Date. If you would like more information regarding this program, please let me know.
PERFORMANCE/SALARY REVIEWS
Performance and salary reviews are conducted at least once per fiscal year and usually occur following the close of Intuit's fiscal year.
SEVERANCE
Upon termination of your employment with Intuit for any reason, you will receive payment for all unpaid salary to the date of your termination of employment; and your benefits will be continued under Intuit's then existing benefit plans and policies for so long as provided under the terms of such plans and policies and as required by applicable law. Pursuant to Intuit's executive vacation policy, as described further below, we will not accrue vacation for you and therefore you will not be eligible for payout of unused vacation upon your termination.
Under certain circumstances, you will also be entitled to receive severance benefits as set forth below, but you will not be entitled to any other compensation, award or damages with respect to your employment or termination. All severance benefits shall be paid in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations and other Treasury Department guidance thereunder as then in effect. If Intuit determines that any severance benefits to be provided to you are or may become subject to the additional tax under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code ("Section 409A Taxes") if provided at the time otherwise set forth below then such payments will be delayed until the date that is six months after date of your "separation from service" (as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Code) with the Company, or such shorter period that, as determined by Intuit, is sufficient to avoid the imposition of Section 409A Taxes.
 
If your severance and other benefits provided for in this Section constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and, but for this Section, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then your severance and other benefits under this paragraph will be payable, at your election, either in full or in such lesser amount as would result, after taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, in your receipt on an after-tax basis of the greater amount of severance and other benefits.
Nothing in this section changes the at will nature of your employment as described further below.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit on November 15, 2007 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2008 and beyond; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to ship and deliver products and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2007 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 15, 2007, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated November 15, 2007 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; CONPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
     At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") held on December 14, 2007, Intuit's stockholders approved the following matters:
     The amendments to the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and the adoption of the Senior Executive Incentive Plan were previously adopted by Intuit's Board of Directors, subject to the approval of stockholders, which was received on December 14, 2007.
     2005 Equity Incentive Plan: Employees of Intuit and its subsidiaries, non-employee directors of Intuit and consultants of Intuit and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). Awards under the Plan may be in the form of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards. In any fiscal year, no more than 50% of the shares subject to equity awards granted in such fiscal year may have an exercise price or purchase price per share that is less than fair market value on the applicable date of grant. So that awards may qualify under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which permits performance-based compensation meeting the requirements established by the IRS to be excluded from the limitation on deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain senior executives, the Plan limits awards to individual participants as follows: (1) No more than 6,000,000 shares may be made subject to awards granted to an employee in the year of his or her hire; and (2) No more than 4,000,000 shares may be made subject to awards granted to an employee in any other year. Stock options and stock appreciation rights will have a term no longer than seven years. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee may make the grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock bonus awards contingent upon continued employment with Intuit, the passage of time, or such performance criteria and the level of achievement versus such criteria as it deems appropriate. Repricing, or reducing the exercise price of a stock option or stock appreciation right without stockholder approval is prohibited. The Plan also prohibits the repurchase of any outstanding "underwater" option (an option with an exercise price greater than the then-current fair market value of the stock).
     Senior Executive Incentive Plan: The Senior Executive Incentive Plan (the "SEIP") is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"). Executive officers, as determined by Intuit's Compensation and Organizational Development Committee (the "CODC"), are eligible to participate in the SEIP. Generally, under Section 162(m), the federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid to Intuit's President and Chief Executive Officer and each of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (other than its Chief Financial Officer) may be limited to the extent that it exceeds $1,000,000 in any one year. Intuit can deduct compensation in excess of that amount if the compensation qualifies as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m). Subject to the terms of the SEIP, the CODC has the sole discretion to determine the key employees who will receive awards and the amounts, terms and conditions of each award. Under the SEIP, during any Intuit fiscal year no participant may receive an award of more than $5,000,000. Under the SEIP, the CODC will determine the fiscal year or other performance period for measuring actual performance (each a "Performance Period"). The CODC will establish for each Performance Period (a) the performance goals based on business criteria and the target levels of performance, and (b) a formula for calculating a participant's award based on actual performance compared to the pre-established performance goals. Performance goals will be based on one or more of the following business criteria: revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share, return on net assets, cash flow, stockholder return, return on investment, revenue growth, market share, strategic positioning, return on
Table of Contents
equity, new product releases and employee productivity and satisfaction metrics. The CODC may set performance periods and performance goals that differ from participant to participant. For example, the CODC may designate performance goals based on either Intuit-wide or business unit results, as appropriate for the participant's specific responsibilities. After the end of each Performance Period, the CODC will determine the extent to which the performance goals for each participant were achieved. The CODC will determine the actual award (if any) for each participant by the level of actual performance achieved. However, the CODC retains discretion to eliminate or reduce the actual award payable to any participant below that which otherwise would be payable under the applicable formula. Awards under the SEIP generally will be payable in cash after the end of the Performance Period during which the award was earned.
     The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual terms of each plan. Each plan is filed as an exhibit to this report. For additional information about the plans, refer to Proposals 3 and 4, on pages 43-48 and 50-51, respectively, of Intuit's 2007 proxy statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 1, 2007.

     B. The Committee may delegate its authority to grant and administer Awards to a separate committee; however, only the Committee may grant and administer Awards which are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m).
Only Senior Executives designated by the Committee as eligible may become Participants in the Plan.
     A. The Committee shall establish performance goals applicable to a particular fiscal year (or performance period) prior to its start, provided, however, that such goals may be established after the start of the fiscal year (or performance period) but while the outcome of the performance goal is substantially uncertain if such a method of establishing performance goals is permitted under proposed or final regulations issued under Code Section 162(m).
     B. Each performance goal applicable to a fiscal year (or performance period) shall be one or more of the following performance criteria, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, applied to either Intuit as a whole or to a business unit or subsidiary, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years' results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Committee::
 
     C. The Committee shall determine the target level of performance that must be achieved with respect to each criterion that is identified in a performance goal in order for a performance goal to be treated as attained.
     D. The Committee shall base performance goals on one or more of the foregoing business criteria. In the event performance goals are based on more than one business criterion, the Committee may determine to make Awards upon attainment of the performance goal relating to any one or more of such criteria, provided the performance goals, when established, are stated as alternatives to one another at the time the performance goal is established.
     E. As soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of each fiscal year (or performance period), the Committee shall certify, in writing, if and the extent to which the performance goal or goals have been satisfied as and to the extent required by Code Section 162(m).
     A. Awards may be made on the basis of Intuit and/or business unit performance goals and formulas determined by the Committee. During any Intuit fiscal year, no Participant shall receive an Award of more $5,000,000.
     B. The Committee, in its discretion, may reduce or eliminate a Participant's Award at any time before it is paid, whether or not calculated on the basis of pre-established performance goals or formulas.
     C. The payment of an Award requires that the Participant be an active employee and on Intuit's payroll on the day the Award is paid to receive any portion of the Award. The Committee may make exceptions to this requirement in the case of retirement, death or disability, or in the case of a corporate change in control as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
     D. Intuit shall withhold all applicable federal, state, local and foreign taxes required by law to be paid or withheld relating to the receipt or payment of any Award.
     A. The Plan shall become effective as of October 23, 2007, contingent upon stockholder approval of the Plan.
     B. Any rights of a Participant under the Plan shall not be assignable by such Participant, by operation of law or otherwise, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. No Participant may create a lien on any funds or rights to which he or she may have an interest under the Plan, or which is held by Intuit for the account of the Participant under the Plan.
     C. Participation in the Plan shall not give any Senior Executive any right to remain in Intuit's employ. Further, the adoption of this Plan shall not be deemed to give any Senior Executive or other individual the right to be selected as a Participant or to be granted an Award.
 
     D. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Intuit under this Plan, such rights shall be no greater than the rights of an unsecured creditor of Intuit's.
     E. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.
     F. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan (i) at any time and for any reason subject to stockholder approval and (ii) at any time and for any reason if and to the extent the Plan's qualification under Code Section 162(m) would not be adversely affected.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
     In December 2007, Scott D. Cook, founder, board member and Chairman of the Executive Committee of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit"), adopted a stock trading plan on behalf of his family trust to sell up to 2,000,000 shares of Intuit common stock and contribute up to 400,000 additional shares to the Scott Cook and Signe Ostby Charitable Foundation beginning in February 2008 and continuing through December 2008. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, Mr. Cook's family trust will sell 500,000 shares and contribute 100,000 shares to the charitable foundation each quarter.
     The Scott Cook and Signe Ostby Charitable Foundation also adopted a stock trading plan in December 2007 to sell the 400,000 shares of Intuit stock contributed by Mr. Cook's family trust during the same period.
     Each of these plans is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and each was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit on February 21, 2008 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's double-digit revenue growth and other future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2008 and beyond; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2007 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 21, 2008, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.
http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors
 
 
 
 
The accompanying press release dated February 21, 2008 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

Amendment to 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
     On April 23, 2008, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Intuit Inc.

     The Acquisition Committee was established in January 2008 to review and approve certain acquisition, divestiture and investment transactions proposed by the Company's management.
Acquisition Committee Annual Retainer
     On April 23, 2008, the Board approved an annual cash retainer of $15,000 for each member of the Company's Acquisition Committee, payable upon the same terms and conditions as other Board and Board Committee cash retainers.

In any fiscal year of the Company no more than fifty percent (50%) of the Shares subject to Awards granted in such fiscal year may have an Exercise Price or Purchase Price per Share that is less than Fair Market Value on the applicable date of grant. In order that ISOs may be granted under this Plan, no more than 46,000,000 shares shall be issued as ISOs. The Company may issue Shares which are authorized but unissued or treasury shares pursuant to the Awards granted under this Plan. At all times the Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding Options and SARs granted under the Plan and all other outstanding but unvested Awards granted under the Plan.
Number of Shares Available
          2.2 . If the number of outstanding Shares is changed by a stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification, extraordinary dividend of cash or stock or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, without consideration, then (a) the number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan and the limits that are set forth in Section 2.1; (b) the Exercise Prices of and number of Shares subject to outstanding Options and SARs; (c) the number of Shares subject to other outstanding Awards; (d) the 4,000,000 and 6,000,000 maximum number of shares that may be issued to an individual in any one calendar year set forth in Section 3; and (e) the number of Shares that are granted as Options to Non-Employee Directors as set forth in Section 10, will be proportionately adjusted, subject to any required action by the Board or the stockholders of the Company and compliance with applicable securities laws; provided that fractions of a Share will not be issued but will either be replaced by a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction of a Share or will be rounded up to the nearest whole Share, as determined by the Committee; and provided further that the Exercise Price of any Option may not be decreased to below the par value of the Shares.
Adjustment of Shares
     . ISOs may be granted only to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees) of the Company or of a Parent or Subsidiary. All other Awards may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees), non-employee directors and consultants of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary; provided that such consultants, contractors and advisors render bona fide services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction. The Committee (or its designee under 4.1(c)) will from time to time determine and designate among the eligible persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the Plan. A person may be granted more than one Award under the Plan. However, no person will be eligible to receive more than 4,000,000 Shares issuable under Awards granted in any calendar year, other than new employees of the Company or of a Parent or Subsidiary (including new employees who are also officers and directors of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary), who are eligible to receive up to a maximum of 6,000,000 Shares issuable under Awards granted in the calendar year in which they commence their employment.

4. ADMINISTRATION.
               4.1 . The Plan shall be administered by the Committee or by the Board acting as the Committee. Except for automatic grants to Non-Employee Directors pursuant to Section 10 hereof, and subject to the general purposes, terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee will have full power to implement and carry out the Plan. Without limiting the previous sentence, the Committee will have the authority to:
Committee Authority
              4.2 . Except for automatic grants to Non-Employee Directors pursuant to Section 10 hereof, any determination made by the Committee with respect to any Award shall be made in its sole discretion at the time of grant of the Award or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan or Award, at any later time, and such determination shall be final and binding on the Company and all persons having an interest in any Award under the Plan. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be submitted by the Participant or Company to the Committee for review. The resolution of such a dispute by the Committee shall be final and binding on the Company and Participant. The Committee may delegate to one or more Executive Officers, the authority to review and resolve disputes with respect to Awards held by Participants who are not Insiders, and such resolution shall be final and binding on the Company and Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, administration of the Plan shall at all times be limited by
Committee Interpretation and Discretion
 
the requirement that any administrative action or exercise of discretion shall be void (or suitably modified when possible) if necessary to avoid the application to any Participant of immediate taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code.
     . The Committee may grant Options to eligible persons and will determine (a) whether the Options will be ISOs or NQSOs; (b) the number of Shares subject to the Option, (c) the Exercise Price of the Option, (d) the period during which the Option may be exercised, and (e) all other terms and conditions of the Option, subject to the provisions of this Section 5 and the Plan. Options granted to Non-Employee Directors pursuant to Section 10 hereof shall be governed by that Section.
5. OPTIONS
          5.1 . Each Option granted under the Plan will be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement that will expressly identify the Option as an ISO or NQSO. Except as otherwise required by the terms of Options to Non-Employee Directors as provided in the terms of Section 10 hereof, the Stock Option Agreement will be substantially in a form and contain such provisions (which need not be the same for each Participant) that the Committee or an officer of the Company (pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) has from time to time approved, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Form of Option Grant
          5.2 . The date of grant of an Option will be the date on which the Committee makes the determination to grant the Option, unless a later date is otherwise specified by the Committee. The Stock Option Agreement, and a copy of the Plan and the current Prospectus for the Plan (plus any additional documents required to be delivered under applicable laws), will be delivered to the Participant within a reasonable time after the Option is granted. The Stock Option Agreement, Plan, the Prospectus and other documents may be delivered in any manner (including electronic distribution or posting) that meets applicable legal requirements.
Date of Grant
          5.3 . An Option will be exercisable within the times or upon the occurrence of events determined by the Committee and set forth in the Stock Option Agreement governing such Option, subject to the provisions of Section 5.6, and subject to Company policies established by the Committee (or by individuals to whom the Committee has delegated responsibility) from time to time with respect to vesting during leaves of absences. The Stock Option Agreement shall set forth the last date that the Option may be exercised (the ""); provided that no Option will be exercisable after the expiration of seven years from the date the Option is granted; and provided further that no ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will be exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date the Option is granted. The Committee also may provide for Options to become exercisable at one time or from time to time, periodically or otherwise (including, without limitation, upon the attainment during a Performance Period of performance goals based on Performance Factors), in such number of Shares or percentage of Shares subject to the Option as the Committee determines.
Exercise Period and Expiration Date
Expiration Date
          5.4 . The Exercise Price of an Option will be determined by the Committee when the Option is granted and, subject to the limit of Section 2.1, may be less than Fair Market Value (but not less than the par value of the Shares); provided that (i) the Exercise Price of an ISO will not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant and (ii) the Exercise Price of any ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant. Payment for the Shares purchased must be made in accordance with Section 11 of the Plan and the Stock Option Agreement.
Exercise Price
          5.5 . A Participant or Authorized Transferee may exercise Options by following the procedures established by the Company's Stock Administration Department, as communicated and made available to Participants through the stock pages on the Intuit Legal Department intranet web site, and/or through the Company's electronic mail system.
Procedures for Exercise
          5.6 .
Termination
     (a) . Any Option granted to a Participant will cease to vest on the Participant's Termination Date, if the Participant is Terminated for any reason other than "total disability" (as defined in this Section 5.6(a)) or death. Any Option granted to a Participant who is an employee who has been actively employed by the Company or any Subsidiary for one year or more or who is a director, will vest as to 100% of the Shares subject to such Option, if the Participant is Terminated due to "total disability" or death. For purposes of this Section 5.6(a), "total
Vesting
 
disability" shall mean: (i) (A) for so long as such definition is used for purposes of the Company's group life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment plan or group long term disability plan, that the Participant is unable to perform each of the material duties of any gainful occupation for which the Participant is or becomes reasonably fitted by training, education or experience and which total disability is in fact preventing the Participant from engaging in any employment or occupation for wage or profit; or, (B) if such definition has changed, such other definition of "total disability" as determined under the Company's group life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment plan or group long term disability plan; and (ii) the Company shall have received from the Participant's primary physician a certification that the Participant's total disability is likely to be permanent. Any Option held by an employee who is Terminated by the Company, or any Subsidiary or Parent within one year following the date of a Corporate Transaction, will immediately vest as to such number of Shares as the Participant would have been vested in twelve months after the date of Termination had the Participant remained employed for that twelve month period.
     (b) . Following a Participant's Termination, the Participant's Option may be exercised to the extent vested as set forth in Section 5.6(a):
Post-Termination Exercise Period
          (i) no later than 90 days after the Termination Date if a Participant is Terminated for any reason except death or Disability, unless a longer time period, not exceeding five years, is specifically set forth in the Participant's Stock Option Agreement; provided that no Option may be exercised after the Expiration Date of the Option; or
          (ii) no later than (A) twelve months after the Termination Date in the case of Termination due to Disability or (B) eighteen months after the Termination Date in the case of Termination due to death or if a Participant dies within three months of the Termination Date, unless a longer time period, not exceeding five years, is specifically set forth in the Participant's Stock Option Agreement; provided that no Option may be exercised after the Expiration Date of the Option.
          5.7 . The Committee may specify a reasonable minimum number of Shares that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option; provided that the minimum number will not prevent a Participant from exercising an Option for the full number of Shares for which it is then exercisable.
Limitations on Exercise
          5.8 . The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of Shares with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under the Plan or under any other incentive stock option plan of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary) shall not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of Shares on the date of grant with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the Options for the first $100,000 worth of Shares to become exercisable in that calendar year will be ISOs, and the Options for the Shares with a Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year will be NQSOs. If the Code is amended to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to ISOs, such different limit shall be automatically incorporated into the Plan and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of the Code's amendment.
Limitations on ISOs
          5.9 . If a Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO on or before the later of (a) the date two years after the Date of Grant, and (b) the date one year after the exercise of the ISO (in either case, a ""), the Company may require the Participant to immediately notify the Company in writing of such Disqualifying Disposition.
Notice of Disqualifying Dispositions of Shares Acquired on Exercise of an ISO
Disqualifying Disposition
          5.10 . The Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options and authorize the grant of new Options in substitution therefor; provided that any such action may not, without the written consent of Participant, impair any of Participant's rights under any Option previously granted; and provided, further that without stockholder approval, the modified, extended, renewed or new Option may not have a lower Exercise Price than the outstanding Option. Any outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered shall be treated in accordance with Section 424(h) of the Code. The Committee may reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options without the consent of Participants affected, by a written notice to
Modification, Extension or Renewal
 
them; provided, however, that unless prior stockholder approval is secured, the Exercise Price may not be reduced below that of the outstanding Option.
          5.11 . Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, no term of the Plan relating to ISOs will be interpreted, amended or altered, and no discretion or authority granted under the Plan will be exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code or, without the consent of the Participant affected, to disqualify any ISO under Section 422 of the Code.
No Disqualification
     
6. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.
          6.1 . A Restricted Stock Award is an offer by the Company to sell to an eligible person Shares that are subject to restrictions. The Committee will determine to whom an offer will be made, the number of Shares the person may purchase, the Purchase Price, the restrictions under which the Shares will be subject and all other terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Award, subject to the following:
Awards of Restricted Stock
          6.2 . All purchases under a Restricted Stock Award will be evidenced by a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, which will be in substantially a form (which need not be the same for each Participant) that the Committee or an officer of the Company (pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) has from time to time approved, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. A Participant accepts a Restricted Stock Award by signing and delivering to the Company a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement with full payment of the Purchase Price, within thirty days from the date the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement was delivered to the Participant. If the Participant does not accept the Restricted Stock Award within thirty days, then the offer of the Restricted Stock Award will terminate, unless the Committee determines otherwise.
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement
          6.3 . The Purchase Price for a Restricted Stock Award will be determined by the Committee and, subject to the limit of Section 2.1, may be less than Fair Market Value (but not less than the par value of the Shares) on the date the Restricted Stock Award is granted. Payment of the Purchase Price must be made in accordance with Section 11 of the Plan and the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with any procedures established by the Company's Stock Administration Department, as communicated and made available to Participants through the stock pages on the Intuit Legal Department intranet web site, and/or through the Company's electronic mail system.
Purchase Price
          6.4 . Restricted Stock Awards will be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose. These restrictions may be based on completion of a specified number of years of service with the Company or upon completion of the performance goals based on Performance Factors during any Performance Period as set out in advance in the Participant's Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement. Prior to the grant of a Restricted Stock Award, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the Restricted Stock Award; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals, if any; and (c) determine the number of Shares that may be awarded to the Participant. Prior to the payment for Shares to be purchased under any Restricted Stock Award, the Committee shall determine the extent to which such Restricted Stock Award has been earned. Performance Periods may overlap and a Participant may participate simultaneously with respect to Restricted Stock Awards that are subject to different Performance Periods and having different performance goals and other criteria.
Terms of Restricted Stock Awards
          6.5 . If a Participant is Terminated during a Performance Period or vesting period, for any reason, then such Participant will be entitled to payment (whether in Shares, cash or otherwise) with respect to the Restricted Stock Award only to the extent earned as of the date of Termination in accordance with the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, unless the Committee will determine otherwise.
Termination During Performance Period
     
7. STOCK BONUS AWARDS.
          7.1 . A Stock Bonus Award is an award to an eligible person of Shares (which may consist of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units) for services to be rendered or for past services already rendered to the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary. All Stock Bonus Awards shall be made
Awards of Stock Bonuses

No payment will be required for Shares awarded pursuant to a Stock Bonus Award, but the number of Shares awarded is subject to the limit of Section 2.1.
          7.2 . The Committee will determine the number of Shares to be awarded to the Participant under a Stock Bonus Award and any restrictions thereon. These restrictions may be based upon completion of a specified number of years of service with the Company or upon satisfaction of performance goals based on Performance Factors during any Performance Period as set out in advance in the Participant's Stock Bonus Agreement. If the Stock Bonus Award is to be earned upon the satisfaction of performance goals, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for the Stock Bonus Award; (b) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure performance goals; and (c) determine the number of Shares that may be awarded to the Participant. Prior to the issuance of any Shares or other payment to a Participant pursuant to a Stock Bonus Award, the Committee will determine the extent to which the Stock Bonus Award has been earned. Performance Periods may overlap and a Participant may participate simultaneously with respect to Stock Bonus Awards that are subject to different Performance Periods and different performance goals and other criteria. The number of Shares may be fixed or may vary in accordance with such performance goals and criteria as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may adjust the performance goals applicable to a Stock Bonus Award to take into account changes in law and accounting or tax rules and to make such adjustments as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the impact of extraordinary or unusual items, events or circumstances to avoid windfalls or hardships.
Terms of Stock Bonus Awards
          7.3 . The Committee will determine whether the earned portion of a Stock Bonus Award will be paid to the Participant currently or on a deferred basis with such interest or dividend equivalent, if any, as the Committee may determine. To the extent permissible under law, the Committee may also permit a Participant to defer payment under a Stock Bonus Award to a date or dates after the Stock Bonus Award is earned provided that the terms of the Stock Bonus Award and any deferral satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and provided further that payout shall not be deferred beyond March 15 of the year following the year of vesting unless a deferral election in compliance with Section 409A of the Code has been made. Payment may be made in the form of cash, whole Shares, or a combination thereof, based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares earned under a Stock Bonus Award on the date of payment, and in either a lump sum payment or in installments.
Form of Payment to Participant
          7.4 . In the event of a Participant's Termination during a Performance Period or vesting period, for any reason, then such Participant will be entitled to payment (whether in Shares, cash or otherwise) with respect to the Stock Bonus Award only to the extent earned as of the date of Termination in accordance with the Stock Bonus Agreement, unless the Committee determines otherwise.

A Stock Appreciation Right ("") is an award to an eligible person that may be settled in cash, or Shares (which may consist of Restricted Stock), having a value equal to the value determined by multiplying the difference between the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise over the Exercise Price and the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is being settled. The SAR may be granted for services to be rendered or for past services already rendered to the Company, or any Parent or Subsidiary. All SARs shall be made pursuant to a SAR Agreement, which shall be in substantially a form (which need not be the same for each Participant) that the Committee or an officer of the Company (pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) has from time to time approved, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan

If the SAR is being earned upon the satisfaction of performance goals, then the Committee will: (x) determine the nature, length and starting date of any Performance Period for each SAR; and (y) select from among the Performance Factors to be used to measure the performance, if any. Prior to settlement of any SAR earned upon the satisfaction of performance goals pursuant to a SAR Agreement, the Committee shall determine the extent to which such SAR has been earned.

          8.3 . A SAR will be exercisable within the times or upon the occurrence of events determined by the Committee and set forth in the SAR Agreement governing such SAR. The SAR Agreement shall set forth the last date that the SAR may be exercised (the ""); provided that no SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of seven years from the date the SAR is granted. The Committee may also provide for SARs to become exercisable at one time or from time to time, periodically or otherwise (including, without limitation, upon the attainment during a Performance Period of performance goals based on Performance Factors), in such number of Shares or percentage of the Shares subject to the SAR as the Committee determines.

A Restricted Stock Unit ("") is an award to an eligible person covering a number of Shares that may be settled in cash, or by issuance of those Shares (which may consist of Restricted Stock) for services to be rendered or for past services already rendered to the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary. The Committee may authorize the issuance of RSUs to certain eligible persons who elect to defer cash compensation. All RSUs shall be made pursuant to a RSU Agreement, which shall be in substantially a form (which need not be the same for each Participant) that the Committee or an officer of the Company (pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) has from time to time approved, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan (including the limit set forth in Section 2.1).

Performance Periods may overlap and participants may participate simultaneously with respect to RSUs that are subject to different Performance Periods and different performance goals and other criteria. The number of Shares may be fixed or may vary in accordance with such performance goals and criteria as may be determined by the Committee. The Committee may adjust the performance goals applicable to the RSUs to take into account changes in law and accounting and to make such adjustments as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the impact of extraordinary or unusual items, events or circumstances to avoid windfalls or hardships.
Terms of RSUs
 
          9.3 . The portion of a RSU being settled may be paid currently or on a deferred basis with such interest or dividend equivalent, if any, as the Committee determines.

The Shares may be subject to legends or other restrictions as described in Section 15 of the Plan.

Withholding Generally
          12.2 . When, under applicable tax laws, a Participant incurs tax liability in connection with the exercise or vesting of any Award that is subject to tax withholding and the Participant is obligated to pay the Company the amount required to be withheld, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, allow the Participant to satisfy the minimum withholding tax obligation by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued that number of whole Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in accordance with the requirements established by the Committee and be in writing in a form acceptable to the Committee.
Stock Withholding
     . No Participant or Authorized Transferee will have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares until the Shares are issued to the Participant or Authorized Transferee.

13. PRIVILEGES OF STOCK OWNERSHIP
 
Authorized Transferee may become entitled to receive with respect to the Shares by virtue of a stock dividend, stock split or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company will be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock; provided further, that the Participant or Authorized Transferee will have no right to retain such dividends or distributions with respect to Shares that are repurchased at the Participant's original Exercise Price or Purchase Price pursuant to Section 15.
     . No Award and no interest therein, shall be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and no Award may be made subject to execution, attachment or similar process; provided, however that with the consent of the Committee a Participant may transfer a NQSO to an Authorized Transferee. Transfers by the Participant for consideration are prohibited. Without such permission by the Committee, a NQSO shall like all other Awards under the Plan be exercisable (a) during a Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative; and (b) after Participant's death, by the legal representative of the Participant's heirs or legatees.
14. TRANSFERABILITY
     At the discretion of the Committee, the Company may reserve to itself and/or its assignee(s) in the Award Agreement a right to repurchase all or a portion of a Participant's Shares that are not "Vested" (as defined in the Award Agreement), following the Participant's Termination, at any time within ninety days after the later of (a) the Participant's Termination Date or (b) the date the Participant purchases Shares under the Plan, for cash or cancellation of purchase money indebtedness with respect to Shares, at the Participant's original Exercise Price or Purchase Price; provided that upon assignment of the right to repurchase, the assignee must pay the Company cash equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the Shares over the original Purchase Price.
15. RESTRICTIONS ON SHARES.
     All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan (whether in physical or electronic form, as appropriate) will be subject to stock transfer orders, legends and other restrictions that the Committee deems necessary or advisable, including without limitation restrictions under any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law, or any rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares may be listed.
16. CERTIFICATES.
     To enforce any restrictions on a Participant's Shares, the Committee may require the Participant to deposit all certificates representing Shares, together with stock powers or other transfer instruments approved by the Committee, appropriately endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent designated by the Company, to hold in escrow until such restrictions have lapsed or terminated, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends referencing such restrictions to be placed on the certificates.
17. ESCROW.
     . An Award shall not be effective unless the Award is in compliance with all applicable state, federal and foreign securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Shares may then be listed, as they are in effect on the date of grant of the Award and also on the date of exercise or other issuance. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under the Plan prior to (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable, and/or (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state, federal or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. The Company shall be under no obligation to register the Shares with the SEC or to effect compliance with the registration, qualification or listing requirements of any state, federal or foreign securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company shall have no liability for any inability or failure to do so.
18. SECURITIES LAW AND OTHER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

19. NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY
 
     . The repricing of Options or SARs is prohibited without prior stockholder approval. The Committee may, at any time or from time to time, authorize the Company, with prior stockholder approval, in the case of an Option or SAR exchange, and the consent of the respective Participants, to issue new Awards in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Awards. The Committee may at any time buy from a Participant an Option previously granted with payment in cash, Shares or other consideration, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee and the Participant shall agree; provided, however, that in no event will an Option with an Exercise Price above the Fair Market Value at the time of such proposed buyout be repurchased.
20. REPRICING PROHIBITED; EXCHANGE AND BUYOUT OF AWARDS
     
21. CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.
          21.1 . Except as provided for in Section 10.8(e), in the event of a Corporate Transaction any or all outstanding Awards may be assumed or replaced by the successor corporation, which assumption or replacement shall be binding on all Participants. In the alternative, the successor corporation may substitute equivalent Awards or provide substantially similar consideration to Participants as was provided to stockholders (after taking into account the existing provisions of the Awards). The successor corporation may also issue, in place of outstanding Shares of the Company held by the Participant, substantially similar shares or other property subject to repurchase restrictions no less favorable to the Participant. In the event such successor corporation, if any, refuses to assume or replace the Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction or if there is no successor corporation due to a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, such Awards shall immediately vest as to 100% of the Shares subject thereto at such time and on such conditions as the Board shall determine and the Awards shall expire at the closing of the transaction or at the time of dissolution or liquidation.
Assumption or Replacement of Awards by Successor
          21.2 . Subject to any greater rights granted to Participants under Section 21.1, in the event of a Corporate Transaction, any outstanding Awards shall be treated as provided in the applicable agreement or plan of merger, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation or sale of assets.
Other Treatment of Awards
          21.3 . The Company, from time to time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or otherwise, by either (a) granting an Award under the Plan in substitution of such other company's award, or (b) assuming such award as if it had been granted under the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under the Plan. Such substitution or assumption shall be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under the Plan if the other company had applied the rules of the Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award shall remain unchanged (except that the exercise price and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon exercise of any such option will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to Section 424(a) of the Code). In the event the Company elects to grant a new Option rather than assuming an existing option, such new Option may be granted with a similarly adjusted Exercise Price.
Assumption of Awards by the Company
     The Plan was adopted by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee on August 26, 2004. The Plan shall become effective upon approval by stockholders of the Company, consistent with applicable laws.
22. ADOPTION AND STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.
     The Plan will terminate five years following the date it originally became effective upon approval by stockholders of the Company.
23. TERM OF PLAN.
     The Board may at any time terminate or amend the Plan in any respect, including without limitation amendment of any form of Award Agreement or instrument to be executed pursuant to the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Board nor the Committee shall, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, amend the Plan in any manner that requires such stockholder approval pursuant to the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder as such provisions apply to ISO plans or pursuant to the Exchange Act or any rule promulgated thereunder or pursuant to the listing requirements of the national securities market on which the Shares are listed. In addition, no amendment that is detrimental to a Participant may be made to any outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant.
24. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN.
 
     Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board, the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval, nor any provision of the Plan shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such additional compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options and bonuses otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the Company nor the Board shall be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards made pursuant to the Plan. Neither the Company, the Committee, nor the Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's double-digit revenue growth and other future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2008 and beyond; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities regulating the filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2007 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at Forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 20, 2008, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated May 20, 2008 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

Senior Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goal
     On October 21, 2008, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") established the threshold performance goal for the fiscal year 2009 bonuses payable to executive officers Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Alexander M. Lintner, Kiran M. Patel, Sasan K. Goodarzi, Scott D. Cook and William V. Campbell under the Intuit Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"). The SEIP is a cash incentive plan that was approved by Intuit's stockholders in December 2007. The purposes of the SEIP are to motivate senior executives by tying compensation to performance, reward exceptional performance that supports overall Intuit objectives, and attract and retain top performing employees. Under the SEIP, the Compensation Committee establishes one or more performance goals for each fiscal year. A copy of the SEIP was filed as an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed by Intuit on December 17, 2007. The Compensation Committee established a threshold performance goal based on a specified revenue target that Intuit must achieve as a condition to payment of any bonuses under the SEIP for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2009. The maximum bonus payout under the SEIP is $5 million per participant. If the threshold performance goal is achieved, actual individual bonus amounts will be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon such performance criteria as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The bonus payments are also subject to the other terms of the SEIP.

These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; if economic and market conditions in the U.S. and worldwide continue to decline, our customers may delay or reduce technology purchases which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our

offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2008 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 19, 2008, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated November 19, 2008 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR CERTAIN OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF CERTAIN OFFICERS; COMPENSATORY ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN OFFICERS.
     At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") held on December 16, 2008, Intuit's stockholders approved an amendment to Intuit's 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to (i) extend the term of the Plan by an additional year, through December 9, 2010; (ii) provide for the addition of 10,000,000 shares to cover awards under the Plan through its amended term; (iii) amend certain terms of the Plan related to non-employee director automatic option grants; (iv) amend certain terms of the Plan to provide that stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be granted with an exercise price that is less than fair market value on the grant date thereof; and (v) amend certain terms of the Plan to eliminate the potential for deferred settlement of stock appreciation rights. The amendment to the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan was previously adopted by Intuit's Board of Directors, subject to the approval of stockholders, which was received on December 16, 2008.
     Employees of Intuit and its subsidiaries, non-employee directors of Intuit and consultants of Intuit and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the Plan. Awards under the Plan may be in the form of non-qualified and incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards. In any fiscal year, no more than 50% of the shares subject to equity awards granted in such fiscal year may have an exercise price or purchase price per share that is less than fair market value on the applicable date of grant. So that awards may qualify under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which permits performance-based compensation meeting the requirements established by the IRS to be excluded from the limitation on deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain senior executives, the Plan limits awards to individual participants as follows: (1) no more than 6,000,000 shares may be made subject to awards granted to an employee in the year of his or her hire; and (2) no more than 4,000,000 shares may be made subject to awards granted to an employee in any other year. Stock options and stock appreciation rights will have a term no longer than seven years. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee may make the grant, issuance, retention and/or vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and stock bonus awards contingent upon continued employment with Intuit, the passage of time, or such performance criteria and the level of achievement versus such criteria as it deems appropriate. Repricing, or reducing the exercise price of a stock option or stock appreciation right without stockholder approval is prohibited. The Plan also prohibits the repurchase of any outstanding "underwater" option (an option with an exercise price greater than the then-current fair market value of the stock).
     The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual terms of the Plan. The Plan is filed as an exhibit to this report. For additional information about the Plan, refer to Proposal 3, on pages 42-47, of Intuit's 2008 proxy statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 31, 2008.
ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS
     In December 2008, Scott D. Cook, founder, board member and Chairman of the Executive Committee of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan on behalf of his family trust to sell up to 2,000,000 shares of Intuit common stock and contribute 400,000 additional shares to the Scott Cook and Signe Ostby Charitable Foundation beginning in February 2009 and continuing through December 2009. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, Mr. Cook's family trust will sell 500,000 shares and contribute 100,000 shares to the charitable foundation each quarter provided certain limit prices are reached.
     The Scott Cook and Signe Ostby Charitable Foundation also adopted a stock trading plan in December 2008 to sell the 400,000 shares of Intuit stock contributed by Mr. Cook's family trust during the same period provided certain limit prices are reached.
Table of Contents
     In December 2008, Stephen M. Bennett, a board member of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 900,000 shares issuable under options granted in July and September 2002, which expire in July and September 2009. Pursuant to this plan, a brokerage firm may exercise Mr. Bennett's stock options and sell the issued shares before the expiration date of the option. The exercise and sale transactions under this plan will only be executed if the market price of Intuit stock exceeds certain limit prices set forth in the plan.
     Each of these plans is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and each was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.

Exhibit 99.01
Highlights:
     - Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced second quarter GAAP operating income of $110 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share of 26 cents, well above its expected range. Second-quarter revenue of $791 million, a five percent decrease from the year-ago quarter, reflects timing changes of $58 million of revenue in its tax businesses between the second and third quarters. Without those changes, revenue would have grown two percent.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 19, 2009
     "Second-quarter operating income and earnings per share significantly exceeded our guidance, and revenue was within our expected range," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "We continue to adapt in this strained economy and manage the business by focusing on customer acquisition and investing in innovation. By managing our expenses, we expect to deliver strong earnings growth for the year.
     "While our company is not recession-proof, we are resilient. Consumers and small business owners are focused on saving and making money, and that is what our products are designed to deliver. We help them put more money in their pockets,

which creates demand for many of our offerings in any environment. That's why we still expect to deliver positive revenue growth for fiscal year 2009," Smith said.

This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E which follow it.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2009 and beyond; and all of the statements under the headings "Third-Quarter 2009 Guidance" and "Fiscal 2009 Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; if economic and market conditions in the U.S. and worldwide continue to decline, our customers may delay or reduce technology purchases which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2008 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at . Forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 19, 2009, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.

The accompanying press release dated February 19, 2009 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss) and related operating margin as a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the organization, our operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related costs, or the other excluded items that may impact their business units' operating income (loss) and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We also exclude these amounts from our budget and planning process. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
The following describes each non-GAAP financial measure, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measure in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
We refer to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Intuit's ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to Intuit's historical operating results. We have historically reported similar non-GAAP financial measures and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately preceding this Table B for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
Approval of Fiscal Year 2009 Bonus Awards and Fiscal Year 2010 Base Salaries
On July 28, 2009, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit's Board of Directors (the "Committee") certified that the performance goal established for Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") for the year ended July 31, 2009 ("Fiscal 2009") had been achieved and subsequently approved annual performance bonuses for Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Kiran M. Patel, Alexander M. Lintner, Sasan K. Goodarzi, William V. Campbell and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee (and in the case of Mr. Smith and Mr. Campbell, by the independent members of the Board of Directors) based on a review of the performance of each eligible individual and on the Company's revenue and non-GAAP operating income for Fiscal 2009.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. There was no increase in base salary for any executive officer. Mr. Campbell's compensation was set to be commensurate with his role as non-executive Chairman of the Board. Mr. Campbell is not considered an independent director because of his continued employment status. The following table sets forth the bonus and annual base salary approved for the specified individuals.
 
In addition to the bonuses described above, Mr. Patel and Mr. Goodarzi received bonuses of $60,000 and $30,000, respectively, to help defray costs associated with travel between the executive's home and his work location.
Funding of 2009 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 28, 2009, the Committee approved funding for the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees (other than individuals eligible to receive bonuses under the SEIP) under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2009 in the aggregate amount of $80,000,000. A majority of Intuit's full time employees are eligible for annual performance bonus awards under the IPI for Fiscal 2009.
Approval of 2010 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 28, 2009, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2010, a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal year 2010 will be based upon the individual employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal year 2010, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal year 2010 based on overall performance of Intuit. A copy of the IPI for fiscal year 2010 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01.

Grants of Restricted Stock Units to Executive Officers
On August 11, 2009, Intuit Inc. granted Restricted Stock Units (the "2009 RSUs") to certain executive officers as part of Intuit's annual performance review process. Approximately 55% of the 2009 RSUs will be performance-based and will vest in 2012 (or in the case of the CEO, in 2012 and 2014) as to a variable percentage of the underlying shares if, and to the extent that, Intuit achieves specified goals for year-over-year revenue growth and return on invested capital ("ROIC") for the year ending July 31, 2010. The other 45% of the 2009 RSUs will vest over time as to equal increments in 2011 and 2012 (or in the case of the CEO, in 2012 and 2014). In the aggregate, Intuit issued approximately 123,000 performance-based RSUs and 98,000 time-based RSUs to its most senior executives. These grants have been reported on Forms 4 filed on August 13, 2009.
In addition, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee) has approved amendments to the performance-based RSUs granted to certain executive officers on August 11, 2008 (the "2008 RSUs") to establish new performance goals for the 2008 RSUs. In light of the economic downturn, Intuit did not achieve its original performance goals for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2009. The Committee determined that it was appropriate and in the best interests of Intuit and its stockholders to amend these performance goals by setting new targets applicable to 2010, thereby providing further incentive to the executive officers to achieve 2010 revenue growth and ROIC goals. As amended, the 2008 RSUs will vest in 2011 (or in the case of the CEO, in 2011 and 2013) as to a variable percentage of the total number of underlying shares if, and to the extent that, Intuit achieves specified goals for year-over-year revenue growth and ROIC for the year ending July 31, 2010. These amendments affected approximately 151,000 RSUs held by Intuit's most senior executives.

If the Committee determines that the Performance Goals were not met by July 31, 2010 (and an event described in either Section 1(c) or 1(d) has not occurred on or before the Determination Date) this Award shall terminate upon the Determination Date.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Aug. 20, 2009
               Intuit also provided full-year guidance for the 2010 fiscal year, projecting GAAP operating income growth of 15 to 21 percent, non-GAAP operating income growth of 6 to 10 percent, GAAP earnings per share growth of 10 to 16 percent and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 4 to 8 percent.
               "We delivered solid revenue and operating income growth in 2009 by staying focused on helping our customers save and make money in this tough economy, while maintaining our own operating discipline," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Connected services that solve important customer problems, led by our SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings, grew 14 percent this past year. These predictable revenue streams continue to be the fastest-growing portion of our business, and a key element of our future."
               "As a result, we are entering our new fiscal year with larger customer bases and stronger positions in all of our core businesses. This gives us confidence that we'll have another good year in fiscal 2010," Smith said.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit on Aug. 20, 2009 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2010; and all of the statements under the headings "Forward-looking Guidance," "Fiscal 2010 Business Segment Guidance", and "First-Quarter Fiscal 2010 Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; if economic and market conditions in the U.S. and worldwide continue to decline, our customers may delay or reduce technology purchases which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks

See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
The accompanying press release dated August 20, 2009 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related charges, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required under GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of purchased intangible assets in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Acquisition-related charges in operating expenses include amortization of other purchased intangible assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the portion of technology licensing fees that relates to historical use of that technology.
Charge for historical use of technology licensing rights
We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record from time to time when we sell or otherwise dispose of businesses and assets that are not considered discontinued operations under GAAP.
Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and assets.
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair marketable equity securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on marketable equity securities and other investments
 
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the adjustments described above that relate to the current period as well as adjustments for similar items that relate to prior periods. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

On October 1, 2009, Stephen M. Bennett informed the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. that he will not stand for re-election to the Board at Intuit's next annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Bennett, who served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Intuit from January 2000 to January 2008, indicated that he was leaving the Board to pursue other opportunities in light of the successful transition of leadership to Brad D. Smith, Intuit's current President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Bennett has served as a director of Intuit since 2000.
In recognition of the many years of commitment and service provided by Mr. Bennett, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board approved the acceleration of vesting of Mr. Bennett's non-employee director stock option. The option to purchase 67,500 shares, granted in January 2009, will become fully vested and exercisable in December 2009, on the day before Mr. Bennett's final day on the Board. A quarter of these options would have vested on January 13, 2010. Based on Intuit's closing stock price of $28.50 on September 30, 2009, the value of the accelerated options would be approximately $300,000.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Senior Executive Incentive Plan Performance Goal
     On October 20, 2009, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") established the threshold performance goal for the fiscal year 2010 bonuses payable to executive officers Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Kiran M. Patel, Daniel R. Maurer, Alexander M. Lintner, Sasan K. Goodarzi, and Scott D. Cook under the Intuit Inc. Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP"). The SEIP is a cash incentive plan that was approved by Intuit's stockholders in December 2007. The purposes of the SEIP are to motivate senior executives by tying compensation to performance, reward exceptional performance that supports overall Intuit objectives, and attract and retain top performing employees. Under the SEIP, the Compensation Committee establishes one or more performance goals for each fiscal year. A copy of the SEIP was filed as an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed by Intuit on December 17, 2007. The Compensation Committee established a threshold performance goal based on a specified revenue target that Intuit must achieve as a condition to payment of any bonuses under the SEIP for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2010. The maximum bonus payout under the SEIP is $5 million per participant. If the threshold performance goal is achieved, actual individual bonus amounts will be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon such performance criteria as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The bonus payments are also subject to the other terms of the SEIP.

Adoption of Policy Concerning Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
     In October 2009 the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. (the "Company") adopted a policy that, beginning with the Company's annual meeting in 2010, will provide stockholders the opportunity to vote annually on an advisory basis whether they concur with the Company's compensation philosophy, policies and determinations for its named executive officers, as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of the Company's annual proxy statement. The Company's Board and management believe that it is useful and appropriate to seek the views of stockholders when considering the design and implementation of executive compensation programs. The advisory vote on executive compensation will be non-binding but will be considered by the Compensation Committee in determining annual compensation for executive officers in subsequent periods.

"With these early results, we are confident that we will grow revenue and expand operating margins. We will continue to invest in targeted, high-yield opportunities while also managing expenses.
          "We continue to see growth in our core businesses and are making progress in building out adjacent businesses.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit on Nov. 19, 2009 can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2010; the features and availability of future products and services; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our financial results; if economic and market conditions in the U.S. and worldwide continue to decline, our customers may delay or reduce technology purchases which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our
 
Intuit First Quarter 2010 Earnings Page 6
revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2009 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://www.intuit.com/about_intuit/investors. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of Nov. 19, 2009, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these remarks.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
The accompanying press release dated November 19, 2009 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related charges, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of purchased intangible assets in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Acquisition-related charges in operating expenses include amortization of other purchased intangible assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair marketable equity securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on marketable equity securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the adjustments described above that relate to the current period as well as adjustments for similar items that relate to prior periods. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

     A more complete description of the terms of the ESPP and the amendment thereto can be found in "Proposal No. 4  Approval of an Amendment to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan" (pages 54 through 56) in Intuit's definitive proxy statement dated October 30, 2009, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2009.

Table of Contents
beginning in February 2010 and continuing through December 2010. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, Mr. Cook's family trust will sell 300,000 shares and contribute 60,000 shares to the charitable foundation each quarter provided certain limit prices are reached.
     The Scott Cook and Signe Ostby Charitable Foundation also adopted a stock trading plan in December 2010 to sell the 240,000 shares of Intuit stock contributed by Mr. Cook's family trust during the same period provided certain limit prices are reached.

Smith, Intuit's President and Chief Executive Officer, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 200,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2003-2005. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Smith's stock options and sell the issued shares before the expiration of the plan in December 2010, provided certain limit prices are reached.
     Each of these plans is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and each was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions.

Intuit Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Page 2
Note: all comparisons are versus the same period a year ago.
Dollars in millions except for EPS
          Based on these strong results, particularly in the tax business, Intuit raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance. For fiscal year 2010 the company expects revenue growth of 6 to 9 percent, $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. All comparisons exclude the Intuit Real Estate Solutions business, which is accounted for as a discontinued operation.
Company Perspective
          "We are very pleased that our fiscal second quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the top end of our guidance," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "While it is still early in the year, we are confident in our ability to perform well in the second half and therefore are raising our revenue and earnings guidance for the year."
          "We wanted to come out of the recession stronger than we went in, so we focused on adding customers and continued to invest in innovation. These results demonstrate that our strategy is working. We continue to see great success growing our core businesses, with a strong quarter in tax and good results in our small business division. At the same time we're making strides in building out adjacent businesses, entering new geographies and transitioning to connected services."
Quarterly Business Segment Results and Highlights
total revenue was up 5 percent for the second-quarter. Each of the three small business segments saw an increase in average revenue per customer compared to the second quarter of last year.

When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of purchased intangible assets in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Acquisition-related charges in operating expenses include amortization of other purchased intangible assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair marketable equity securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on marketable equity securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the adjustments described above that relate to the current period as well as adjustments for similar items that relate to prior periods. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items
 
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

     On February 23, 2010, Stratton D. Sclavos informed the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") that he will be leaving the Board effective March 1, 2010. Mr. Sclavos indicated that he was leaving the Board due to his need to focus on his responsibilities at the investment firm of Radar Partners and the ever-increasing amount of time he spends on the many other boards on which he serves. Mr. Sclavos has been a director of Intuit since 2001.
     In February 2010, William V. Campbell, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 160,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2000 and 2003. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Campbell's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices before the options expire in July and August 2010.
     In December 2009, Sasan K. Goodarzi, Intuit's Senior Vice President and president of the Intuit Financial Institutions Division, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 120,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2004 and 2005. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Goodarzi's stock options and sell the issued shares before the expiration of the plan in July 2012, provided certain limit prices are reached.
     These plans are intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and were adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR
     On April 28, 2010, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") amended Section 1.7 of Intuit's Bylaws to change the voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections from a plurality to a majority of the votes cast. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted for a director must exceed the number of shares voted against the director. In conjunction with the bylaw amendment, the Board also amended Intuit's Corporate Governance Principles to provide that each director submit in writing an advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that the Board may accept if stockholders do not re-elect that director. In that instance, Intuit's Nominating and Governance Committee would make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results.
     The Board also amended Section 2.2 of the Bylaws by adding provisions for advance, irrevocable, contingent resignations and for the ability of a majority of the directors then in office to fill any vacancy created by the resignation of a director that is effective as of a future date.
     The preceding description of the amendments to Intuit's Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to Intuit's amended and restated Bylaws, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 3.01 and are incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 3.01
     Unless directors are elected by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting, as permitted by Section 211 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date and time as the Board of Directors shall each year fix. The meeting may be held either at a place, within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communication as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may determine.

Section 1.1
:
Annual Meetings
.
     Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, and shall be called upon the request of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, or by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors. Special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. If a special meeting of stockholders is called at the request of any person or persons by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors, then such person or persons shall request such meeting by delivering a written request to call such meeting to each member of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors shall then determine the time and date of such special meeting, which shall be held not more than 120 nor less than 35 days after the written request to call such special meeting was delivered to each member of the Board of Directors. The special meeting may be held either at a place, within or without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communication as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may determine.
Section 1.2
:
Special Meetings
.
other than
     Notice of all meetings of stockholders shall be given in writing or by electronic transmission in the manner provided by law (including, without limitation, as set forth in Section 7.1(b) of these Bylaws) stating the date, time and place, if any, of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, such notice shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting.
Section 1.3
:
Notice of Meetings

     The chair of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The chair shall have the power to adjourn the meeting to another time, date and place (if any). Any meeting of stockholders may adjourn from time to time, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time, date and place (if any) thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; , , that if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the

:
Adjournments
.
provided
however
 
adjourned meeting, then a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.
     At each meeting of stockholders the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except if otherwise required by applicable law. If a quorum shall fail to attend any meeting, the chairperson of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting may adjourn the meeting. Shares of the Corporation's stock belonging to the Corporation (or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation are held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation), shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; , , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any other corporation to vote any shares of the Corporation's stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity and to count such shares for purposes of determining a quorum.
Section 1.5
:
Quorum
.
provided
however
     Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by such person as the Board of Directors may designate, or, in the absence of such a person, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, or, in the absence of such person, the President of the Corporation, or, in the absence of such person, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, at the meeting. Such person shall be chairperson of the meeting and, subject to Section 1.11 hereof, shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seems to him or her to be in order. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in such person's absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 1.6
:
Organization
.
     Unless otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to the provisions of Section 1.8 of these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, or to take corporate action by written consent without a meeting, may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Such a proxy may be prepared, transmitted and delivered in any manner permitted by applicable law. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless such is demanded at the meeting before voting begins by a stockholder or stockholders holding shares representing at least 1% of the votes entitled to vote at such meeting, or by such stockholder's or stockholders' proxy; , , that an election of directors shall be by written ballot if demand is so made by any stockholder at the meeting before voting begins. If a vote is to be taken by written ballot, then each such ballot shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and such other information as the chairperson of the meeting deems appropriate and, if authorized by the Board of Directors, the ballot may be submitted by electronic transmission in the manner provided by law.
Section 1.7
:
Voting; Proxies
.
provided
however
     Except as provided in Section 2.2, each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided that if as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date the corporation files its definitive proxy statement (regardless of whether or not thereafter revised or supplemented) with the Securities and Exchange Commission the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. For purposes of this section, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast against that director. The Nominating and Governance Committee has established procedures under which any director who is not elected shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the
 
Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results. If, for any cause, the Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these Bylaws.
     Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, every matter other than the election of directors shall be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon that are present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and are voted for or against the matter.

Generally
provided
however

Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date for such consent. Such request shall include a brief description of the action proposed to be taken. The Board of Directors shall, within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. Such record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, then the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided in Section 1.10(b) of these Bylaws. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, then the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
(b) 
Stockholder Request for Action by Written Consent
     A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic network

as permitted by law (provided that the information required to gain access to the list is provided with the notice of the meeting) or during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present at the meeting. If the meeting is held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access the list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
     
Section 1.10
:
Action by Written Consent of Stockholders
.
     (a) . Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, and except as set forth in Section 1.8(b) above, any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed in the manner permitted by law by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Written stockholder consents shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent in the manner permitted by law and shall be delivered to the Corporation as provided in subsection (b) below. No written consent shall be effective to take the action set forth therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided above, written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take the action set forth therein are delivered to the Corporation in the manner provided above.
Procedure
     (b) A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this section, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a Corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
     (c) . Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action by stockholders without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of the stockholders shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented thereto in writing and, who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting, if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation as required by law. In the case of a Certificate of Action (as defined below), if the
Notice of Consent
 
Delaware General Corporation Law so requires, such notice shall be given prior to filing of the certificate in question. If the action which is consented to requires the filing of a certificate under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the ""), then if the Delaware General Corporation Law so requires, the certificate so filed shall state that written stockholder consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and that written notice of the taking of corporate action by stockholders without a meeting as described herein has been given as provided in such section.

Company Perspective
     "We delivered another quarter of strong results, with revenue and earnings per share exceeding the top end of our guidance," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "We saw across-the-board strength, fueled by a great tax season, a return to double-digit revenue growth in small business, and continued strong performance from our financial institutions segment. With these strong results, we are once again raising our revenue and earnings outlook for the year.
     "We've worked hard over the past few years to position Intuit to take advantage of the secular market trends that we see as catalysts for sustained growth. In addition, we've invested in hiring and developing skills and capabilities that will benefit us for years. We've strengthened our engineering talent pool, and we've developed technology that improves the usability of our products, adds mobile capabilities, and readies our solutions for global deployment. We've also invested to ensure our customers are delighted with our products and find them incredibly easy to use. This quarter's performance is another proof point that we are stronger now than when the recession began," Smith said.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2010; projected growth in consumer tax for fiscal 2010; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; if economic and market conditions in the U.S. and worldwide continue to decline, our customers may delay or reduce technology purchases which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition; we may not be able to successfully introduce new products and services to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future products and services may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; any failure to maintain reliable and responsive service levels for our offerings could cause us to lose customers and negatively impact our revenues and profitability; any significant product quality problems or delays in our products could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our acquisition activities may be disruptive to Intuit and may not result in expected benefits; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; predicting tax-related revenues is challenging due to the heavy concentration of activity in a short time period; we have implemented, and are continuing to upgrade, new information systems and any problems with these new systems could interfere with our ability to deliver products and services and gather information to effectively manage our business; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2009 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 20, 2010, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
The accompanying press release dated May 20, 2010 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expenses, acquisition-related charges, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of purchased intangible assets in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Acquisition-related charges in operating expenses include amortization of other purchased intangible assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the portion of technology licensing fees that relates to historical use of that technology.
Charges for historical use of technology licensing rights
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair marketable equity securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on marketable equity securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the adjustments described above that relate to the current period as well as adjustments for similar items that relate to prior periods. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items
 
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

Approval of Fiscal Year 2010 Bonus Awards and Fiscal Year 2011 Base Salaries
On July 21, 2010, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of Intuit's Board of Directors (the "Committee") certified that the performance goal established for Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") for the year ended July 31, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010") had been achieved and subsequently approved annual performance bonuses for Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Kiran M. Patel, Alexander M. Lintner, Sasan K. Goodarzi and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on a review of the performance of each eligible individual and on the Company's revenue and non-GAAP operating income for Fiscal 2010.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the bonus and annual base salary approved for the specified individuals.
In addition to the bonuses described above, Mr. Patel and Mr. Goodarzi received bonuses of $100,000 and $35,000, respectively, to help defray costs associated with travel between the executive's home and his work location.
Funding of 2010 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 21, 2010, the Committee approved funding for the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees (other than individuals eligible to receive bonuses
 
under the SEIP) under the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan ("IPI") for Fiscal 2010 in the aggregate amount of $124,000,000. A majority of Intuit's full time employees are eligible for annual performance bonus awards under the IPI for Fiscal 2010.
Approval of 2011 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 21, 2010, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2011, a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal year 2011 will be based upon the individual employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal year 2011, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal year 2011 based on overall performance of Intuit.

Grants of Options and Restricted Stock Units to Executive Officers
On July 22, 2010, Intuit Inc. (the "Company") granted stock options ("Options") and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to certain executive officers as part of the Company's annual performance review process. The Options vest over three years (except for the CEO, whose Options vest 50% on the third, and 50% on the fifth anniversaries of the grant date).
The executive officers received three types of RSU awards. The first type of RSU award vests in equal annual installments over three years (except for the CEO, whose RSUs vest 50% on the third and 50% on the fifth anniversaries of the grant date), subject to the Company meeting a pre-established operating income goal. The second type of RSU award vests only if specified operating income and revenue targets are met for the period of August 1, 2010 through July 31, 2013 (the "Performance Period"). The vesting of the third type of RSU award depends on the total shareholder return of the Company's common stock relative to a specified peer group during the Performance Period. In the case of the CEO, the second and third types of RSU awards additionally are subject to the completion of two years of continuous service after the end of the Performance Period. The final determination of the level of achievement of performance goals applicable to the RSUs will be subject to certification by the Company's Compensation and Organizational Development Committee.
These grants, as applicable, have been reported on Forms 4 on July 26, 2010.
Announcement of the Date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders
The Company has scheduled its next Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") for January 19, 2011 to coincide with the Company's January 2011 meeting of the Board of Directors in order to facilitate the attendance of the Board members at the Annual Meeting.
Rule 14a-8 Shareholder Proposal Deadline
Because the expected date of the Annual Meeting represents a change of more than 30 days from the anniversary of the Company's 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company has set a new deadline for the receipt of stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for the Annual Meeting. In order to be considered timely, such proposals must be received by the Corporate Secretary at the
 
Company's principal executive office at 2700 Coast Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94043 no later than August 31, 2010.
Bylaws Timely Notice Deadline
In accordance with the requirements for a timely notice in the Company's bylaws, and as stated in the Company's 2009 Proxy Statement, any stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal that is not intended for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement or nominate a person for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting, must provide written notice of the proposal or nomination to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal executive office at 2700 Coast Avenue, Mountain View, CA 94043 between September 1, 2010 and October 1, 2010. Such notices must comply with the requirements of the Company's bylaws. The Company's bylaws are available from the Company upon request and are also on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Aug. 19, 2010
Intuit Inc
Fiscal Year 2010 Highlights:
     Intuit provided guidance for fiscal year 2011, which ends July 31, and expects revenue of $3.74 billion to $3.84 billion or growth of 8 to 11 percent.
 
Intuit Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Page 2
Dollars in millions, except EPS.
     Growth in GAAP earnings is higher than non-GAAP because amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-cash stock compensation expense, which are classified as GAAP only, are growing slower than revenue. GAAP net income and EPS also benefited from the $35 million net gain on the sale of the Real Estate Solutions business in January 2010.
Fourth-Quarter 2010 Highlights:

Company Perspective
     "We completed another strong quarter, capping off a great fiscal year," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "For the year, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in what continues to be a challenging economic environment. Our results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working, and our execution is on track. We are pleased with our financial performance, and have built positive momentum as we head into fiscal year 2011.
     "Intuit is a leader in categories that are growing. We're increasing our share in small business and consumer tax. We are accelerating customer growth and improving revenue per customer. Our next phase of growth is being driven by the clear market shift to digital or connected services. Intuit is perfectly positioned for this shift, and making strong progress in building the next phase of our growth on our leading software-as-a-service offerings."
Quarterly Business Segment Results and Highlights
     Total revenue grew 9 percent for the year and 16 percent for the quarter, driven by strong performance in Financial Management Solutions and Employee Management Solutions.

Company Perspective
          "We completed another strong quarter, getting us off to a good start in fiscal 2011. Our biggest quarters lie ahead of us," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Although the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we're executing well against our strategy, and that's driving solid financial performance.
          "We delivered double-digit revenue growth, demonstrating that our strategy is working. Our Small Business Group continues to show strength across the board. The early feedback on QuickBooks 2011 and QuickBooks Online is very positive and shows the potential of our core products. We are also seeing more people choosing Intuit Websites solutions, and healthy interest in our newly available mobile solutions coming to market.
          "The market is clearly shifting to digital, or connected services. That plays to our advantage, and will help drive the next phase of our growth. It's especially clear in our tax business, where recent competitive events demonstrate the power and acceptance of digital services. That's our sweet spot. As we look forward to the tax season, we believe we're well positioned to expand the category and continue to grow share, with a strong marketing effort and a product line that offers customers the easiest-to-use solution at a compelling price."

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2011; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if
 
Intuit First Quarter 2011 Earnings Page 7
we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending and financial institutions, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2010 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 18, 2010, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.
 
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
The accompanying press release dated November 18, 2010 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
 
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the portion of technology licensing fees that relates to historical use of that technology.
Charges for historical use of technology licensing rights
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair marketable equity securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on marketable equity securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items and discrete tax items
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

Campbell, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc., adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 100,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2001. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Campbell's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices before the options expire in April 2011.
     In December 2010, Scott D. Cook, founder and board member of Intuit Inc., adopted a stock trading plan on behalf of his family trust and six grantor retained annuity trusts, of which he is a trustee, to sell up to 2,018,360 shares of Intuit common stock and contribute up to 400,000 additional shares to the Valhalla Charitable Foundation between February 2011 and December 2011. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, Mr. Cook's family trust and the grantor retained annuity trusts will periodically sell up to 2,018,360 shares and contribute up to 400,000 shares to the charitable foundation provided certain limit prices are reached.
     These plans are intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and were adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
     Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
     The Valhalla Charitable Foundation also adopted a stock trading plan in December 2010 to sell up to 400,000 shares of Intuit stock contributed by Mr. Cook's family trust during the same period provided certain limit prices are reached.

Exhibit 99.01
      . (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced financial results for its second fiscal quarter, which ended Jan. 31.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  Feb. 17, 2011
Intuit Inc
Second-quarter Highlights:
     Intuit also increased fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect the extension of the research and development tax credit, which will lower the company's
 
Intuit Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Page 2
effective tax rate. Intuit now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of 14 to 18 percent.
Note: GAAP diluted EPS for Q2 FY10 included $0.10 for the gain on the sale of the Intuit Real Estate Solutions business.
Company Perspective
     "Intuit delivered strong financial results for the fiscal second quarter," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Reiterating our full-year guidance demonstrates our confidence in our growth strategy and our ability to execute for the remainder of the tax season and the fiscal year.
     "Small Business continues to perform well, with growth accelerating from last quarter. Our core business is growing, and our connected services are driving customer acquisition and revenue growth. We are capitalizing on secular tailwinds as customer preferences move toward more digital, connected services in the small business sector.
     "We believe that later acceptance of tax returns will simply mean a shorter tax season as filers are getting started later. This is supported by the unit growth acceleration we've seen in TurboTax Online in February. The move toward do-it-yourself digital tax solutions continues as a macro trend, and it basically comes down to staying laser focused on execution. All indications are that we're competing effectively for market share, and we have confidence in our game plan for the balance of the season," Smith said.

"We continue to manage the company for long-term, double-digit organic revenue growth. We're focused on allocating capital in the most effective ways, using the cash we generate to grow the business and return value to shareholders. I'm pleased with our strong performance this quarter and believe we are well positioned to succeed in the second half of the year."

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; forecasts of future expected financial results for its Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals group; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2011; its prospects for the current tax season; its belief that tax revenue and operating income (GAAP and NonGAAP) will shift to its third fiscal quarter, and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-looking Guidance."

These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; further delay in the IRS's ability to accept e-filed returns for certain tax filers; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions

effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2010 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of Feb. 17, 2011, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
The accompanying press release dated February 17, 2011 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and purchases of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair marketable equity securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on marketable equity securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items and discrete tax items
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of marketable equity securities and other investments.

Departure of Director
On July 18, 2011, after almost 20 years of service, Michael R. Hallman decided to retire from the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit"). He will not stand for re-election at Intuit's annual meeting of stockholders in January 2012 and will continue to serve on the Board until that time.
In recognition of the many years of commitment and service provided by Mr. Hallman, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board (the "Committee") approved the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs") for 1,854 shares awarded to Mr. Hallman on January 20, 2011, that would have been unvested as of Intuit's next annual meeting. The RSUs will become fully vested on the earlier of (i) the day immediately prior to Intuit's next annual meeting or (ii) the day immediately prior to Mr. Hallman's final day on the Board. Based on Intuit's closing stock price of $47.79 on July 20, 2011, the value of the accelerated RSUs would be approximately $88,603.
Approval of Fiscal Year 2011 Bonus Awards and Fiscal Year 2012 Base Salaries
On July 19, 2011, the Committee certified that the performance goal established for Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") for the year ended July 31, 2011 ("Fiscal 2011") had been achieved and subsequently approved annual performance bonuses for Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Daniel R. Maurer, Kiran M. Patel and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on a review of the performance of each eligible individual and on the Company's revenue and non-GAAP operating income for Fiscal 2011.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the bonus and annual base salary approved for the specified individuals.
 
Approval of 2012 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 19, 2011, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2012 (the "IPI"), a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal year 2012 will be based upon the individual employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal year 2012, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal year 2012 based on overall performance of Intuit. A copy of the IPI for fiscal year 2012 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01.
 
In June 2011, Laura A. Fennell, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 10,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2005. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Ms. Fennell's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices before the options expire in July 2012.
This plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
Transactions under this plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.

CEO Perspective
"We had a strong fourth quarter and a great fiscal year, building on tough year-over-year comparisons of double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2010," said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. "Our results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is working and our execution is on track. Our core businesses, Consumer Tax and Small Business, which represent the majority of our revenue and operating income, both posted double-digit growth in fiscal year 2011.
"As we've seen throughout the recession and recent turbulent market conditions, our portfolio, combined with our focus on execution, helps us to be resilient in the most challenging environments. Through it all, we continue to benefit from customers' ongoing move to connected services. While we still face challenges from the economy, shifting competitors' strategies and new entrants, we're confident that the secular shift to digital services will enable us to deliver strong performance in almost any environment.
"Looking ahead, our plans have assumed no improvement to economic conditions in the coming year. We will continue to apply the same decision principles that have served us well as we've navigated this downturn. We expect to expand operating margins while investing in long term growth. We are looking forward to fiscal 2012. With the right strategy, financial discipline and focused team, we expect another strong year," Smith said.
Business Segment Results and Highlights
Total revenue grew 10 percent for the quarter and 12 percent for the year, with all three divisions growing revenue double digits in fiscal year 2011. Within Small Business:

Stock Repurchase Program
During the fourth quarter, Intuit repurchased $250 million of its shares, bringing total repurchases to nearly $1.4 billion for fiscal 2011.
With $640 million remaining on the current authorization, Intuit's board of directors approved a new $2 billion stock repurchase program, authorized through August 2014. The three-year window provides the flexibility to maintain an active stock repurchase program while also investing for growth.
CFO Perspective
"Intuit is guided by a set of rigorous financial principles. First and foremost, we intend to grow organic revenue double digits and expand operating margin. We deploy cash to the highest-yield opportunities, including internal innovation, acquisitions and partnerships," said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer.
"Beyond that we look for opportunities to return cash to shareholders through our ongoing share repurchase program, and now by offering a cash dividend. Our ability to generate strong cash flow consistently, even in adverse economic environments, gives us confidence that we can continue to invest for growth as well as return cash to shareholders."

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E.

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2010 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 18, 2011, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
 
 
 
 
The accompanying press release dated August 18, 2011 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share:
 
 
 
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items and discrete tax items
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Snapshot of First Quarter Results
 
Dollars are in millions, except EPS.
Intuit typically posts a seasonal loss in its first fiscal quarter when there is little revenue from its tax businesses but expenses continue at relatively consistent levels.
CEO Perspective
"We're off to another strong start in fiscal 2012, growing revenue double-digits. Growth was led by our Small Business Group, which has now posted double-digit growth for seven consecutive quarters," said Brad Smith, president and chief executive officer. "Across the board our first-quarter results are in line with our expectations, so we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2012.
"Our business is growing despite a volatile macroeconomic environment, because we benefit from secular tailwinds. The long-term structural shift to connected services is overpowering the cyclical uncertainty weighing down the economy. Intuit also benefits from enriching the mix for our base of 50 million customers who are rapidly adopting connected services, which generate recurring revenue streams and favorable lifetime value economics for Intuit.
"Our results in the first quarter reinforce that our strategy is working and give us confidence as we head into the remainder of our fiscal year. We are in a digital jet stream, as consumers and small businesses increasingly demand access to applications anytime, anywhere and on any device. That demand will only get stronger as the proliferation of mobile devices continues. If we do our job well, and continue to innovate, we will benefit from these ongoing trends for a long time to come."

Quarterly Dividend
Intuit paid its first quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, or $45 million, in the first quarter. In November the company's board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share to be paid on Jan. 18, 2012 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 10.
Stock Repurchase Program
During the first quarter, Intuit repurchased $255 million of its shares. At the end of the quarter the company had authorization from its board of directors to use up to an additional $2.4 billion for stock repurchases through August 2014.
CFO Perspective
"We've consistently delivered strong total Small Business Group revenue results, which are benefiting from the ongoing shift from desktop to online services," said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer.
"Approximately 70 percent of small business customers now enter the Intuit franchise through a connected service, including QuickBooks Online and other services, up from 40 percent in 2008.
We expect the rapid adoption of connected services to continue in small business and across all of our businesses. Today, we reported that our first quarter fiscal 2012 loss narrowed significantly compared to the first quarter of last year, which reinforces the benefit of the shift to more recurring, reliable connected services revenue."

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the accompanying Table B and Table E as well as the section titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures." A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; expectations regarding growth from digital services and from current or future products and services; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2012; and all of the statements under the heading "Forward-Looking Guidance."
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems
Intuit First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings

may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 17, 2011, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.
 
 
 
 
 
See "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" immediately following Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.

The accompanying press release dated November 17, 2011 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
 
 
 
 
 
 
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share:
 
 
 
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuit's operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Share-based compensation expenses
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Income tax effects of excluded items and discrete tax items
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Amendment of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") held on January 19, 2012, Intuit's stockholders approved an amendment to Intuit's Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). The amendment was approved by Intuit's Board of Directors, subject to the approval of Intuit's stockholders, and became effective with such stockholder approval on January 19, 2012.
As a result of such stockholder approval, the Plan was amended to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan by 4,000,000 shares (from 16,800,000 shares to 20,800,000 shares).
A more complete description of the terms of the Plan and the material amendments and modifications thereto can be found in "Proposal No. 3 - Approval of An Amendment to The Employee Stock Purchase Plan" (pages 64 through 67) in Intuit's definitive proxy statement dated November 23, 2011, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 23, 2011. The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 99.01 to the S-8 Registration Statement filed by Intuit on January 20, 2012.
 
Intuit's Annual Meeting of Stockholders was held on January 19, 2012. At the meeting, stockholders:
 
 
 
 
 
Set forth below, with respect to each such matter, are the number of votes cast for or against, the number of abstentions and the number of broker non-votes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As disclosed above, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders voted on an advisory basis, to hold an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every year, which also was the recommendation of Intuit's Board of Directors. Consistent with this result, Intuit intends to hold an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation on an annual basis until the next required vote on the frequency of advisory votes, or until the Board of Directors otherwise determines that a different frequency for these votes is in the best interests of Intuit's stockholders.
 
In December 2011, Scott D. Cook, founder and board member of Intuit Inc., adopted a stock trading plan on behalf of his family trust, of which he is a trustee, to sell up to 800,000 shares of Intuit common stock and contribute up to 80,000 additional shares to the Valhalla Charitable Foundation between February 2012 and December 2012. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, Mr. Cook's family trust will periodically sell up to 800,000 shares and contribute up to 80,000 shares to the charitable foundation provided certain limit prices are reached.
In December, 2011, Brad D. Smith, Chief Executive Officer, President and board member of Intuit Inc., adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 260,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in June and July 2005. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Smith's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices before the options expire in June and July 2012.
In January 2012, Kiran M. Patel, Executive Vice President of Intuit Inc., adopted a stock trading plan related to the exercise and sale of up to 125,000 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under options granted in 2006 and 2007. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically exercise Mr. Patel's stock options and sell the issued shares at predetermined minimum prices between February 2012 and March 2013.
These plans are intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and were adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
Transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
The Valhalla Charitable Foundation also adopted a stock trading plan in December 2011 to sell up to 80,000 shares of Intuit stock contributed by Mr. Cook's family trust during the same period provided certain limit prices are reached.

Dollars are in millions, except earnings per share (EPS). See About Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information regarding financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Company Perspective
We had a strong second quarter and have built solid momentum through the first half of the fiscal year, with revenue growing double-digits, driven by our core businesses. We are on track to deliver the revenue guidance we set for the full year, and we raised our guidance for fiscal 2012 operating income and EPS, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer.
We are off to a great start in tax. Early indications are positive and we are pleased with how the business is performing so far. Third-party data and our unit sales through Feb. 18 give us confidence that the software category is growing and that we are executing well.
Longer term, our strategy remains the same, and our opportunity to grow customers and revenue by converting non-consumption across our businesses has never been stronger as customers continue to shift to digital solutions and mobile devices, Smith said.
Quarterly Business Segment Results and Highlights

CFO Perspective
    
The shift to online offerings is accelerating across the company, said Neil Williams, chief financial officer. That shows up in the financial results we released today and demonstrates that our strategy is working. This secular shift to digital solutions is also good news for customer acquisition and continues to enrich our mix, as connected services generate recurring revenue streams and favorable lifetime value economics for Intuit.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure,
Intuit Second Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings

and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the accompanying Table B and Table E as well as the section titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures." A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; expectations regarding growth from digital services and from current or future products and services; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2012; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-Looking Guidance.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 21, 2012, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated February 21, 2012 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On February 17, 2012, Intuit Inc. ("Intuit") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a new five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million by and among Intuit, the Lenders parties thereto (the "Lenders"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMCB"), as administrative agent, U.S. Bank National Association and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as co-syndication agents for the Lenders, and Union Bank, N.A., as documentation agent. The Credit Agreement replaces Intuit's $500 million Five Year Credit Agreement, entered into on March 22, 2007, which was due to expire on March 22, 2012 and was terminated as of February 17, 2012.
The Credit Agreement provides for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Facility") that will expire on February 17, 2017. Borrowings under the Facility will accrue interest at rates equal, at Intuit's election, to JPMCB's alternate base rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.00% to 0.50% or to the adjusted London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.90% to 1.50%, in each case with the applicable margin based on Intuit's senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Intuit will also pay an annual commitment fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which may vary depending on its senior debt credit ratings. Up to $100 million of the Facility is available to Intuit in specified foreign currencies.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by Intuit's subsidiaries and limitations on incurrence of liens. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that Intuit maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and a ratio of consolidated annual EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.
The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.
Intuit will use amounts borrowed under the Facility for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. Intuit is not borrowing under the Facility at this time, but may borrow under the Facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise.
Some of the Lenders and their affiliates have various relationships with Intuit and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business involving the provision of financial services, including cash management, commercial banking, investment banking or other services.
The foregoing description of the Credit Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, which will be filed with Intuit's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2012.
ITEM 1.02 TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On February 17, 2012, Intuit terminated its existing $500 million Five Year Credit Agreement as described in Item 1.01 above, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.02.
ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
On February 17, 2012, Intuit entered into the Credit Agreement described in Item 1.01 above, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.

Snapshot of Year-to-date Results
 
Dollars are in millions, except earnings per share (EPS). See About Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information regarding financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Company Perspective
Small business and consumer tax delivered 11 percent revenue growth year to date - a solid performance overall, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer.
In tax, we continue to be at the center of the shift to digital tax preparation. The digital category grew 5 percent this year, significantly faster than any other method, but slower than we had planned. With the tax season over, we'll assess our main growth drivers and apply that knowledge as we look toward next tax season.
Our largest business, the small business group, delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter. Connected services and mobile offerings continue to gain momentum as more small businesses turn to the cloud.
Long-term, as consumers and small businesses continue to adopt technology, our opportunity to innovate and convert non-consumption remains strong and I remain confident in our strategy and opportunities for growth, Smith said.
Quarterly Business Segment Results and Highlights
Total
Small Business Group revenue grew 11 percent, led by strength in Employee Management Solutions and Payment Solutions.

CFO Perspective
We took several steps to evolve our portfolio in the third quarter, which included several transactions in line with our broader financial principles, said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer. Our pending purchase of Demandforce and the acquisition of AisleBuyer will strengthen our small business segment. We also took steps to address nonstrategic assets with the sale of our corporate banking business to Bottomline Technologies. This transaction will help the Financial Services team focus on innovating for consumers and small businesses.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the accompanying Table B and Table E as well as the section titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures." A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; expectations regarding growth from connected services, mobile offerings and from other current or future products and services; expectations regarding the ability to convert non-consumption; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future
Intuit Third Quarter 2012 Earnings

dividends or share repurchases; the impact of acquisitions and divestitures on its business; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2012; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-Looking Guidance.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of May 17, 2012, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated May 17, 2012 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Approval of Fiscal Year 2012 Bonus Awards and Fiscal Year 2013 Base Salaries
On July 24, 2012, the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee (the "Committee") certified that the performance goal established for Intuit's Senior Executive Incentive Plan ("SEIP") for the year ended July 31, 2012 ("Fiscal 2012") had been achieved and subsequently approved annual performance bonuses for Brad D. Smith, R. Neil Williams, Kiran M. Patel, Laura A. Fennell, Daniel R. Maurer, and Scott D. Cook. The specific bonus amounts were determined by the Committee based on a review of the performance of each eligible individual and on the Company's revenue and non-GAAP operating income for Fiscal 2012.
The Committee also approved the annual base salaries for Intuit's executive officers for the next fiscal year. The following table sets forth the bonus and annual base salary approved for the specified individuals.
 
Approval of Amendment to the Intuit Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan
On July 24, 2012, the Committee approved amendment of the Intuit Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan in order to provide for dividend equivalents with respect to restricted stock units granted after the approval of the amendment. A copy of the Intuit Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended through July 24, 2012 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.01.
Approval of 2013 Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan
On July 24, 2012, the Committee approved the Intuit Inc. Performance Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2013 (the "IPI"), a discretionary cash bonus plan. The amount of a bonus award under the IPI for fiscal year 2013 will be based upon the individual employee's bonus target, the employee's performance during fiscal year 2013, and the amount of the aggregate bonus pool that is made available for bonuses for fiscal year 2013 based on overall performance of Intuit. A copy of the IPI for fiscal year 2013 is attached to this Report as Exhibit 10.02.
 
In May 2012, Laura A. Fennell, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Intuit, adopted a stock trading plan related to the sale of up to 29,232 shares of Intuit common stock issuable under various restricted stock unit awards granted in 2009. Subject to the terms and conditions of this plan, a brokerage firm may periodically sell the vested and issued shares at predetermined minimum prices through December 31, 2012.
This plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act and was adopted in accordance with Intuit's policies regarding securities transactions. Rule 10b5-1 permits individuals who are not in possession of material, non-public information at the time the plan is adopted to establish pre-arranged plans to buy or sell company stock.
Transactions under this plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the extent required by law.
 
 
 
 
SIGNATURE
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.01
. The purpose of the Plan is to provide incentives to attract, retain and motivate eligible persons whose present and potential contributions are important to the success of the Company and its Subsidiaries by offering them an opportunity to participate in the Company's future performance through awards of Options, Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), Restricted Stock Awards, and Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). Capitalized terms not defined in the text are defined in Section 27.
1.
PURPOSE
2. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.
2.1. .
Number of Shares Available
(a) The aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan is 96,000,000 Shares, subject to adjustment as provided elsewhere in the Plan ("Share Reserve").
(b) Each Share subject to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall reduce the Share Reserve by one Share. Each Share subject to Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall reduce the Share Reserve by two and three-tenths (2.3) Shares. Shares that are subject to Awards that (i) have been canceled or forfeited, or have expired, (ii) have ceased to be subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right for any reason other than exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (iii) are repurchased or reacquired by the Company from the Participant at the Participant's original purchase price (if any), (iv) are otherwise not issued under an Award, or (v) are settled in cash shall not reduce the Share Reserve. Shares that again become available for grant under the Plan pursuant to the foregoing sentence shall be added back to the Share Reserve as one (1) Share if such Shares were subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, and as two and three-tenths (2.3) Shares if such Shares were subject to Awards other than Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan. The rules described in the preceding sentences of this Section 2.1(b) regarding counting Shares for the purposes of both reducing and adding back to the Share Reserve shall apply to all Awards effective on and after November 1, 2010, including Awards that are outstanding on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Shares subject to an Award under the Plan may not again become available for grant under the Plan if such Shares are: (i) used to pay the exercise price of an Option, (ii) Shares that were subject to a stock-settled Stock Appreciation Right and were not issued upon the net settlement or net exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right, (iii) delivered to or withheld by the Company to pay the withholding taxes related to an Award, or (iv) repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of an Option exercise or other acquisition of Shares under the terms of an Award.
(c) The Company may issue Shares that are authorized but unissued Shares or treasury Shares, including Shares repurchased by the Company, whether directly from a Participant pursuant to the terms of Awards granted under the Plan or on the open market.
(d) At all times the Company will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Shares to satisfy the requirements of all outstanding Awards granted under the Plan.
2.2. . If the outstanding Shares are affected by a merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation, stock dividend, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, combination, reclassification, split-up, spin-off, share combination, share exchange, extraordinary dividend or distribution of cash, property and/or securities, or other change in the capital structure of the Company, an adjustment shall be made in (a) the number of Shares (or other securities or property) reserved for issuance under the Plan and the limits that are set forth in Section 2.3; (b) the Exercise Prices of and number of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to outstanding Options and SARs; (c) the number of Shares (or other securities or property) subject to other outstanding Awards, and (d) any performance conditions relating to Awards granted under the Plan, as shall be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee, exercising its authority under Section 4 of the Plan, for the purpose of
Adjustment of Shares
preventing the dilution or enlargement of rights and privileges under the terms of the Plan or any outstanding Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, fractions of a Share (or other security) will not be issued but will either be replaced by a cash payment equal to the Fair Market Value of such fraction of a Share (or other security) or will be rounded to a whole Share (or other security), as determined by the Committee and as permitted under Section 424(a) of the Code.
2.3. . The aggregate number of Shares subject to Awards granted under this Plan in any fiscal year to any one Participant shall not exceed 4,000,000 Shares, other than new employees of the Company or of any Subsidiary, who are eligible to receive up to a maximum of 6,000,000 Shares issuable under Awards granted in the calendar year in which they commence their employment. The aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs under this Plan shall not exceed 96,000,000 Shares.
Section 162(m) Award Limits and ISO Limit
2.4. . In the event that the Company acquires or combines with another company and grants Awards under the Plan in assumption or substitution of outstanding equity awards of such company, the number of Shares authorized for issuance under this Plan shall be increased to the extent necessary to satisfy such assumed or substituted awards (based on the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of the equity securities of the acquired company, and in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code), and the issuance of Shares pursuant to such assumed or substituted awards shall not reduce the Shares otherwise authorized for issuance under the Plan.
Assumed or Substituted Awards of Acquired Companies
. ISOs may be granted only to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees) of the Company or of a Subsidiary. All other Awards may be granted to employees (including officers and directors who are also employees) or other individuals who are Non-Employee Directors, consultants or advisors of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided that such consultants or advisors render bona fide services not in connection with the offer and sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction and do not directly or indirectly promote or maintain a market for the Company's securities. The Committee (or its designee under Section 4.1(c)) will from time to time determine and designate among the eligible persons who will be granted one or more Awards under the Plan. A person may be granted more than one Award under the Plan.
3. ELIGIBILITY
4. ADMINISTRATION.
4.1. . The Plan shall be administered by the Committee; provided, however, that any power of the Committee also may be exercised by the Board, except to the extent that the grant or exercise of such authority would cause any Award or transaction to (i) become subject to (or lose an exemption under) Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, (ii) cause an Award intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code to fail to satisfy such requirements, or (iii) fail to satisfy Rule 5605(d) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules (or any successor to such rule or other comparable rule as to which the Company may be required to comply). The Committee will have full power to implement and carry out the Plan and the purposes of the Plan, subject to the terms of the Plan, including but not limited to the authority to:
Committee Authority
(a) construe and interpret the Plan, any Award Agreement and any other agreement or document executed pursuant to the Plan or relating to the administration or operation of the Plan;
(b) prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award, including determining forms and agreements used in connection with the Plan; provided that the Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or the officer in charge of Human Resources, the authority to approve revisions to the forms and agreements used in connection with the Plan that are designed to facilitate Plan administration both domestically and abroad, and that are not inconsistent with the Plan or with any resolutions of the Committee relating to the Plan;
(c) select persons to receive Awards; provided that the Committee may delegate to one or more individuals who would be considered "officers" under Section 157(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware the authority to grant an Award under the Plan to Participants who are not Insiders within such limit of the total number of Awards which may be granted by such officers established by resolution of the Committee;
(d) determine the terms of Awards;
(e) determine the number of Shares or other consideration subject to Awards;
(f) determine whether Awards will be granted singly, in combination, or in tandem with, in replacement of, or as alternatives to, other Awards under the Plan or any other incentive or compensation plan of the Company or any Subsidiary;
(g) grant waivers of Plan or Award conditions, including, without limitation, (i) the satisfaction of performance goals under Awards intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code in the event of death, Disability, or a Corporate Transaction, or (ii) the waiver of the termination provisions applicable to Options under Section 5.6(b));
(h) determine the vesting, exercisability, transferability, and payment of Awards, including the authority to accelerate the vesting of Awards;
(i) correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement;
(j) determine whether an Award has been earned;
(k) establish subplans for the grant of Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or are employed outside the U.S., which subplans may provide for different terms and conditions applicable to Awards if necessary or desirable to recognize differences in local law or tax policy;
(l) amend the Plan; and
(m) make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.
4.2. . Any determination made by the Committee with respect to any Award pursuant to Section 4.1 above shall be made in its sole discretion at the time of grant of the Award or, unless in contravention of any express term of the Plan or Award, at any later time, and such determination shall be final and binding on the Company and all persons having an interest in any Award under the Plan. Any dispute regarding the interpretation of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be submitted by the Participant or Company to the Committee for review. The resolution of such a dispute by the Committee shall be final and binding on the Company and Participant. The Committee may delegate to one or more individuals who would be considered "officers" under Section 157(c) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware the authority to review and resolve disputes with respect to Awards held by Participants who are not Insiders, and such resolution shall be final and binding on the Company and Participant. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, administration of the Plan shall at all times be limited by the requirement that any administrative action or exercise of discretion shall be void (or suitably modified when possible) if necessary to avoid the application to any Participant of immediate taxation and/or tax penalties or additional taxes under Section 409A of the Code.
Committee Interpretation and Discretion
The Committee may grant Options to eligible persons and will determine (a) whether the Options will be ISOs or NQSOs; (b) the number of Shares subject to the Option, (c) the Exercise Price of the Option, (d) the period during which the Option may be exercised, and (e) all other terms and conditions of the Option, subject to the provisions of this Section 5 and the Plan.
5. OPTIONS.
5.1. . Each Option granted under the Plan will be evidenced by a Stock Option Agreement that will expressly identify the Option as an ISO or NQSO. The Stock Option Agreement will be substantially in a form and contain such provisions (which need not be the same for each Participant) that the Committee or an officer of the Company (pursuant to Section 4.1(b)) has from time to time approved, and will comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan.
Form of Option Grant
5.2. . The date of grant of an Option will be the date on which the Committee makes the determination and completes all necessary action on its part to grant the Option, unless a later date is otherwise specified by the Committee. The Stock Option Agreement, and a copy of the Plan and the current Prospectus for the Plan (plus any additional documents required to be delivered under applicable laws), will be delivered to the Participant within a reasonable time after the Option is granted. The Stock Option Agreement, the Plan, the Prospectus and other documents may be delivered in any manner (including electronic distribution or posting) that meets applicable legal requirements.
Date of Grant
5.3. . An Option will become vested and exercisable as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Stock Option Agreement governing such Option, subject to the provisions of Section 5.6, and subject to Company policies established by the Committee (or by individuals to whom the Committee has delegated responsibility) from time to time with respect to vesting during leaves of absences. An Option may be granted to allow for its exercisability prior to vesting. Vesting of an Option may be based upon completion of a specified period of service with the Company, the attainment of pre-established performance goals, or such other factors as the Committee determines. The Stock Option Agreement governing such Option shall set forth the last date that the Option may be exercised (the ""), and may provide for automatic exercise of the Option on such Expiration Date if the Exercise Price per Share is less than the Fair Market Value per Share on such Expiration Date and the Participant has not previously exercised the Option, or may provide that in the event that trading in the Company's stock is prohibited by law, the term of the Option automatically shall be extended until the date that is 30 days after such prohibition is lifted, to the extent that such extension does not cause the Participant to become subject to taxation under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Option will be exercisable after seven years from the date the Option is granted; provided that no ISO granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder will be exercisable after five years from the date the Option is granted.

Procedures for Exercise
5.6. .
Termination of Employment
(a) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.6(a), an Option will cease to vest on the Participant's Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Option granted to a Participant who is an employee who has been actively employed by the Company or any Subsidiary for one year or more or who is a director, will vest as to 100% of the Shares subject to such Option if the Participant is Terminated due to Disability or death, unless otherwise provided in such Participant's Stock Option Agreement. In addition, any Option held by an employee who is Terminated by the Company, or any Subsidiary, within one year following the date of a Corporate Transaction will immediately vest as to such number of Shares as the Participant would have been vested in twelve months after the date of Termination had the Participant remained employed for that twelve month period, unless otherwise provided in such employee's Stock Option Agreement.
Vesting
(b) . Following a Participant's Termination, any unvested portion of the Participant's Option shall terminate, and any vested portion of the Participant's Option may be exercised during the periods set forth below, after which it automatically shall terminate:
Post-Termination Exercise Period
(i) no later than 90 days after the Termination Date if a Participant is Terminated for any reason except death or Disability, unless a longer time period, not exceeding five years, is specifically set forth in the Participant's Stock Option Agreement; provided that no Option may be exercised after the Expiration Date of the Option; or
(ii) no later than (A) twelve months after the Termination Date in the case of Termination due to Disability or (B) eighteen months after the Termination Date in the case of Termination due to death or if a Participant dies within three months after the Termination Date, unless a longer time period, not exceeding five years, is specifically set forth in the Participant's Stock Option Agreement; provided that no Option may be exercised after the Expiration Date of the Option.
5.7. . The Committee may specify a reasonable minimum number of Shares that may be purchased on any exercise of an Option; provided that the minimum number will not prevent a Participant from exercising an Option for the full number of Shares for which it is then exercisable.
Limitations on Exercise
5.8. . The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant) of Shares with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year (under the Plan or any compensatory stock plan of the Company or any parent or Subsidiary under which ISOs may be granted) shall not exceed $100,000. If the Fair Market Value of Shares on the date of grant with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, the Options for the first $100,000 worth of Shares to become exercisable in that calendar year will be ISOs, and the Options for the Shares with a Fair Market Value in excess of $100,000 that become exercisable in that calendar year will be NQSOs. If the Code is amended to provide for a different limit on the Fair Market Value of Shares permitted to be subject to ISOs, such different limit shall be automatically incorporated into the Plan and will apply to any Options granted after the effective date of the Code's amendment.
Limitations on ISOs
5.9. . If a Participant sells or otherwise disposes of any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO on or before the later of (a) the date two years after the Date of Grant, and (b) the date one year after the exercise of the ISO (in either case, a ""), the Company may require the Participant to immediately notify the Company in writing of such Disqualifying Disposition.
Notice of Disqualifying Dispositions of Shares Acquired on Exercise of an ISO
Disqualifying Disposition
5.10. . The Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options and authorize the grant of new Options in substitution therefor; provided that any such action may not, without the written consent of the Participant, materially impair any of the Participant's rights under any Option previously granted; and provided, further that without stockholder approval, the
Modification, Extension or Renewal
Committee may not reduce the Exercise Price of any outstanding Option. Any outstanding ISO that is modified, extended, renewed or otherwise altered shall be treated in accordance with Section 424(h) of the Code.
5.11. . Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, no term of the Plan relating to ISOs will be interpreted, amended or altered, and no discretion or authority granted under the Plan will be exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code or, without the consent of the Participant affected, to disqualify any ISO under Section 422 of the Code.
No Disqualification

If the Restricted Stock Award is to be earned upon the satisfaction of performance goals, the Committee shall: (a) determine the nature, length and starting date of any performance period for the Award; (b) select the performance goals, which may include one or more Performance Factors; and (c) determine the number of Shares that may be awarded to the Participant. Prior to the time that restrictions are lifted with respect to one or more Shares subject to a Restricted Stock Award as a result of satisfaction of the service or performance goals, the Committee may require that the Shares be held by the Company under the terms of an escrow or similar arrangements according to terms determined by the Company and as described further in Section 15 below. The Committee may adjust the performance goals applicable to a Restricted Stock Award during a Performance Period in the manner described in Section 9.3(b) below.

9. QUALIFYING PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION.
9.1. . The Committee may establish performance criteria and level of achievement versus such criteria that shall determine the number of Shares to be granted, retained, vested, issued or issuable under or in settlement of or the amount payable pursuant to an Award, which criteria may be based on Qualifying Performance Criteria or other standards of the performance of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any portion thereof and/or personal performance factors. In addition, the Committee may specify that an Award or a portion of an Award is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, provided that the performance criteria for such Award or portion of an Award that is intended by the Committee to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be a measure based on one or more Qualifying Performance Criteria selected by the Committee and specified at the time the Award is granted. Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of Shares issued under or the amount paid under an Award may be reduced, but, in the case of any Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, not increased, by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as the Committee in its sole discretion shall determine.
General
9.2. . In the case of any Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall establish the performance goals with respect to such Award not later than ninety (90) days after the commencement of the period of service to which the performance goal relates (or, in the case of performance periods of less than one year, not later than the date upon which 25% of the performance period elapses), provided that the outcome of the performance goal is substantially uncertain at such time.
Establishment of Performance Goals
9.3. .
Qualifying Performance Criteria

9.4. . The Committee shall certify, in writing, the extent to which any Qualifying Performance Criteria has been satisfied, and the amount payable as a result thereof, prior to payment, settlement or vesting of any Award that is intended to satisfy the requirements for "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code.

In other circumstances triggering a withholding tax liability for the Company or any Subsidiary, the Participant shall be required to make adequate arrangements to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, whether out of the value of the Award or otherwise. The Company may provide for further details regarding a Participant's satisfaction of any such withholding tax liability in the Award Agreements, which need not be the same for all Participants or for all Awards of a particular type.

When, under applicable tax laws, a Participant incurs tax liability in connection with the grant, issuance, modification, exercise, lapse of restrictions or vesting of any Award or other circumstances relating to any Award that is subject to tax withholding and the Participant is obligated to pay the Company the amount required to be withheld, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, allow the Participant to satisfy the minimum withholding tax obligation by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued that number of whole Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld, determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in accordance with the requirements established by the Committee and be in writing (including an electronic writing) in a form acceptable to the Committee.
Stock Withholding
.No Participant or Authorized Transferee will have any rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares until the Shares are issued to the Participant or Authorized Transferee. After Shares are issued to the Participant or Authorized Transferee, the Participant or Authorized Transferee will be a stockholder and have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares, including the right to vote and receive all dividends or other distributions made or paid with respect to such Shares; provided, however, that if the Shares are subject to any vesting requirements or similar restrictions, any new, additional or different securities the Participant or Authorized Transferee may become entitled to receive with respect to the Shares by virtue of a stock dividend, stock split or any other change in the corporate or capital structure of the Company, as described in further detail in Section 2.2, as well as any dividends or distributions made with respect to such Shares, will be subject to the same restrictions as the Shares themselves.

Transfers by the Participant for consideration are prohibited.
13.
TRANSFERABILITY
. All certificates for Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan (whether in physical or electronic form, as appropriate) will be subject to stock transfer orders, legends and other restrictions that the Committee deems necessary or advisable, including without limitation, restrictions under any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law, or any rules, regulations and other requirements of the SEC or any stock exchange or other public securities market on which the Shares may be listed.
14.

. To enforce any restrictions on a Participant's Shares, the Committee may require the Participant to deposit all certificates representing Shares, together with stock powers or other transfer instruments approved by the Committee, appropriately endorsed in blank, with the Company or an agent designated by the Company, to hold in escrow until such restrictions have lapsed or terminated, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends referencing such restrictions to be placed on the certificates.
15.
ESCROW
. An Award shall not be effective unless the Award is in compliance with all applicable state, federal and foreign securities laws, rules and regulations of any governmental body, and the requirements of any stock exchange or other public securities market on which the Shares may then be listed, as they are in effect on the date of grant of the Award and also on the date of exercise or other issuance. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver certificates for Shares under the Plan prior to (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable, and/or (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any state, federal or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. The Company shall be under no obligation to register the Shares with the SEC or to effect compliance with the registration, qualification or listing requirements of any state, federal or foreign securities laws, stock exchange or automated quotation system, and the Company shall have no liability for any inability or failure to do so.

17.
NO OBLIGATION TO EMPLOY
. The repricing of Options or SARs (, the reduction of Exercise Price) is prohibited without prior stockholder approval. The Committee may, at any time or from time to time, authorize the Company, with prior stockholder approval, in the case of an exchange of Options or SARs, and the consent of the respective Participants, to issue new Awards in exchange for the surrender and cancellation of any or all outstanding Awards. The Committee may at any time buy from a Participant an Option or SAR previously granted with payment in cash, Shares or other consideration, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee and the Participant shall agree; provided, however, that in no event will an Option with an Exercise Price above the Fair Market Value at the time of such proposed buyout be repurchased without prior stockholder approval.
18.

i.e.
19. CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS.

In the alternative, the successor may substitute equivalent Awards or provide substantially similar consideration to Participants as was provided to stockholders (after taking into account the existing provisions of the Awards). The successor may also issue, in place of outstanding Shares held by the Participant, substantially similar shares, other securities or other property subject to repurchase restrictions no less favorable to the Participant. In the event such successor, if any, refuses to assume, replace or substitute the Awards, as provided above, pursuant to a Corporate Transaction or if there is no successor due to a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, such Awards shall immediately vest as to 100% of the Shares subject thereto at such time and on such conditions as the Board shall determine and the Awards shall expire at the closing of the transaction or at the time of dissolution or liquidation. If a successor decides to assume, replace or substitute all then outstanding Awards, such successor shall not be required to treat all then outstanding Awards in the same fashion.
Assumption or Replacement of Awards by Successor
19.2. . Subject to any greater rights granted to Participants under Section 19.1, in the event of a Corporate Transaction, any outstanding Awards shall be treated as provided in the applicable agreement or plan of merger, consolidation, acquisition, dissolution, liquidation or sale of assets.
Other Treatment of Awards
19.3. . The Company, from time to time, also may substitute, replace or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or otherwise, by either (a) granting an Award under the Plan in substitution of such other company's award, or (b) assuming such award as if it had been granted under the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under the Plan. In the event the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award shall remain unchanged (except that in the case of an option or stock appreciation right, the exercise price and the number and nature of Shares issuable upon exercise of such option or stock appreciation right will be adjusted appropriately in a manner not inconsistent with Section 424(a) of the Code), unless determined otherwise by the Committee. In the event the Company elects to grant a new Option or SAR rather than assuming an existing option, such new Option or SAR may be granted with a similarly adjusted Exercise Price.
Assumption of Awards by the Company
This Amendment and Restatement of the Plan as set forth herein was approved by the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee on July 24, 2012.
20. ADOPTION.
The Plan will terminate on January 19, 2015, unless extended beyond such date by stockholder approval.
21. TERM OF PLAN.
The Board may at any time terminate or amend the Plan in any respect, including without limitation, amendment of any Award Agreement or instrument to be executed pursuant to the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Board nor the Committee shall, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, amend the Plan in any manner, including reducing the exercise price of an Option or SAR, that requires such stockholder approval pursuant to the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder or pursuant to the Exchange Act or any rule promulgated thereunder or pursuant to the listing requirements of the national securities market on which the Shares are listed. In addition, no amendment that would materially impair the rights of a Participant under an outstanding Award may be made without the consent of the Participant. Unless otherwise provided, an Award shall be governed by the version of the Plan in effect at the time such Award was granted.
22. AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF PLAN.
Neither the adoption of the Plan by the Board, the submission of the Plan to the stockholders of the Company for approval, nor any provision of the Plan shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such additional compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options and bonuses otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases. The Plan shall be unfunded and no Participant shall have any claim on any particular assets or securities of the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor the Board shall be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by Awards made pursuant to the Plan. Neither the Company, the Committee, nor the Board shall be deemed to be a trustee of any amounts to be paid under the Plan.
23. NONEXCLUSIVITY OF THE PLAN; UNFUNDED PLAN.
Neither the Company nor any parent or Subsidiary that is in existence or hereafter comes into existence shall be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance or sale of Shares as to which the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder; and (ii) any tax consequence expected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Award granted hereunder.
24. NO LIABILITY OF COMPANY.
This Plan and any Award Agreement or other agreements or documents hereunder shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to the Plan or any Award Agreement will be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in Santa Clara County in the State of California.
25. GOVERNING LAW.
In the event that the Company issues a restatement of its financial results after the distribution of Shares or cash upon settlement of an Award whose vesting was conditioned on the achievement of performance goals, which restatement decreases the level of achievement of the goals from the level(s) previously determined by the Committee, then the Participant will be required to deliver to the Company, within 30 days after receipt of written notification by the Company, an amount in cash or equivalent value in Shares (or a combination of the two) equal to the net proceeds realized by the Participant on the settlement of the Award and, if applicable, subsequent sale of any Shares that would not have vested or been issued based on the restated financial results. This Section 26 only will apply to a Participant if it is determined by the Committee in good faith that fraud or misconduct engaged in by the Participant (directly or indirectly) was a significant contributing factor to such restatement of financial results.
26. RECOUPMENT OF AWARDS.
As used in the Plan, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

CEO Perspective
Fiscal 2012 was another strong year for Intuit, with 10 percent revenue growth and earnings per share growth of 16 percent, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. Our results and our outlook reflect the steady strength of our core businesses and Intuit's resilience in the choppy macroeconomic environment.
As consumers and small businesses benefit from our broad and healthy portfolio of offerings, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver double-digit growth with margin expansion.
Intuit is benefitting from a secular shift to digital solutions, and we remain confident about future growth. With the right strategy, a strong portfolio, sound financial discipline and a dedicated team, we expect to deliver another strong year, Smith said.

Intuit repurchased $107 million of its common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, bringing total repurchases for fiscal 2012 to $900 million. At the end of the fiscal year the current authorization had $1.7 billion remaining for stock repurchases through August 2014.
CFO Perspective
Our financial principles and capital allocation strategy remain the same. We target double-digit organic revenue growth while growing revenue faster than expenses, said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer. When it's the best use, we'll return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends.
For fiscal 2013, we're increasing our quarterly dividend by 13 percent. These actions demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we continue to invest for growth as well as return cash to shareholders.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results;  expectations regarding growth from digital services and from current or future products and services; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends and share repurchases; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2013; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-looking Guidance.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be
Intuit Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2012 Earnings
Page 8
adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2011 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of August 21, 2012, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.

See accompanying Notes.
INTUIT INC.
NOTES TO TABLE A
 
 
 
We determined that our Intuit Websites business became a long-lived asset held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. A long-lived asset classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Since the carrying value of Intuit Websites at July 31, 2012 was less than the estimated fair value less cost to sell, no adjustment to the carrying value of this long-lived asset was necessary at that date.
We also determined that our Intuit Websites business became a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and have segregated its operating results in our statements of operations for all periods presented. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was $76 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 and $79 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2011. Net income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended July 31, 2012 includes a net loss from Intuit Websites discontinued operations of $11 million and $36 million in tax benefits from the anticipated sale of this business. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2011 we recorded a net loss from Intuit Websites discontinued operations of $18 million.
Net assets held for sale at July 31, 2012 and July 31, 2011 consisted primarily of operating assets and liabilities that were not material, so we have not segregated them on our balance sheets. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.

See About Non-GAAP Financial Measures immediately following this Table E for information on these measures, the items excluded from the most directly comparable GAAP measures in arriving at non-GAAP financial measures, and the reasons management uses each measure and excludes the specified amounts in arriving at each non-GAAP financial measure.
INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated August 21, 2012 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Snapshot of First-quarter Results
Dollars are in millions, except earnings per share (EPS). See About Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information regarding financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). All figures in the table above have been reclassified to reflect Intuit Websites as discontinued operations and to exclude its results from non-GAAP EPS. GAAP EPS for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 includes a gain of $0.11 on the sale of Intuit Websites.
CEO Perspective
We're off to a strong start in fiscal year 2013. We grew first-quarter revenue 12 percent, and we're reiterating our guidance of double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth for the full fiscal year, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. While we're not completely insulated from the challenges of the macro-environment, we have proven to be resilient, and we continue to execute against principles that guide us through tough times.
We also refreshed our connected services strategy to capitalize on structural shifts occurring in the market that will serve as growth catalysts. Our mobile products are contributing meaningful growth, with around half of our mobile customers new to the franchise, which is expanding our market reach and our category growth.
Looking ahead, we're building on a strong foundation while reimagining our products to capitalize on a rapidly changing environment. With big market opportunities in front of us, and the tailwind of technology adoption at our backs, we expect to deliver strong results for quarters and years to come, Smith said.

Stock Repurchase Program
Intuit repurchased $100 million of its common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. At the end of the quarter the current authorization had $1.6 billion remaining for stock repurchases through August 2014.
CFO Perspective
We delivered a strong financial performance this quarter, with small business reporting customer growth in payments, QuickBooks Online and Demandforce. Our cloud-based subscriptions are really leading the way, said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer. All of our Small Business segments delivered double-digit growth, even with our own and external indicators pointing to slow growth in the sector.
As we've said, the tables are set for late tax legislation, which could impact the availability of tax forms and push Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals revenue from our second fiscal quarter to our third quarter. We've assumed the impact is $50 million to $75 million in revenue and $0.10 to $0.15 in earnings per share. To provide additional transparency into our expected results, we are providing revenue and earnings per share guidance ranges for the third and fourth quarters. said Williams.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; expectations regarding growth from connected services and from current or future products and services; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends and share repurchases; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2013; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-looking Guidance.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting
Intuit First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings
Page 7
information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of November 15, 2012, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.

NOTES TO TABLE A
 
 
 
We determined that Intuit Websites became discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We have therefore segregated the operating results of Intuit Websites from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was $9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2012 and $19 million for the three months ended October 31, 2011.
Net assets held for sale at July 31, 2012 consisted primarily of operating assets and liabilities that were not material, so we have not segregated them on our balance sheets. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated November 15, 2012 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Intuit Updates Second-quarter Outlook
Due to Late Start of Tax Season; Reiterates Full-year Guidance
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -
Feb. 7, 2013
-- Intuit Inc. (Nasdaq: INTU) today announced it expects an additional shift of tax revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP operating income from its second fiscal quarter to its third fiscal quarter due to the late passage of tax legislation and the Internal Revenue Service's delay in opening e-file. The company's second fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31. The third quarter ends April 30. All other business segments performed within Intuit's expectations for the second quarter.
Intuit expects to report second-quarter revenue of $960 million to $965 million; GAAP operating income of $85 million to $90 million; and non-GAAP operating income of $145 million to $150 million.
In a typical year, the IRS begins accepting returns by mid-January. This year the IRS did not begin accepting any returns until Jan. 30, just two days before the end of Intuit's second fiscal quarter.
The late start is not expected to affect full-year revenue or operating income for Intuit or the Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals business segments. Intuit reiterated full-year revenue and operating income guidance. For fiscal year 2013, the company expects revenue growth of 10 to 12 percent; GAAP operating income growth of 12 to 14 percent; and non-GAAP operating income growth of 12 to 14 percent.
"The season began substantively later this year than prior years, but the initial results we've seen in early February give us confidence that we are on track, said Dan Maurer, senior vice president and general manager of Intuit's consumer group.  Early indicators, including Web traffic, are trending in the right direction.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results for the second fiscal quarter of 2013 and the 2013 fiscal year and expected shifts in tax revenue as a result of the late tax legislation.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be

Snapshot of Second-quarter Results
Dollars are in millions, except earnings per share (EPS). See About Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information regarding financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). All figures in the table above have been reclassified to reflect Intuit Websites as discontinued operations and to exclude its results from non-GAAP EPS.
CEO Perspective
Our second-quarter results are in line with our updated outlook, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. Looking at the big picture, we see a secular theme - the adoption of cloud-based services - continuing to drive growth across all of our businesses. Small business subscribers grew double digits in the second quarter and mobile offerings continue to be a catalyst for growth with more than 50 applications across various mobile platforms and devices.
The shift to digital solutions is the driving force behind the tax business as well. While it is very early in the season, initial results from the first few weeks of February and early indicators are giving us confidence we're on track for the season and the fiscal year.
Quarterly shifts aside, we know about 140 million people will have to file taxes by April 15. And we've got a strong game plan to help tax filers keep more of their hard-earned money and receive expert advice when they need it, Smith said.

Quarterly Dividend
Intuit paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share, totaling $51 million, during the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Intuit's board of directors approved a new quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 to be paid on April 18 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 10.
Stock Repurchase Program
Intuit repurchased $100 million of its common stock during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, bringing repurchases to a total of $200 million for the first half of the fiscal year. At the end of the quarter the current authorization had $1.5 billion remaining for stock repurchases through August 2014.
CFO Perspective
Across the company we're benefiting from the tailwinds toward more digital, connected services, said Neil Williams, Intuit's chief financial officer. In Tax and Small Business, the shift to digital solutions continues to add recurring revenue streams and favorable lifetime value economics. With plenty of tax season ahead, we are focused beyond quarterly shifts, looking at the full year. With a proven strategy in place, we are also committed to building the foundation for long-term growth and increased shareholder value.
Forward-looking Guidance
Intuit reiterated revenue and operating income guidance for
full fiscal year 2013
, which ends July 31, and increased EPS guidance for the retroactive extension of the research and development tax credit. The company now expects:

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E. A copy of the press release issued by Intuit today can be found on the investor relations page of Intuit's Web site.
Cautions About Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; expectations regarding growth from connected services and from current or future products and services; expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends and share repurchases; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2013; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-looking Guidance.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to
Intuit Second Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings
Page 7
develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at http://investors.intuit.com. Forward-looking statements are based on information as of February 21, 2013, and we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement or other information in these materials.

INTUIT INC.
NOTES TO TABLE A
 
 
 
We recorded an $8 million tax benefit on pretax income of $12 million for the
six months
ended
January 31, 2013
. Excluding discrete tax benefits primarily related to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit as described below, our effective tax rate for that period was approximately
33%
and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of
35%
. Our effective tax rate for the
six months
ended
January 31, 2012
was approximately
33%
and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of
35%
.
In January 2013 the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law. The Act includes a reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit through December 31, 2013 that was retroactive to January 1, 2012. We recorded a discrete tax benefit for the retroactive effect during the three and
six months
ended
January 31, 2013
.
We determined that Intuit Websites became discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We have therefore segregated the operating results of Intuit Websites from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was
$9
million for the
six
months ended
January 31, 2013
. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was
$19
million for the three months ended
January 31, 2012
and
$38
million for the
six
months ended
January 31, 2012
.
Net assets held for sale at July 31, 2012 consisted primarily of operating assets and liabilities that were not material, so we have not segregated them on our balance sheets. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated February 21, 2013 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Intuit Reports Season Results for TurboTax;
Revises Guidance
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - April 24, 2013
-
Intuit Inc.
(Nasdaq: INTU)
today issued its third and final season-to-date update for its consumer tax offerings. Intuit expects approximately 4 percent revenue growth in TurboTax for the 2013 fiscal year. As a result, the company updated third-quarter and full-year guidance.
Through April 16, sales of TurboTax Online units increased 6 percent versus the comparable prior-year period. Total TurboTax federal units were up 3 percent. As of April 12, Internal Revenue Service returns received were down 2 percent compared to last year.
"This was a tough tax season overall, and while we're disappointed in the outcome for TurboTax, we maintained our strong leadership position in the fastest-growing segment of tax preparation and saw impressive results in mobile, said Brad Smith, Intuit's president and chief executive officer. We're putting our performance within the context of overall industry results, and already have exciting efforts underway to strengthen our offering next season.

We expect our Accounting Professionals tax segment to deliver revenue growth within the guidance range of 5 to 8 percent for the year. Looking beyond tax, our Small Business results remain strong and are in line with our expectations of 15 to 17 percent revenue growth for the year as well," Smith said.
All business units, except Consumer Tax, are expected to be within their respective guidance ranges. As a result, Intuit now expects total company results to be below its previous guidance range for fiscal year 2013.

Although Intuit takes steps to verify the reliability of the unit data, Intuit believes that errors in the data reported by its retailers and distributors may impact its reported retail unit numbers on an immaterial basis.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated April 24, 2013 contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table 1 reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired

intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table 1 include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.

Intuit Realigns Organization to Accelerate Growth
New Structure to Advance Global Connected Services Strategy
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - May 20, 2013
-
Intuit Inc.
(Nasdaq: INTU) today announced an organizational realignment designed to propel the company into its next phase of long-term growth.
The new structure comes as the company increases its focus on two strategic outcomes: being the world's small business operating system, and providing winning solutions to do the nations' taxes in the U.S. and Canada.
Our mission and strategy remain unchanged, said Brad Smith, Intuit president and CEO, adding that the structure aligns with the company's refreshed connected services strategy unveiled in September. This realignment provides added focus on our core businesses, enabling us to move faster to better capitalize on the long-term growth opportunities that we see in North America and around the world.
Intuit's new structure becomes effective Aug. 1 in conjunction with the company's new fiscal year. It includes six go-to-market business units reporting to the chief executive officer. The business units and leaders are:

The company also announced that Kiran Patel, executive vice president and general manager of Intuit's Small Business Group, and Alex Lintner, senior vice president and general manager of Intuit's Global Business Division, will retire from Intuit shortly after the end of the fiscal year. The work of their respective organizations will be assimilated into the new organizational structure.
With these changes, we celebrate the success of our departing leaders and the depth of our leadership bench, added Smith. I am excited about the future opportunities we have as a company as we enter the next chapter of our connected services journey. Our focus is clear, and we have the structure we need to accelerate our decision making and go-to-market capabilities around the world.

Cautions About Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements about our refreshed company strategy, strategic outcomes and organizational realignment and their impact on Intuit's business. Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: inherent difficulty in predicting consumer behavior; difficulties in receiving, processing, or filing customer tax submissions; consumers may not respond as we expected to our advertising and promotional activities; product introductions and price competition from our competitors can have unpredictable negative effects on our revenue, profitability and market position; governmental encroachment in our tax businesses or other governmental activities or public policy affecting the preparation and filing of tax returns could negatively affect our operating results and market position; we may not be able to successfully innovate and introduce new offerings and business models to meet our growth and profitability objectives, and current and future offerings may not adequately address customer needs and may not achieve broad market acceptance, which could harm our operating results and financial condition; business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results; as we upgrade and consolidate our customer facing applications and supporting information technology infrastructure, any problems with these implementations could interfere with our ability to deliver our offerings; any failure to properly use and protect personal customer information and data could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; if we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third party business relationships, our business may be

adversely affected; increased government regulation of our businesses may harm our operating results; if we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against potential fraudulent activities, our revenue and earnings may be harmed; any significant offering quality problems or delays in our offerings could harm our revenue, earnings and reputation; our participation in the Free File Alliance may result in lost revenue opportunities and cannibalization of our traditional paid franchise; the continuing global economic downturn may continue to impact consumer and small business spending, financial institutions and tax filings, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability; year-over-year changes in the total number of tax filings that are submitted to government agencies due to economic conditions or otherwise may result in lost revenue opportunities; our revenue and earnings are highly seasonal and the timing of our revenue between quarters is difficult to predict, which may cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our financial results; our financial position may not make repurchasing shares advisable or we may issue additional shares in an acquisition causing our number of outstanding shares to grow; our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights may weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue and earnings; our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions; our use of significant amounts of debt to finance acquisitions or other activities could harm our financial condition and results of operation; and litigation involving intellectual property, antitrust, shareholder and other matters may increase our costs. More details about these and other risks that may impact our business are included in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2012 and in our other SEC filings. You can locate these reports through our website at

While it was a challenging tax season overall, we made progress in several key areas, growing new customers including first-time filers and former tax store customers, and significantly

It was another strong quarter across our small business division. The team continues to do great work growing customers in what remains a weak environment for small businesses. Each business in this segment delivered double-digit growth this quarter.
Across the company we are sharpening our focus on our core businesses, enabling us to move faster to better capitalize on the long-term growth opportunities that we see in North America and around the world.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables include non-GAAP financial measures. For a description of these non-GAAP financial measures, including the reasons management uses each measure, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled "About Non-GAAP Financial Measures" as well as the related Table B and Table E.

Cautions About Forward-looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including forecasts of Intuit's future expected financial results; expectations regarding growth from connected services and from current or future products and services;
expectations regarding changes to our products for next year;
expectations regarding the amount and timing of any future dividends and share repurchases; its prospects for the business in fiscal 2013; and all of the statements under the heading Forward-looking Guidance.

INTUIT INC.
GAAP CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS
(In millions, except per share amounts)
(Unaudited)
 
See accompanying Notes.
INTUIT INC.
NOTES TO TABLE A
 
[A] In March 2013 the largest customer for our Intuit Health online patient-to-provider communication solutions acquired a company that offers similar solutions and competes with us directly in that market space. As a result of this event, we tested the goodwill and acquired intangible assets of our Intuit Health reporting unit for impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and determined that they were impaired. Consequently, we recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $46 million that reduced the carrying value of those Intuit Health assets to zero.
 
 
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended
April 30, 2013
was approximately
34%
and for the
nine months
ended
April 30, 2013
was approximately 33% and these rates did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of
35%
. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended
April 30, 2012
was approximately
34%
and did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of
35%
.
We have segregated the operating results of Intuit Websites from continuing operations in our statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was
$9
million for the
nine
months ended
April 30, 2013
. Net revenue from Intuit Websites was
$19
million for the three months ended
April 30, 2012
and
$57
million for the
nine
months ended
April 30, 2012
.
Net assets held for sale at July 31, 2012 consisted primarily of operating assets and liabilities that were not material, so we have not segregated them on our balance sheets. Because operating cash flows from the Intuit Websites business were also not material for any period presented, we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows.

INTUIT INC.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The accompanying press release dated
May 21, 2013
contains non-GAAP financial measures. Table B and Table E reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures in that press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies.
We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
We exclude the following items from all of our non-GAAP financial measures:
We also exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share:
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for share-based compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe that our non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods.
The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures.
Share-based compensation expenses
. These consist of non-cash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards.
Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets
. When we acquire an entity, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the entity and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired entities. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete and trade names.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures non-cash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values.
Professional fees for business combinations
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal and accounting fees.
Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures gains and losses that we record when we sell or impair available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
Income tax effects of excluded items and certain discrete tax items
. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures the income tax effects of the items described above, as well as income tax effects related to business combinations. In addition, the effects of one-time income tax adjustments recorded in a specific quarter for GAAP purposes are reflected on a forecasted basis in our non-GAAP financial measures. This is consistent with how we plan, forecast and evaluate our operating results.
Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations
. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, and sales of available-for-sale debt securities and other investments.
