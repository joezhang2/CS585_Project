Contact: Paul Coghlan 6:30 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 15, 2003 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS IMPROVED SALES AND PROFITS BOTH OVER THE PRIOR YEAR AND PRIOR QUARTER Milpitas, California, April 15, 2003, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its third quarter ended March 30, 2003, were $153,750,000, an increase of 18% over net sales of $130,155,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $60,622,000 or $0.19 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 18% from $51,480,000 or $0.16 diluted earnings per share reported for the third quarter of last year. The Company is increasing its quarterly dividend from $0.05 to $0.06 per share. The payment will be on May 14, 2003 to stockholders of record on April 25, 2003. For the quarter the Company generated approximately $16 million in additional cash and short-term investments, net of spending approximately $39 million to purchase 1,500,000 shares of its common stock. During the quarter, the Company entered into a patent portfolio cross licensing and royalty agreement with Texas Instruments, Inc. for a 10 year period, which terminates existing litigation. The amortization expense for the royalty to be incurred is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "This was a good quarter for us as we grew sales 6% and profits 8% over the previous quarter. We continue to be strongly profitable as demonstrated by our 39% return on sales. We focus our efforts on unique high-performance analog intensive, market opportunities often in the newest generation end user products. This enables us to achieve good financial results during these difficult economic and geo-political times. However, accurately forecasting short-term results remains a
challenge. Nevertheless, we had good momentum in the March quarter and consequently estimate that sales and profits for the June quarter will grow sequentially in the mid to high single digits, 5% to 8%." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this news release are forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp-up of new facilities, and the timely introduction of new processes and products. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 16, 2003 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (913) 981-5508 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

Contact: Paul Coghlan 6:30 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, July 22, 2003 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY INCREASE IN SALES AND PROFITS. Milpitas, California, July 22, 2003, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its fiscal year ended June 29, 2003, were $606,573,000, an increase of 18% from net sales of $512,282,000 for the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the year of $236,591,000 or $0.74 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 20% from $197,629,000 or $0.60 diluted earnings per share reported for fiscal 2002. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended June 29, 2003 were $165,767,000, an 18% increase from net sales of $140,757,000 for the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $66,004,000 or $0.21 diluted earnings per share, compared with $55,034,000 or $0.17 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 20% from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Return on Sales was 40% for the quarter and 39% for the year. A cash dividend of $0.06 per share will be paid on August 20, 2003 to stockholders of record on August 1, 2003. The Company generated additional cash and short-term investments of $272 million for the year and $92 million for the fourth quarter before the purchase of common stock. The Company purchased 8,390,348 shares of its common stock for $230 million for the year including 1,945,000 shares for $64 million in the quarter, resulting in a net increase in cash and short-term investments of $42 million for the year and $28 million for the quarter. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "Fiscal 2003 was a successful, but challenging year for Linear, as we reported solid growth in a modestly improving economic environment. We benefited from the demand for our high-performance analog solutions in many new diverse applications in wireless, high-end consumer, automotive,
security, computer, military, industrial/medical and networking. Our sales increased 18%, and operating income improved 31%. We had an increase in net income of 20%, which was impacted by a decrease in interest income due to the dramatic decrease in interest rates. Although the overall demand for our products is improving, our customers continue to be cautious in their ordering patterns. While accurately forecasting short-term results remains a challenge, we expect low single digit growth in sales and profits in the September quarter, which is in line with our normal summer quarter patterns. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainities, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, July 23, 2003 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.

Demand for our products was particularly strong and increased in each end-market, led by industrial and communications. This broad cross section of strength, which crosses all end-markets and all major geographies, and is widely disbursed over many customers, is very encouraging. We continue to be both strongly profitable, as demonstrated by our 40% return on sales, and strongly cash flow positive from operations, as evidenced by the increase in cash. Looking forward we envision continued strength in our marketplace. Should these current trends continue, we expect to grow both sales and profits in the high single digit range sequentially in the March quarter."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this news release are forward-looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors, among others, as new orders received and shipped during the quarter, timely ramp-up of new facilities, and the timely introduction of new processes and products.

Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, July 20, 2004 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS A STRONG YEAR WITH ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY INCREASES IN SALES AND PROFITS. Milpitas, California, July 20, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its fiscal year ended June 27, 2004, were $807,281,000, an increase of 33% over net sales of $606,573,000 for the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the year of $328,171,000 or $1.02 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 39% from $236,591,000 or $0.74 diluted earnings per share reported for fiscal 2003. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended June 27, 2004 were $238,050,000, a 44% increase from net sales of $165,767,000 for the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $98,816,000 or $0.31 diluted earnings per share, compared with $66,004,000 or $0.21 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 50% from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Return on Sales was 42% for the quarter and 41% for the year. A cash dividend of $0.08 per share will be paid on August 18, 2004 to stockholders of record on July 30, 2004. The Company generated additional cash and short-term investments of $395 million for the year and $135 million for the fourth quarter before the purchase of common stock. The Company purchased 8,411,200 shares of its common stock for $332 million for the year including 3,406,200 shares for $127 million in the quarter, resulting in a net increase in cash and short-term investments of $63 million for the year and $8 million for the quarter. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "Fiscal 2004 was a very strong year for Linear with momentum building steadily as each of the quarters had accelerated year over year growth in sales and profits.
Accordingly, we closed the year with our strongest quarter growing sales 14% and profits 16% sequentially over the March quarter. Typically the summer quarter, which we are entering, is the quarter with the lowest sequential growth, generally low single digits. However, this year, given the broad based strength we are experiencing in our marketplace, should these current trends continue, we expect to have a seasonally strong start to our new fiscal year with sales growing roughly 5% to 7% sequentially from the quarter just completed." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.

Exhibit 99.1 For Release 9:00 am Eastern time Wednesday, October 6, 2004 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY'S BOB SWANSON MOVING TO EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN ROLE IN JANUARY; LOTHAR MAIER WILL BE PROMOTED TO CEO Milpitas, California, October 6, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that Bob Swanson will give up the title of CEO after 23 years, shifting to a new role as Executive Chairman. Lothar Maier, currently the company's Chief Operating Officer, will be named CEO effective January 4, 2005. According to Bob Swanson, "This transition has been planned for some time and is part of a two-phase plan that began over a year ago with the promotion of Dave Bell to President in June 2003. This second phase, naming Lothar Maier as CEO, is timed with the promotion of Alex McCann, who will replace Lothar as COO." Swanson has led Linear Technology as CEO since its founding in 1981 and was one of the early voices predicting that the high performance analog chip segment represented an exciting future growth opportunity, even in an age of digital electronics. Bob Swanson commented, "I think 23 years as Linear's CEO is two to three times longer than the average CEO's tenure at most high tech companies, and it's time to pass on the day-to-day management of the company to new energy. Lothar Maier's strong management and operational experience, combined with over 20 years in the semiconductor business and five years as Linear's COO, make him ideal to carry Linear's program forward. I believe that this management transition will be accomplished as efficiently and smoothly as most other tasks have been at Linear Technology." Swanson will remain at Linear as Executive Chairman and continue to spend considerable time focusing on strategy development, adherence to corporate financial objectives, board level issues and the management transition. Reporting to Lothar Maier in his role as CEO will be the President, Chief Technical Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Vice President of Quality and Reliability.
Lothar Maier joined Linear Technology as Chief Operating Officer in April 1999 from Cypress Semiconductor, where he held numerous management positions, most recently as Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President of Worldwide Operations. He holds a BS degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. Prior to his role as President, Dave Bell served in various management positions in his ten years with Linear, including Vice President and General Manager of Power Products. Before that he held management positions with IDEO Product Development, Sydis Inc., and Hewlett Packard. He has a BS degree in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Alex McCann joined Linear Technology in January 2004 from NanoOpto Corp., where he was Vice President of Operations. He was previously Vice President of Worldwide Operations at Anadigics Inc. and held various management positions at National Semiconductor UK Ltd. McCann has a BS degree in Electrical Engineering from James Watt College and an MBA from the University of Glasgow. Linear Technology Corporation was founded in 1981 as a manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits. Linear Technology products include high performance amplifiers, comparators, voltage references, monolithic filters, linear regulators, DC-DC converters, battery chargers, data converters, communications interface circuits, RF signal conditioning circuits, and many other analog functions.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, October 12, 2004 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND PROFITS OVER BOTH THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE PRIOR QUARTER Milpitas, California, October 12, 2004, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its first quarter ended September 26, 2004, were $253,028,000, an increase of 45% over net sales of $174,077,000 for the first quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $103,476,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 49% from $69,471,000 or $0.22 diluted earnings per share reported for the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $48.1 million, net of spending $54.6 million to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.08 per share will be paid on November 10, 2004 to stockholders of record on October 22, 2004. According to Robert H. Swanson, Chairman of the Board and CEO, "Sales grew 6% sequentially from the June quarter and we continued to be cash flow positive and strongly profitable as evidenced by our 41% return on sales. However, during the quarter bookings softened moderately. End-demand appeared to ease as shipments from both our international and domestic distributors to their end customers decreased slightly. These changes were moderate. Therefore it is difficult to conclude whether these trends reflect mostly tightening of inventory in these various channels combined with minor seasonal end-demand reductions, or whether end-demand will soften more substantially in the coming quarter. Specific to Linear Technology, we presently view this tightening as temporary. Our ending on-hand inventory at distributors is lean; cancellations are still minimal; and, lead times have remained unchanged at 4 to 6 weeks.
These are challenging times to forecast. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect continued cautiousness in the marketplace relative to inventory levels. However we expect end-demand to be relatively stable, with bookings increasing slightly over the quarter. Consequently we expect sales to be largely unchanged from the prior quarter with sequential revenues ranging from slightly down to flat." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, October 13, 2004 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (913) 981-4902 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, January 18, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFITS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR'S QUARTER AND INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.08 TO $0.10 PER SHARE. Milpitas, California, January 18, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its second quarter ended January 2, 2005, were $250,121,000, an increase of 34% over net sales of $186,021,000 for the second quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $102,818,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 38% from $74,335,000 or $0.23 diluted earnings per share reported for the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $27.3 million, net of spending $54.7 million to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock. The Company increased its quarterly dividend from $0.08 to $0.10 per share. The payment will be made on February 16, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 28, 2005. According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "As expected, sales and net income were slightly down from the September quarter. However the Company continued to be cash flow positive and strongly profitable as evidenced by the 41% return on sales. Bookings improved slightly during the quarter, particularly late in the quarter. Our ending on-hand inventory at distributors is lean; cancellations are still minimal; and, lead times have remained unchanged at 4 to 6 weeks. These continue to be challenging times to forecast. Softness in bookings for semiconductor companies has resulted from both inventory corrections throughout the various sales channels and also some moderations in the rate of growth of end demand. Looking forward to the March quarter we do not
expect further inventory reductions in the sales chain, rather bookings in the March quarter will be more reflective of true end-user consumption patterns. We expect end demand to be relatively stable, with bookings increasing moderately over the prior quarter. Consequently, we expect sequential revenues to be similar to the quarter just ended."

Exhibit 99.1 Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EST Vice President, Finance Tuesday, January 18, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES ACCELERATED VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS WITH EXERCISE PRICES IN EXCESS OF CURRENTMARKET PRICE Milpitas, California, January 18, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced it has accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options awarded more than one year ago to employees and officers under its stock option plans that had exercise prices greater than the current price of the stock ($37.04). The unvested options to purchase approximately 4.5 million additional shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration. Typically stock options granted at Linear Technology vest equally over a five year period. The purpose of the accelerated vesting is to enable Linear Technology Corporation to avoid recognizing in its income statement compensation expense associated with these options in future periods, upon adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R (Share-Based Payment) in July 2005. The charge to the income statement to be avoided amounts to approximately $75M over the course of the original vesting period, of which $36M occurs in the first fiscal year. "As an additional benefit, because these options have exercise prices in excess of current market values of our stock, we believe they are not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention, and thus the acceleration may have a positive effect on employee morale, retention and perception of option value," said Lothar Maier, CEO. Linear Technology Corporation was founded in 1981 as a manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits. Linear Technology products include high performance amplifiers, comparators, voltage references, monolithic filters, linear regulators, DC-DC converters, battery chargers, data converters, communications interface circuits, RF signal conditioning circuits, and many other analog functions. Applications for Linear Technology's high performance circuits include telecommunications, cellular telephones, networking products such as optical switches, notebook and desktop computers, computer peripherals, video/multimedia, industrial instrumentation, security monitoring devices, high-end consumer products such as digital cameras and MP3 players, complex medical devices, automotive electronics, factory automation, process control, and military and space systems.

Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 19, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED QUARTERLY REVENUES AND PROFITS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR'S QUARTER. CURRENT REVENUES INCLUDE ROYALTY REVENUE OF $40 MILLION. Milpitas, California, April 19, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that total revenue for its third quarter ended April 3, 2005, was $290,734,000, an increase of 39% over revenue of $209,133,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. Included in the current quarter's revenue is royalty revenue of $40,000,000, which represents past royalties receivable under terms of a settlement and license agreement with another company. Linear Technology expects to earn further royalties, dependent on sales of licensed products, quarterly from July 2005 through June 2013. Such ongoing quarterly royalty revenue is not expected to be material to each individual quarter's total revenue. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $121,633,000 or $0.39 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 42% from $85,549,000 or $0.27 diluted earnings per share reported for the third quarter of last year. The current quarter net income has been reduced by various expenses related to royalty revenue. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $5.2 million, net of spending $57.8 million to purchase 1,532,770 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid on May 18, 2005 to stockholders of record on April 29, 2005 According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Linear Technology completed a solid quarter, further enhanced by the settlement and license agreement. Product sales were similar to last quarter, whereas bookings improved slightly during the quarter. The Company continues to be cash flow positive and profitable as evidenced by the 42% return on sales.
The license agreement confirms the strength of our intellectual property. We continue to lead the market with high performance analog technology and innovative products. With regard to the upcoming quarter, these continue to be challenging times to forecast. Many customers are cautious given the general concerns in the macroeconomic environment. We expect end demand to be relatively stable with bookings increasing slightly over the prior quarter. Additional royalty revenue under the license agreement does not commence until the September quarter. However, we expect sequential product revenues in the June quarter to increase 2% to 3% over the quarter just ended. Consequently, we expect total revenue in the range of $255 million to $258 million." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 20, 2005 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 457-2679 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, July 26, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS A STRONG YEAR WITH ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES AND PROFITS. Milpitas, California, July 26, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net revenue for its fiscal year ended July 3, 2005, was $1,049,694,000, an increase of 30% over net revenue of $807,281,000 for the previous year. This revenue included $40,000,000 in royalty revenue received and previously reported in the third quarter. The Company also reported net income for the year of $433,974,000 or $1.38 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 32% from $328,171,000 or $1.02 diluted earnings per share reported for fiscal 2004. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended July 3, 2005 were $255,811,000, a 7% increase from net sales of $238,050,000 for the fourth quarter of the previous year. Net income for the quarter was $106,047,000 or $0.34 diluted earnings per share, compared with $98,816,000 or $0.31 diluted earnings per share, also an increase of 7% from the fourth quarter of the previous year. Return on Sales was 41% for both the quarter and the year. A cash dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid on August 24, 2005 to stockholders of record on August 5, 2005. The Company generated additional cash and short-term investments of $134.4 million for the year, net of spending $257.2 million to purchase 7,032,770 shares of its common stock. During the quarter, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $53.8 million, net of spending $90.2 million to purchase 2,500,000 shares of its common stock. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase an additional 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years. According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Fiscal 2005 was a good year for us in what was generally described as a slow growth environment, and our rate of sales growth was greater than all of our major competitors allowing us to achieve over $1 billion in revenues for the first time in the Company's history. For the June quarter our product sales grew 2% sequentially from the prior quarter, however, the March quarter also had $40,000,000 of royalty revenue, whereas there was no royalty revenue in the June quarter. The September quarter that we are entering is difficult to confidently forecast. It is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication business, yet typically shows growing strength in consumer oriented businesses, as the build period for year end holiday sales approaches. Further, while we expect our bookings to increase over the prior quarter, we enter the quarter requiring a modestly higher percentage of "turns" business, which is orders that must be both booked and shipped in the period. Consequently, we currently expect sales to be similar to the quarter just completed. Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004.

The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure. 2.5 MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 2.6 QUORUM The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 2.7 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 2.8 VOTING The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

2.9 WAIVER OF NOTICE Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 2.10 STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Any action that may be taken by the stockholders of the corporation at a duly called annual or special meeting may be taken by written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote. 2.11 RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING; GIVING CONSENTS In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If the board of directors does not so fix a record date: (i) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. (ii) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. -4-
2.12 PROXIES Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic or facsimile transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 2.13 LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.

ARTICLE III ----------- DIRECTORS --------- 3.1 POWERS Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors. 3.2 NUMBER OF DIRECTORS The number of directors shall be six (6), until changed by a bylaw amending this Section 3.2, duly adopted by the board of directors or by the stockholders. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires. -5-
3.3 ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, at each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the corporation shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders' meeting called and held in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless a stockholder demands election by written ballot at the meeting and before voting begins. 3.4 RESIGNATION AND VACANCIES Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws: (i) Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. (ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected. If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time -6-
outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable. 3.5 PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware. Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 3.6 FIRST MEETINGS The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place, if any, as may be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting, and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors. 3.7 REGULAR MEETINGS Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board. 3.8 SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary or any two (2) directors. Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally, by facsimile transmission or by telephone or by telegram, it shall be delivered personally, by facsimile transmission or by telephone or to the telegraph company at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally, by facsimile -7-
transmission or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. 3.9 QUORUM At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. 3.10 WAIVER OF NOTICE Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 3.11 ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. 3.12 BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee. 3.13 FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. -8-
3.14 APPROVAL OF LOANS TO OFFICERS The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute. 3.15 REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office. ARTICLE IV ---------- COMMITTEES ---------- 4.1 COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

ARTICLE VII ----------- RECORDS AND REPORTS ------------------- 7.1 MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records. Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.

The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. 7.3 ANNUAL STATEMENT TO STOCKHOLDERS The board of directors shall present at each annual meeting, and at any special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the stockholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation. 7.4 REPRESENTATION OF SHARES OF OTHER CORPORATIONS The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the treasurer, the secretary or assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation.

Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount. 8.3 STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon. 8.4 SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. -16-
8.5 LOST CERTIFICATES Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. 8.6 CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the Delaware General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person. 8.7 DIVIDENDS The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock pursuant to the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock. The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies. 8.8 FISCAL YEAR The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors. 8.9 SEAL This corporation may have a corporate seal, which may be adopted or altered at the pleasure of the board of directors, and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced. 8.10 TRANSFER OF STOCK Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books. -17-
8.11 STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENTS The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 8.12 REGISTERED STOCKHOLDERS The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware. ARTICLE IX ---------- AMENDMENTS ---------- The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. ARTICLE X --------- DISSOLUTION ----------- If it should be deemed advisable in the judgment of the board of directors of the corporation that the corporation should be dissolved, the board, after the adoption of a resolution to that effect by a majority of the whole board at any meeting called for that purpose, shall cause notice to be mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote thereon of the adoption of the resolution and of a meeting of stockholders to take action upon the resolution. At the meeting a vote shall be taken for and against the proposed dissolution. If a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon votes for the proposed dissolution, then a certificate stating that the dissolution has been authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section 275 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers shall be executed, acknowledged, and filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such certificate's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved. -18-
Whenever all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution consent in writing, either in person or by duly authorized attorney, to a dissolution, no meeting of directors or stockholders shall be necessary. The consent shall be filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such consent's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved. If the consent is signed by an attorney, then the original power of attorney or a photocopy thereof shall be attached to and filed with the consent. The consent filed with the Secretary of State shall have attached to it the affidavit of the secretary or some other officer of the corporation stating that the consent has been signed by or on behalf of all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution; in addition, there shall be attached to the consent a certification by the secretary or some other officer of the corporation setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers of the corporation. ARTICLE XI ---------- CUSTODIAN --------- 11.1 APPOINTMENT OF A CUSTODIAN IN CERTAIN CASES The Court of Chancery, upon application of any stockholder, may appoint one or more persons to be custodians and, if the corporation is insolvent, to be receivers, of and for the corporation when: (i) at any meeting held for the election of directors the stockholders are so divided that they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon qualification of their successors; or (ii) the business of the corporation is suffering or is threatened with irreparable injury because the directors are so divided respecting the management of the affairs of the corporation that the required vote for action by the board of directors cannot be obtained and the stockholders are unable to terminate this division; or (iii) the corporation has abandoned its business and has failed within a reasonable time to take steps to dissolve, liquidate or distribute its assets. 11.2 DUTIES OF CUSTODIAN The custodian shall have all the powers and title of a receiver appointed under Section 291 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, but the authority of the custodian shall be to continue the business of the corporation and not to liquidate its affairs and distribute its assets, except when the Court of Chancery otherwise orders and except in cases arising under Sections 226(a)(3) or 352(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. -19-

Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, October 18, 2005 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND PRO FORMA PROFITS OVER THE SIMILAR QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR Milpitas, California, October 18, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its first quarter ended October 2, 2005, were $256,013,000, an increase of 1% over net sales of $253,028,000 for the first quarter of the previous year. The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $99,181,000 or $0.31 diluted earnings per share, ($108,451,000 or $0.35 pro forma excluding stock based compensation as noted below) as compared to $103,476,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share reported for the first quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standard 123R (FAS123R), "Share-based Payments", which requires companies to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans, and record a commensurate expense in their income statement. Since the Company began its fiscal year this quarter, it is one of the first companies required to implement FAS123R. For Linear Technology, the total amount of stock based compensation during this quarter was $13,338,000. Under FAS123R calculations, there was also an increase in estimated diluted shares outstanding. Consequently, pro forma earnings per share, excluding stock based compensation accounting estimates, would have been $0.35 for the quarter ended October 2, 2005 versus $0.33 on a similar basis for the prior year's quarter. The Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $43.6 million, net of spending $64.5 million to purchase 1,656,165 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.10 per share will be paid on November 16, 2005 to stockholders of record on October 28, 2005. According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Sequentially sales were similar to the June quarter, however, demand increased resulting in a positive book to bill ratio. We continue to be strongly cash flow positive and our return on sales was 39% or 42% on a pro forma basis prior to the impact of stock based compensation accounting. Looking ahead to the December quarter, our bookings have improved, particularly in consumer related products, and consequently we expect sales to increase, roughly in the 3% to 4% range."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2005. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, October 19, 2005 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 234-0008 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

FAS123R - Stock Based Compensation became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005. FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Company's earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock based compensation. This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical financial performance and comparability between periods. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock based compensation particularly during this transitional period when most companies have not yet adopted the provisions of FAS123R.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement On October 18, 2005, Linear Technology Corporation (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Robert H. Swanson, Jr., the Executive Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). The amended and restated employment agreement was entered into in connection with the previously announced transition plan whereby Mr. Swanson voluntarily resigned from his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective January 4, 2005, but agreed, at the request of the Board, to remain as Executive Chairman of the Board, with duties requiring one to two days per week of Mr. Swanson's time. The amended and restated employment agreement clarifies how Mr. Swanson's target bonus and severance are calculated and has been updated to reflect Mr. Swanson's transition into his role solely as Executive Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to his amended and restated employment agreement Mr. Swanson continues to receive his existing salary of $405,000 per year and bonus pro rated based on the number of full days Mr. Swanson performs services as Executive Chairman throughout each fiscal year, but his bonus may not exceed 50% of the target bonus for the relevant period. In addition, Mr. Swanson's benefits continue (excluding participation in any Company employee stock purchase plan or 401(k) plan), and his stock options and restricted stock now vest at twice the rate, as if he had continued as Chief Executive Officer. If, in the future, Mr. Swanson is involuntarily terminated as Executive Chairman of the Board for any reason other than cause (as defined in his amended and restated employment agreement) or if he voluntarily resigns as an employee and as Executive Chairman, then 100% of his stock options, restricted stock and similar equity awards will immediately vest, and he will receive continued payment of one year's base salary and an annual target bonus payment (payable in equal installments over twelve months) calculated as two times the average of Mr. Swanson's target bonus for the four six-month bonus periods prior to the date of termination, in each case, as if Mr. Swanson had performed services on a full time basis and with no limitation on the amount of his actual compensation. In addition, the Company will pay Mr. Swanson's group health and dental plan continuation coverage premiums until the earlier of 18 months from his termination and such time as Mr. Swanson and his dependents are covered by similar plans of a new employer. If there is a change of control of the Company (as defined in his amended and restated employment agreement), Mr. Swanson will receive similar benefits to those he is entitled to receive if he is involuntarily terminated by the Company other than for cause or if he voluntarily resigns as an employee and Executive Chairman of the Board, including immediate vesting in full of his options, restricted stock and similar equity awards and payment of one year's base salary and annual target bonus (calculated as provided above) in a lump sum within five days of the change of control, whether or not he is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason. If Mr. Swanson should die while employed by the Company, 50% of his then unvested stock options, restricted stock and similar equity awards will vest immediately. The Company has a fractional ownership in two different aircraft operated by NetJets, Inc. So long as Mr. Swanson is Executive Chairman of the Board, he is entitled to use the Company's airplane for personal use for up to 35% of the available flight time in any year. To the extent use of the airplane results in imputed taxable income to Mr. Swanson, the Company will make additional payments to him, so that the net effect is the same as if no income were imputed to him. If payments to Mr. Swanson under his employment agreement (together with any other payments or benefits Mr. Swanson receives) would trigger the excise tax provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, Mr. Swanson will be paid an additional amount so that he receives, net of the excise taxes, the amount he would otherwise have been entitled to receive in their absence. The amended and restated employment agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. 2

Exhibit 10.50 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION ROBERT H. SWANSON, JR. AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT This Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of October 18, 2005 (the "Effective Date") by and between Linear Technology Corporation (the "Company") and Robert H. Swanson, Jr. ("Executive"). WHEREAS, Executive and the Company executed the Robert H. Swanson, Jr. Employment Agreement in January 2002 (the "Initial Employment Agreement"); WHEREAS, Executive has since resigned from his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, but at the request of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Initial Employment Agreement, has agreed to remain Executive Chairman of the Board; and WHEREAS, Executive and the Company desire to update the Initial Employment Agreement to reflect Executive's current role with the Company and to clarify certain provisions of the Initial Employment Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises and intending to be legally bound, the parties agree as follows: 1. Duties and Scope of Employment. (a) Positions; Agreement Commencement Date; Duties. Following the Effective Date, Executive shall continue to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board, reporting to the Board. The period of Executive's employment hereunder is referred to herein as the "Employment Term." During the Employment Term, Executive shall render such business and professional services in the performance of his duties, consistent with Executive's position within the Company, as shall reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. (b) Obligations. During the Employment Term, Executive shall devote his business efforts and time to the Company one to two days per week. Executive agrees, during the Employment Term, not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation or consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the approval of the Board that would result in a conflict of interest with the Company's business. 2. At-Will Employment. Executive and the Company understand and acknowledge that Executive's employment with the Company constitutes "at-will" employment. Subject to the Company's obligation to provide severance benefits as specified
herein, Executive and the Company acknowledge that this employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written notice to the other party, with or without good cause or for any or no cause, at the option either of the Company or Executive. 3. Compensation. (a) Base Salary. While employed by the Company, the Company shall pay the Executive as compensation for his services $405,000 (the "Base Salary"), divided by 365, and multiplied by each full day of service he performs as Executive Chairman of the Board. Such salary shall be paid periodically in accordance with normal Company payroll practices and subject to the usual, required withholding. Executive's Base Salary shall be reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board for possible adjustments in light of Executive's performance and competitive data. (b) Bonuses. Executive shall be eligible to earn a bonus under the Company's 1996 Senior Executive Bonus Plan as specified by the Compensation Committee of the Board and will also be eligible to participate in the Key Employee Incentive Bonus Plan or any successor bonus plans to such plans (collectively, the "Bonus Plans"). Executive's target bonus (the "Target Bonus") for any six-month period will be his target bonus for the previous six-month period increased or decreased by the same percentage the total bonus pool for the Bonus Plans for the six-month period in question increased or decreased compared to the previous six-month period. By way of example only, if Executive's Target Bonus for the first six-month period of a particular year is $1,000,000 and the total bonus pool for the Bonus Plans for the second six-month period of such year increases by ten percent (10%) over the total bonus pool for the Bonus Plans for the first six-month period of such year, then Executive's Target Bonus for second six-month period would be $1,100,000. Executive's actual bonus for any particular period will equal the actual bonus to which he would have otherwise been entitled for such period divided by 365, and multiplied by each full day of service he performs for the Company as Executive Chairman of the Board during such period, or alternatively in such amount as the Board deems appropriate, but in no event more than 50% of the Target Bonus for any relevant period. (c) Benefits. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans maintained by the Company that are applicable to other senior management to the full extent provided for under those plans, including health and other welfare plan participation, use of the Company airplane and pilot(s) as set forth in Section 3(d) hereof, office space and secretary, but excluding participation in any Company employee stock purchase plan intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any Company 401(k) plan and any benefits and perquisites where continuing Executive's participation would be either (i) contrary to statute or regulation, or (ii) highly impractical. (d) Use of Company Airplane. During the Employment Term, Executive shall be permitted to use, for personal purposes, the Company airplane and pilot(s), for up to 35% of the available flight time in any year; provided, however, that such use shall be subject to the Company's reasonable policies and airplane usage requirements. Executive shall be fully grossed-up for any imputed taxable income recognized by virtue of such use so that the net effect to Executive is the same as if there was no imputed income. 2
(e) Stock Options and Restricted Stock. Executive's stock options and restricted stock that were unvested as of the date Executive transitioned from Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of the Board to only Executive Chairman of the Board (the "Transition Date") shall continue to vest, subject to his continuing as Executive Chairman of the Board, at twice the rate as if he had continued as Chief Executive Officer. For example, if Executive has a stock option that is 25% unvested on the Transition Date and the option is scheduled to vest as to 1/12 of the unvested shares each month so as to be 100% vested on the one year anniversary of the Transition Date, the vesting schedule shall be accelerated so that the option shall vest at to 1/12 of the unvested shares each half-month, so as to be 100% vested six months following the Transition Date. (f) Severance Prior to a Change of Control. (i) Voluntary Termination for Good Reason; Involuntary Termination Other Than for Cause. If, prior to a Change of Control (as defined herein), Executive's tenure as Executive Chairman of the Board, terminates due to (i) a voluntary termination for "Good Reason" (as defined herein) where the grounds for the Good Reason are not cured by the Company within thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice specifying the grounds from Executive, or (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company other than for "Cause" (as defined herein), then, subject to Executive executing and not revoking a standard form of mutual release of claims with the Company and not breaching the terms of Section 11 hereof, (i) all of Executive's Company stock options (together with other rights to purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock (including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall immediately accelerate vesting as to 100% of the then unvested amount of such award, (ii) Executive shall receive continued payments of severance pay for twelve (12) months following the date of such termination at a rate equal to (A) Executive's annual Base Salary rate as in effect on the date of such termination, plus (B) two (2) times the average of his Target Bonus for the four (4) six-month bonus periods prior to the date of such termination (which amount related to the average Target Bonus will payable in equal installments over such twelve-month period), in each case, as if Executive had performed services as Executive Chairman of the Board on a full-time basis with no limitation on the amount of his actual compensation (e.g., Executive's bonus would not be limited to 50% of his Target Bonus for any particular period)), less applicable withholding and payable in accordance with the Company's standard payroll practices (the "Severance Payment"), (iii) the Company shall pay the group health and dental plan continuation coverage premiums for Executive and his covered dependents under Title X of the Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") for the lesser of (A) eighteen (18) months from the date of Executive's termination of employment, or (B) the date upon which Executive and his covered dependents are covered by similar plans of Executive's new employer (the "COBRA Coverage"). For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) an act of personal dishonesty taken by Executive in connection with his responsibilities hereunder and intended to result in substantial personal enrichment of Executive, (ii) Executive being convicted of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony, (iii) a willful act by Executive which constitutes gross misconduct and which is 3
injurious to the Company, and (iv) following delivery to Executive of a written demand for performance from the Company which describes the basis for the Company's reasonable belief that Executive has not substantially performed his duties, continued violations by Executive of Executive's obligations to the Company which are demonstrably willful and deliberate on Executive's part. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means, without Executive's express consent, (i) a material reduction of Executive's duties, title, authority or responsibilities, relative to Executive's duties, title, authority or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to such reduction, or the assignment to Executive of such reduced duties, title, authority or responsibilities (ii) a material reduction, of the facilities and perquisites (including office space and location) available to Executive immediately prior to such reduction, other than a reduction generally applicable to all senior management of the Company; (iii) a reduction by the Company in the Base Salary of Executive as in effect immediately prior to such reduction; (iv) a material reduction by the Company in the aggregate level of employee benefits, including Target Bonuses, to which Executive was entitled immediately prior to such reduction with the result that Executive's aggregate benefits package is materially reduced (other than a reduction that generally applies to Company employees); (v) the relocation of Executive to a facility or a location more than thirty-five (35) miles from Executive's then present location; or (vi) any act or set of facts or circumstances which would, under California case law or statute constitute a constructive termination of Executive; provided, however, that Executive agrees that Executive's transition from Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board to Chairman pursuant to Section 3(f) of the Initial Employment Agreement and the related reductions in pay, responsibilities and the like did not constitute Good Reason. The Executive shall not be required to mitigate the value of any severance benefits contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such benefits be reduced by any earnings or benefits that the Executive may receive from any other source; provided, however, that if Executive receives severance benefits hereunder, he expressly waives the right to receive severance benefits under any other severance plan or policy of the Company. (ii) Voluntary Termination Other than for Good Reason; Involuntary Termination for Cause. Except as provided otherwise in Sections 3(f) hereof, in the event Executive terminates his employment voluntarily other than for Good Reason or is involuntarily terminated by the Company for Cause, then all vesting of Executive's stock options (together with other rights to purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock (including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall terminate immediately and all payments of compensation by the Company to Executive hereunder shall immediately terminate (except as to amounts already earned). (g) Change of Control Benefits. In the event of a "Change of Control" (as defined herein), Executive shall receive the benefits specified in Section 3(f)(i) above (including 100% vesting acceleration); provided that the Severance Payment shall be payable in a lump-sum within five days following the Change of Control and the COBRA Coverage shall be extended to Executive upon any subsequent termination of his employment, whether or not for Cause or Good Reason. In the event Executive's tenure as Executive Chairman of the Board terminates following a Change of Control, for any or no reason, including pursuant to Sections 3(h) hereof, Executive shall not be entitled to any additional compensation (excepts as to amounts already earned and payments and benefits due pursuant to Section 3(f)). 4
For purposes of this Agreement, "Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) Any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or (ii) The consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company's assets; or (iii) The consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or (iv) A change in the composition of the Board occurring within a two-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" shall mean directors who either (A) are directors of the Company as of the date upon which this Agreement was entered into, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of those directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with any transaction described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above, or in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors to the Company. (h) Voluntary Termination when Executive is 65 or Older. In the event that on or after his 65th birthday, Executive (i) voluntarily terminates as Executive Chairman of the Board, and, (ii) if he is then employed by the Company, voluntarily terminates such employment, then Executive shall receive the same benefits as if such voluntary termination was a voluntary termination for Good Reason, which will entitle him to severance benefits under Section 3(f)(i), and, if applicable, paid and provided as set forth in Section 3(g). 4. Death or Total Disability of Executive. (a) Death. Upon Executive's death while Executive is an employee or consultant of the Company, then (i) employment hereunder shall automatically terminate, (ii) all of Executive's Company stock options (together with other rights to purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock (including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall immediately accelerate vesting as to 50% of the then unvested amount of such award, and all subsequent vesting of Executive's stock options (together with other rights to purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock (including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall terminate immediately, and (iii) all payments of compensation by the Company to Executive hereunder shall immediately terminate (except as to amounts already earned). 5
(b) Disability. Upon Executive's becoming permanently and totally disabled (as defined in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 22(e)(3) or its successor provision) while Executive is an employee of the Company, then employment hereunder shall automatically terminate and all payments of compensation by the Company to Executive hereunder shall immediately terminate (except as to amounts already earned), and all vesting of Executive's stock options (together with other rights to purchase or receive Company common stock) and restricted stock (including restricted stock units and similar awards) shall terminate immediately. 5. Golden Parachute Excise Tax Full Gross-Up. In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Executive constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then Executive shall receive (i) a payment from the Company sufficient to pay such excise tax, plus (ii) an additional payment from the Company sufficient to pay the excise tax and federal and state income and employment taxes arising from the payments made by the Company to Employee pursuant to this sentence. Unless the Company and the Executive otherwise agree in writing, the determination of Executive's excise tax liability and the amount required to be paid under this Section 5 shall be made in writing by the Company's independent auditors who are primarily used by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control (the "Accountants"). For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5. 6. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of (a) the heirs, beneficiaries, executors and legal representatives of Executive upon Executive's death and (b) any successor of the Company. Any such successor of the Company shall be deemed substituted for the Company under the terms of this Agreement for all purposes. As used herein, "successor" shall include any person, firm, corporation or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company. None of the rights of Executive to receive any form of compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be assignable or transferable except through a testamentary disposition or by the laws of descent and distribution upon the death of Executive. Any attempted assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than as aforesaid) of any interest in the rights of Executive to receive any form of compensation hereunder shall be null and void. 6
7. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other communications called for hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if (i) delivered personally or by facsimile, (ii) one (1) day after being sent by Federal Express or a similar commercial overnight service, or (iii) three (3) days after being mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, prepaid and addressed to the parties or their successors in interest at the following addresses, or at such other addresses as the parties may designate by written notice in the manner aforesaid: If to the Company: Linear Technology Corporation 720 Sycamore Drive Milpitas, CA 95035 Attn: General Counsel If to Executive: Robert H. Swanson, Jr. at the last residential address known by the Company. 8. Severability. In the event that any provision hereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable or void, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect without said provision. 9. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously entered into by and between the Company and Executive and the indemnification agreement previously entered into by and between the Company and Executive represent the entire agreement and understanding between the Company and Executive concerning Executive's employment relationship with the Company, and supersede and replace any and all prior agreements and understandings concerning Executive's employment relationship with the Company. 10. Dispute Resolution. (a) The parties shall first meet to settle any dispute through good faith negotiation or non-binding mediation. If not settled by good faith negotiation or non-binding mediation between the parties within 30 days from the date one party requests in writing to meet the other party, then to the extent permitted by law, any dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement, or the interpretation, validity, construction, performance, breach, or termination thereof shall be finally settled by binding arbitration to be held in Santa Clara County, California, in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules"). The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator shall be confidential, final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered under a protective order on the arbitrator's decision in any court having jurisdiction. The Company shall pay all costs of any mediation or arbitration; provided, however, that each party shall pay its own attorney and advisor fees. (b) The arbitrator shall apply California law to the merits of any dispute or claim, without reference to rules of conflict of law. The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by federal arbitration law and by the Rules, without reference to state arbitration law. Executive hereby expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in California for any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement and/or relating to any arbitration in which the parties are participants. (c) Executive understands that nothing in Section 10 modifies Executive's at-will status. Either the Company or Executive can terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause. 7
(d) EXECUTIVE HAS READ AND UNDERSTANDS SECTION 10, WHICH DISCUSSES ARBITRATION. EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS THAT BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EXECUTIVE AGREES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TO SUBMIT ANY FUTURE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE INTERPRETATION, VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE, BREACH, OR TERMINATION THEREOF TO BINDING ARBITRATION, AND THAT THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF EXECUTIVE'S RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND RELATES TO THE RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP. 11. Covenants Not to Compete and Not to Solicit. (a) Covenant Not to Compete. In consideration for the benefits Executive is to receive herein Executive agrees that, until the end of the twelve month period following the date of his termination of employment with the Company for any reason or no reason, Executive will not directly engage in (whether as an employee, consultant, proprietor, partner, director or otherwise), or have any ownership interest in, or participate in the financing, operation, management or control of, any person, firm, corporation or business that engages or participates anywhere in the world in providing goods and services similar to those provided by the Company upon the date of Executive's termination of employment. Ownership of less than 3% of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation or other entity will not constitute a violation of this provision. The Company agrees not to unreasonably withhold consent from Executive to engage in any activity that is not competitive with the Company. (b) Covenant Not to Solicit. In consideration for the benefits Executive is to receive herein Executive agrees that he will not, at any time during the twelve month period following his termination date, directly or indirectly solicit any individuals to leave the Company's employ for any reason or interfere in any other manner with the employment relationships at the time existing between the Company and its current or prospective employees. (c) Representations. The parties intend that the covenants contained in Section 11(a) and (b) shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each county, city and state (or analogous entity) and country of the world. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants, or any part thereof, then such unenforceable covenant, or such part thereof, shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants, or portions thereof, to be enforced. (d) Reformation. In the event that the provisions of this Section 11 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations, or scope of this covenant, permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws. 8
(e) Reasonableness of Covenants. Employee represents that he (i) is familiar with the covenants not to compete and solicit, and (ii) is fully aware of his obligations hereunder, including, without limitation, the reasonableness of the length of time, scope and geographic coverage of these covenants. 12. No Oral Modification, Cancellation or Discharge. This Agreement may only be amended, canceled or discharged in writing signed by Executive and the Company's then existing Chief Executive Officer, subject to prior approval of the Board. 13. Withholding. The Company shall be entitled to withhold, or cause to be withheld, from payment any amount of withholding taxes required by law with respect to payments made to Executive in connection with his employment hereunder. 14. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (with the exception of its conflict of laws provisions). 15. Acknowledgment. Executive acknowledges that he has had the opportunity to discuss this matter with and obtain advice from his private attorney, has had sufficient time to, and has carefully read and fully understands all the provisions of this Agreement, and is knowingly and voluntarily entering into this Agreement. 9

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED QUARTERLY SALES AND PROFITS AND INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND 50% FROM $0.10 TO $0.15 PER SHARE
Milpitas, California, January 17, 2006, Linear   Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that net sales for its second quarter ended January 1, 2006, were $265,146,000, an increase of 6% over net sales of $250,121,000 for the second quarter of the previous year.  The Company also reported net income for the quarter of $103,264,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share, ($112,807,000 or $0.36 pro forma excluding stock based compensation as noted below) as compared to $102,818,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share reported for the second quarter of last year.  During this fiscal year, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (FAS123R), "Share-based Payments," which requires companies to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, includ ing stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans, and record a commensurate expense in their income statement.  For Linear Technology, the total amount of stock based compensation during this quarter was $13,731,000.  Under FAS123R calculations, there was also an increase in estimated diluted shares outstanding.  Consequently, pro forma diluted earnings per share, excluding stock based compensation accounting estimates, would have been $0.36 for the quarter ended January 1, 2006 versus $0.34 on a similar basis for the prior year's quarter.  Sequentially, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $7.1 million, net of spending $56 million to purchase 1,617,557 shares of common stock.
The Company also declared a 50% increase in its dividend from $0.10 to $0.15 per share.  This cash dividend will be paid on February 15, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 27, 2006.    
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Sales and profits for the December quarter increased
both year over year and sequentially from the September quarter.  Demand increased resulting in a positive book to bill ratio.  Our return on sales was a strong 39%, or 43% on a pro forma basis prior to the impact of stock based compensation accounting.
We continue to be cash flow positive and our confidence in our cash generating capabilities has enabled us to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 50%.
Looking ahead we expect sales growth of 5% to 6% in the March quarter over the December quarter fueled by bookings growth in industrial, communications infrastructure, networking and automotive end markets."
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2005.
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, January 18, 2006 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.

FAS123R - Stock Based Compensation became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005.  FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement.  To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Company's earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock based compensation.  This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical financial performance and comparability between periods.  We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock based compensation particula rly during this transitional period when many companies have not yet adopted the provisions of FAS123R.

Contact: Paul Coghlan 5:00 EDT Vice President, Finance Tuesday, April 18, 2006 (408) 432-1900 US1 LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER. Milpitas, California, April 18, 2006, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that total revenues for its third quarter ended April 2, 2006, of $278,888,000, increased 5% over second quarter total revenues of $265,146,000. The Company also reported that third quarter net income of $110,555,000, or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, increased 7% over second quarter net income of $103,264,000 or $0.33 diluted earnings per share. Sequentially, the Company's cash and short-term investments increased by $74.1 million, net of spending $20.2 million to purchase 532,769 shares of common stock. A cash dividend of $0.15 per share will be paid on May 17, 2006 to stockholders of record on April 28, 2006. On a year-over-year basis, fiscal 2006 third quarter total revenues of $278,888,000 decreased 4% from total revenues of $290,734,000 for the third quarter of the previous year. Included in last year's quarterly revenues was a royalty payment of $40,000,000, which represented past royalties under terms of a settlement and license agreement with another company. Subsequent quarterly royalty payments have been immaterial to each individual quarter's total revenues. Net income for the quarter of $110,555,000 or $0.35 diluted earnings per share, ($119,742,000 or $0.38 per share pro forma excluding stock-based compensation as noted below) decreased 9% as compared to $121,633,000 or $0.39 diluted earnings per share ($126,562,000 or $0.40 per share pro forma) reported for the third quarter of last year. Net income for the third quarter of last year was also positively affected by the $40,000,000 royalty payment. During this fiscal year, the Company implemented Financial Accounting Standard No. 123R (FAS123R), "Share-based Payment," which requires companies to estimate the cost of all forms of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchase plans, and record a commensurate expense in their income statement. For Linear Technology, the total amount of stock-based compensation during this quarter was $13,218,000. Under FAS123R calculations, there was also an increase in estimated diluted shares outstanding. Consequently, pro forma diluted earnings per share, excluding stock-based compensation accounting estimates, would have been $0.38 for the quarter ended April 2, 2006 versus $0.40 on a similar basis for the prior year's quarter.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "Sales and profits for the March quarter increased sequentially from the December quarter. Demand increased resulting in a positive book to bill ratio. Our return on sales was a strong 40%, or 43% on a pro forma basis prior to the impact of stock-based compensation accounting, and we continue to be cash flow positive. As we had anticipated, strong sales for domestic and European distributors signaled a solid improvement in our broad based industrial business. Looking ahead, we currently expect this to continue into the June quarter and we are expecting sales and profits to again increase roughly 5%." Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated growth of our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2005. Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 19, 2006 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 234-0008 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock-based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Company's earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock-based compensation. This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical financial performance and comparability between periods. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock-based compensation particularly during this transitional period when many companies are initially adopting the provisions of FAS123R.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
 
As previously disclosed in the Companys proxy statement for its 2006 Annual Meeting of Stockholder, Leo McCarthy, a member of the Companys Board of Directors since 1994, will not stand for reelection at the 2006 Annual Meeting due to health reasons.
Item 5.03 Amendment to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
 
On October 17, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to amend Article III, Section 3.2 of the Companys Bylaws, effective as of the election of directors at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders on November 1, 2006, to provide that in the future the size of the Board of Directors will be as determined by the Board by resolution from time to time. Previously, Section 3.2 of the Bylaws provided for a specified number of directors -- six in the present case. As a result, changes in the size of the Board necessitated an amendment of the Bylaws.
Concurrently with adopting resolutions to amend the Bylaws, the directors adopted resolutions setting the size of the Board at five members, effective as of the amendment of the Bylaws.
A copy of the bylaws, to be effective November 1, 2006, is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.1.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits

The registered office of the corporation shall be 15 East North Street, City of Dover, County of Kent, Delaware 19901. The name of the registered agent of the corporation at such location is Incorporating Services, Ltd.
 
 
The board of directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
 
 
 
 
 
Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the State of Delaware, designated by the board of directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
 
 
The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held the first Wednesday of November in each year at 3:00 P.M. However, if such day falls on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding full business day. At the meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.
 
 
A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, or by the chairman of the board, by the president or by the holders of 10% or more of the voting shares of the corporation. The date, time and location of, and record date for, any such special meeting shall be determined by the Board of Directors.
 
1
 
All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
 
To be properly brought before an annual meeting or special meeting, nominations for the election of director or other business must be (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (c) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For such nominations or other business to be considered properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder such stockholder must have given timely notice and in proper form of his intent to bring such business before such meeting. To be timely, such stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary of the corporation not less than ninety (90) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than one-hundred (100) days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth:
 
(i)
 
the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nominations or propose the business and, as the case may be, the name and address of the person or persons to be nominated or the nature of the business to be proposed;
(ii)
 
a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and, if applicable, intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice or introduce the business specified in the notice;
(iii)
 
if applicable, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder;
(iv)
 
such other information regarding each nominee or each matter of business to be proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, or the matter been proposed, or intended to be proposed by the board of directors; and
(v)
 
if applicable, the consent of each nominee to serve as director of the corporation if so elected.
The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the nomination of any person or the proposal of any business not made in compliance with the foregoing procedure.
 
2
 
Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
 
 
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.
 
 
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
 
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
 
Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
 
3
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
 
 
Any action that may be taken by the stockholders of the corporation at a duly called annual or special meeting may be taken by written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote.
 
 
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.
 
If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:
 
(i)
  
The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
 
(ii)
  
The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
 
A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
 
4
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic or facsimile transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(c) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
 
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
 
 
 
 
 
Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
 
 
The number of directors shall be as determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
 
 
Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, at each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the corporation shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders' meeting called and held in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.
 
Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless a stockholder demands election by written ballot at the meeting and before voting begins.
 
5
 
Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the corporation. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in this section in the filling of other vacancies.
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws:
 
(i)
  
Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
 
(ii)
  
Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
 
If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware as far as applicable.
 
6
 
The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware.
 
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
 
 
The first meeting of each newly elected board of directors shall be held at such time and place, if any, as may be fixed by the vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting, and no notice of such meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present. In the event of the failure of the stockholders to fix the time or place of such first meeting of the newly elected board of directors, or in the event such meeting is not held at the time and place so fixed by the stockholders, the meeting may be held at such time and place as shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter provided for meetings of the board of directors, or as shall be specified in a written waiver signed by all of the directors.
 
 
Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.
 
 
Special meetings of the board of directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the secretary or any two (2) directors.
 
Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally, by facsimile transmission or by telephone or by telegram, it shall be delivered personally, by facsimile transmission or by telephone or to the telegraph company at least forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally, by facsimile transmission or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
 
7
 
At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
 
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.
 
 
If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.
 
 
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.
 
 
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.
 
 
The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.
 
8
 
Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.
 
No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.
 
 
 
 
 
The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in the bylaws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) amend the certificate of incorporation (except that a committee may, to the extent authorized in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of shares of stock adopted by the board of directors as provided in Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, fix any of the preferences or rights of such shares relating to dividends, redemption, dissolution, any distribution of assets of the corporation or the conversion into, or the exchange of such shares for, shares of any other class or classes or any other series of the same or any other class or classes of stock of the corporation), (ii) adopt an agreement of merger or consolidation under Sections 251 or 252 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, (iii) recommend to the stockholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of the corporation's property and assets, (iv) recommend to the stockholders a dissolution of the corporation or a revocation of a dissolution, or (v) amend the bylaws of the corporation; and, unless the board resolution establishing the committee, the bylaws or the certificate of incorporation expressly so provide, no such committee shall have the power or authority to declare a dividend, to authorize the issuance of stock, or to adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
 
The corporation shall have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
 
13
 
The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
 
 
 
 
The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records.
 
Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
 
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
 
 
Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
 
14
 
The board of directors shall present at each annual meeting, and at any special meeting of the stockholders when called for by vote of the stockholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation.
 
 
The chairman of the board, the president, any vice president, the treasurer, the secretary or assistant secretary of this corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent, and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority granted herein may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
 
 
 
 
 
From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
 
 
The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
 
15
 
The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the treasurer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
 
The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
 
 
If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
 
 
Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
 
16
 
Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the Delaware General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person.
 
 
The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock pursuant to the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock.
 
The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies.
 
 
The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors.
 
 
This corporation may have a corporate seal, which may be adopted or altered at the pleasure of the board of directors, and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof, to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.
 
 
Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.
 
 
The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
 
17
 
The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.
 
 
 
 
The original or other bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
 
 
 
If it should be deemed advisable in the judgment of the board of directors of the corporation that the corporation should be dissolved, the board, after the adoption of a resolution to that effect by a majority of the whole board at any meeting called for that purpose, shall cause notice to be mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote thereon of the adoption of the resolution and of a meeting of stockholders to take action upon the resolution.
 
At the meeting a vote shall be taken for and against the proposed dissolution. If a majority of the outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote thereon votes for the proposed dissolution, then a certificate stating that the dissolution has been authorized in accordance with the provisions of Section 275 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers shall be executed, acknowledged, and filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such certificate's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved.
 
Whenever all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution consent in writing, either in person or by duly authorized attorney, to a dissolution, no meeting of directors or stockholders shall be necessary. The consent shall be filed and shall become effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. Upon such consent's becoming effective in accordance with Section 103 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the corporation shall be dissolved. If the consent is signed by an attorney, then the original power of attorney or a photocopy thereof shall be attached to and filed with the consent. The consent filed with the Secretary of State shall have attached to it the affidavit of the secretary or some other officer of the corporation stating that the consent has been signed by or on behalf of all the stockholders entitled to vote on a dissolution; in addition, there shall be attached to the consent a certification by the secretary or some other officer of the corporation setting forth the names and residences of the directors and officers of the corporation.
 
 
18
 
 
 
The Court of Chancery, upon application of any stockholder, may appoint one or more persons to be custodians and, if the corporation is insolvent, to be receivers, of and for the corporation when:
 
(i)
  
at any meeting held for the election of directors the stockholders are so divided that they have failed to elect successors to directors whose terms have expired or would have expired upon qualification of their successors; or
 
(ii)
  
the business of the corporation is suffering or is threatened with irreparable injury because the directors are so divided respecting the management of the affairs of the corporation that the required vote for action by the board of directors cannot be obtained and the stockholders are unable to terminate this division; or
 
(iii)
  
the corporation has abandoned its business and has failed within a reasonable time to take steps to dissolve, liquidate or distribute its assets.
 
 
The custodian shall have all the powers and title of a receiver appointed under Section 291 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, but the authority of the custodian shall be to continue the business of the corporation and not to liquidate its affairs and distribute its assets, except when the Court of Chancery otherwise orders and except in cases arising under Sections 226(a)(3) or 352(a)(2) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On January 16, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation issued a press release titled 
Linear Technology reports revenue and net income similar to the second quarter of the previous fiscal year, but down sequentially from the September quarter. The Company is increasing its quarterly cash dividend from $0.15 to $0.18 per share
.
 
 
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS REVENUE AND NET INCOME SIMILAR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR, BUT DOWN SEQUENTIALLY FROM THE SEPTEMBER QUARTER. THE COMPANY IS INCREASING ITS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.15 TO $0.18 PER SHARE
.
Milpitas, California, January 16, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that revenue for its quarterly period ended December 31, 2006, was $267.9 million, an increase of 1% over revenue of $265.1 million for the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. Net income computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the second quarter of fiscal year 2007 was $105.0 million, or $0.34 diluted earnings per share, and was similar to GAAP net income of $103.3 million or $0.33 diluted earnings per share reported in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. On a pro forma basis excluding the effects of all forms of stock-based compensation, net income was $117.8 million, or $0.39 diluted earnings per share, an increase of $5.0 million over pro forma net income of $112.8 million, or $0.36 per share reported in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. Sequentially, compared with the September quarter, sales were down 8%. GAAP income before tax was down 10%. The effective tax rate improved from 31% to 28%, primarily due to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, and consequently net income decreased by 7%. During the most recent quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance decreased $30.3 million net of spending $91.7 million to purchase 3.0 million shares of its common stock.
 
The Company also declared a 20% increase in its dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.18 per share for the quarter. This cash dividend will be paid on February 14, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 26, 2007.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "We are seeing an overall reduction in our inventories at our end customers, which coupled with some general market weakness, has resulted in a decrease in bookings, sales and profits for the December quarter. The upcoming March quarter is a challenge to accurately forecast. Visibility continues to be low and customers remain guarded in their forecasting and inventory management. The March quarter has historically been strong for Linear due to seasonal strength in industrial markets. However, with inventory reductions expected to continue and low market visibility, this year we expect will be an exception. It is likely that improvements in Europe and the USA may be offset by slowness in Asia, particularly in consumer related markets. Consequently, we currently expect revenue to be down 4% to 7% with profits slightly more impacted primarily due to an increase in the tax rate. However, any increase in confidence in the overall business environment would positively impact this outlook.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2006.
 
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, January 17, 2007 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.

FAS123R - Share-Based Payment became effective and was adopted by the Company during the quarter ended October 2, 2005. FAS123R requires the Company to estimate the cost of all forms of stock-based compensation, including employee stock options, and to record a commensurate expense in the income statement. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we have shown above a non-GAAP (pro forma) presentation of the Companys earnings per share, which is adjusted to reflect the GAAP results to exclude all stock-based compensation. This non-GAAP presentation of earnings per share is provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Companys historical financial performance and comparability between periods. We believe the non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors by excluding stock-based compensation.

On April 17, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation ("Linear") issued a press release announcing the proposed private placement of $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due May 1, 2027. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: April 17, 2007
 

Exhibit 99.1
MILPITAS, Calif.Linear Technology Corporation (NasdaqGS:LLTC) announced today that it intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027, which notes will be issued in a $1 billion tranche and a $700 million tranche, through an offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.
Each series of notes will be initially convertible, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, into a combination of cash up to the principal amount of the notes and cash, common stock or a combination thereof, at Linear's election, with respect to any excess conversion value over the principal amount. The interest rate, conversion rate and other terms for each series of notes are to be determined by negotiations between Linear and the initial purchaser of the notes.
Linear intends to use the entire net proceeds of the offering to fund a portion of its planned repurchase of approximately $3 billion of its common stock pursuant to an accelerated stock repurchase transaction it expects to enter into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser simultaneously with the offering of the notes.
The initial purchaser has advised Linear that, in connection with the counterparty to the accelerated stock repurchase establishing its initial hedge of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, it expects such counterparty or its affiliate to enter into various derivative and/or common stock purchase transactions in secondary market transactions concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This counterparty or its affiliate is likely to modify such hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Linear common stock and/or by purchasing or selling Linear common stock in secondary market transactions prior to final settlement of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction. In addition, during the term of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, which is expected to last approximately nine months, this counterparty or its affiliate will purchase shares of Linear common stock in connection with the accelerated stock repurchase transaction.
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
The securities will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws, and unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and applicable state laws.
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, whether or not Linear will offer the notes or consummate the offering, the anticipated terms of the notes and the offering and the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering.

Linear Technology Corporation hereby files an updated description of its risk factors for the purpose of updating the risk factor disclosure contained in its public filings.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
Risks Related to Our Business
Downturns in the business cycle could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
The semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may cause us to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our results of operations. The growth rate of the global economy is one of the factors affecting demand for semiconductor components. Many factors could adversely affect regional or global economic growth including increased price inflation for goods, services or materials, rising interest rates in the United States and the rest of the world, a significant act of terrorism which disrupts global trade or consumer confidence, geopolitical tensions including war and civil unrest, reduced levels of economic activity, or disruptions of international transportation.
Typically, our ability to meet our revenue goals and projections is dependent to a large extent on the orders we receive from our customers within the period and by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders on hand and orders received within a period for delivery in that period. Because of this complexity in our business, no assurance can be given that we will achieve a match of inventory on hand, production units, and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue and net income goals.
Volatility in customer demand in the semiconductor industry affect future levels of sales and profitability and limit our ability to predict such levels.
Historically, we have maintained low lead times, which has enabled customers to place orders close to their true needs for product. In defining our financial goals and projections, we consider inventory on hand, backlog, production cycles and expected order patterns from customers. If our estimates in these areas become inaccurate, we may not be able to meet our revenue goals and projections. In addition, some customers require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even some, of the product. As a result, in any quarterly fiscal period we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a fall-off of sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products that meet the customer's unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, and thus potential inventory write-offs. We routinely estimate inventory reserves required for such products, but actual results may differ from these reserve estimates.
We generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide and our revenues are diversified by end-market and geographical region. However, the loss of, or a significant reduction of purchases by a portion of our customer base could adversely affect our results of operations. We can lose a customer due to a change in the customer's design or purchasing practices. In addition, the timing of customers' inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations.
We may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products required to maintain or expand our business.
The markets for our products depend on continued demand for our products in the communications, industrial, computings, high-end consumer and automotive end-markets. The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, variations in manufacturing efficiencies of new products, and
significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development. New product introductions are a critical factor for future sales growth and sustained profitability and can present significant business challenges because product development commitments and expenditures must be made well in advance of the related revenues. The success of a new product depends on a variety of factors including accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological developments, timely and efficient completion of process design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, product performance, quality and reliability of the product, and effective marketing, sales and service.
Although we believe that the high performance segment of the linear integrated circuit market is generally less affected by price erosion or by significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development than other semiconductor market sectors, future operating results may reflect substantial period-to-period fluctuations due to these or other factors.
Our manufacturing operations may be interrupted or suffer yield problems.
We rely on our internal manufacturing facilities located in California and Washington to fabricate most of our wafers, although we depend on outside silicon foundries for a small portion (less than 5%) of our wafer fabrication. We could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake, which could cause temporary loss of capacity, loss of raw materials, and damage to manufacturing equipment. Additionally, we rely on our internal and external assembly and testing facilities located in Singapore and Malaysia. We are subject to economic and political risks inherent to international operations, including changes in local governmental policies, currency fluctuations, transportation delays and the imposition of export controls or increased import tariffs. We could be adversely affected if any such changes are applicable to our foreign operations.
Our manufacturing yields are a function of product design and process technology, both of which are developed by us. The manufacture and design of integrated circuits is highly complex. We may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of, among other things, capacity constraints, construction delays, upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues or increases in fixed costs. To the extent we do not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or there are delays in wafer fabrication, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, operating expenses related to increases in production capacity may adversely affect our operating results if revenues do not increase proportionately.
Our dependence on third party foundries and other manufacturing subcontractors may cause delays beyond our control in delivering our products to our customers.
A portion of our wafers (approximately 20%) are processed offshore by independent assembly subcontractors located in Malaysia and Thailand. These subcontractors separate wafers into individual circuits and assemble them into various finished package types. Reliability problems experienced by our assemblers could cause problems in delivery and quality, resulting in potential product liability to us. We could also be adversely affected by political disorders, labor disruptions, and natural disasters in these locations.
We are dependent on outside silicon foundries for a small portion (less than 5%) of our wafer fabrication. As a result, we cannot directly control delivery schedules for these products, which could lead to product shortages, quality assurance problems and increases in the cost of our products. We may experience delays in delivering our products to our customers. If these foundries are unable or unwilling to produce adequate supplies of processed wafers conforming to our quality standards, our business and relationships with our customers for the limited quantities of products produced by these foundries could be adversely affected. Finding alternate sources of supply or initiating internal wafer processing for these products may not be economically feasible. In addition, the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a highly controlled environment. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by a third party foundry could adversely affect the foundry's ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability.
 
We rely on third party suppliers for materials, supplies, and subcontract services that may not have adequate capacity to meet our product delivery requirements.
The semiconductor industry has experienced a very large expansion of fabrication capacity and production worldwide over time. As a result of increasing demand from semiconductor and other manufacturers, availability of certain basic materials and supplies, such as chemicals, gases, polysilicon, silicon wafers, ultra-pure metals, lead frames and molding compounds, and of subcontract services, like epitaxial growth, ion implantation and assembly of integrated circuits into packages, have from time to time, over the past several years, been in short supply and could come into short supply again if overall industry demand continues to increase in the future. In addition, from time to time natural disasters can lead to a shortage of some of the above materials due to disruption of the manufacturer's production. We do not have long-term agreements providing for all of these materials, supplies, and services, and shortages could occur as a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on suppliers that could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our planned production.
A number of our products use components that are purchased from third parties. Supplies of these components may not be sufficient to meet all customer requested delivery dates for products containing the components, which could adversely affect future sales and earnings. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the purchase price for these components could affect gross margins for the products involved. Suppliers could also discontinue the manufacture of such purchased products or could have quality problems that could affect our ability to meet customer commitments. In addition, suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment are sometimes unable to deliver test and/or fabrication equipment to a schedule or equipment performance specification that meets our requirements. Delays in delivery of equipment needed for growth could adversely affect our ability to achieve our manufacturing and revenue plans in the future.
We are exposed to business, economic, political and other risks through our significant worldwide operations.
During fiscal year 2006, 70% of our revenues were derived from customers in international markets. Also, we have test and assembly facilities outside the United States in Singapore and Malaysia. Accordingly, we are subject to the economic and political risks inherent in international operations and their impact on the United States economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United States and its allies.
We are subject to litigation risks, including litigation relating to allegations regarding our stock option granting practices.
We are subject to various legal proceedings arising out of a wide range of matters, including, among others, patent suits, securities issues and employment claims. From time to time, as is typical in the semiconductor industry, we receive notice from third parties alleging that our products or processes infringe the third parties' intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license, and one or more of our products or processes are determined to infringe intellectual property rights of others, a court might enjoin us from further manufacture and/or sale of the affected products. In that case, we would need to re-engineer the affected products or processes in such a way as to avoid the alleged infringement, which may or may not be possible. An adverse result in litigation arising from such a claim could involve an injunction to prevent the sales of a portion of our products, a reduction or the elimination of the value of related inventories, and/or the assessment of a substantial monetary award for damages related to past sales. We do not believe that our current lawsuits will have a material impact on our business or financial condition. However, current lawsuits and any future lawsuits will divert resources and could result in the payment of substantial damages. In addition, we may incur significant legal costs to assert our intellectual property rights when we believe our products or processes have been infringed by third parties.
 
We previously disclosed in press releases that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the United States Justice Department have initiated informal inquiries into our stock option granting practices. In addition, on September 5, 2006, we received an Information Document Request from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") concerning our stock option grants and grant practices. We are cooperating with the SEC, IRS and the Department of Justice. In addition, various of our current and former directors and officers have been named as defendants in two consolidated stockholder derivative actions filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned (N.D. Cal.) (the "Federal Action"); and three substantially similar consolidated stockholder derivative actions filed in California state court, captioned (Santa Clara County Superior Court) (the "State Action"). Plaintiffs in the Federal and State Actions allege that the defendant directors and officers backdated stock option grants during the period from 1997 through 2002. Both actions assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. The Federal Action also alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by allegedly violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, while the State Action also alleges that certain of the defendants aided and abetted one another's alleged breach of fiduciary duty, wasted corporate assets, engaged in insider trading in connection with the purportedly backdated option grants, in violation of the California Corporations Code. Both Actions seek to recover unspecified money damages, disgorgement of profits and benefits, equitable relief and attorneys' fees and costs. The State Action also seeks restitution, rescission of certain defendants' option contracts, and imposition of a constructive trust over the option contracts. We are named as a nominal defendant in both the Federal and State Actions, thus no recovery against us is sought. We have engaged its outside counsel to represent us in the government inquiries and pending lawsuits. We reviewed our historical option-granting practices and option grants with the assistance of outside counsel and an independent forensic accounting firm. The primary scope of the review covered the periods calendar year 1995 through 2006. Based on the findings of the review, we have concluded that there is no need to restate any previously filed financial statements. The review found no evidence of fraud or misconduct of any kind in our practices in granting of stock options.
In re Linear Technology Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation
In re Linear Technology Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation
We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may impact our ability to compete effectively.
Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new products and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive advantages. Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, copyright, maskwork and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries. We may incur significant legal costs to protect our intellectual property.
We also seek to protect our proprietary technology, including technology that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors' rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will always be undertaken or will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.
We have received, and may receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement and misappropriation of other parties' proprietary rights. In the event of an adverse decision in a patent, trademark, copyright, maskwork or trade secret action, we could be required to withdraw the product or products found to be infringing from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development. Whether or not these infringement claims are
 
successfully asserted, we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of these claims. In the event of an adverse outcome in any litigation, we may be required to pay substantial damages, including enhanced damages for willful infringement, and incur significant attorneys' fees, as well as indemnify customers for damages they might suffer if the products they purchase from us infringe intellectual property rights of others. We could also be required to stop our manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of some processes, or obtain licenses to intellectual property rights covering products and technology that we may, or have been found to, infringe or misappropriate such intellectual property rights.
The transition to lead-free products may adversely affect our results of operations.
Customers are requiring that we offer our products in lead-free packages. Governmental regulations in certain countries and customers' intention to produce products that are less harmful to the environment has resulted in a requirement from many of our customers to purchase integrated circuits that do not contain lead. We have responded by offering our products in lead-free versions. While the lead-free versions of our products are expected to be more friendly to the environment, the ultimate impact is uncertain. The transition to lead-free products may produce sudden changes in demand depending on the packaging method used, which may result in excess inventory of products packaged using traditional methods. This may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the quality, cost and manufacturing yields of the lead free products may be less favorable compared to the products packaged using more traditional materials which may result in higher costs to us.
Our products may contain defects that could affect our results of operations.
Our products may contain undetected errors or defects. Such problems may cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result in increased costs and diversion of development resources, cause us to incur increased charges due to obsolete or unusable inventory, require design modifications, or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with these products, which could result in product returns. In addition, we may not find defects or failures in our products until after commencement of commercial shipments, which may result in loss or delay in market acceptance and could significantly harm our operating results. Our current or potential customers also might seek to recover from us any losses resulting from defects or failures in our products; further, such claims might be significantly higher than the revenues and profits we receive from our products involved as we are usually a component supplier with limited value content relative to the value of a complete system or sub-system. Liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages for which we may have insufficient insurance coverage. Any of these claims, whether or not successful, could seriously damage our reputation and business.
If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.
Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of key officers, technical personnel or other key employees could harm the business. Our success depends on our ability to identify, hire, train, develop and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel could harm us.
We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.
We compete in the high performance segment of the linear market. Our competitors include among others, Analog Devices, Inc., Intersil, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., National Semiconductor Corporation and Texas Instruments, Inc. Competition among manufacturers of linear integrated circuits is intense, and certain of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. The principal elements of competition include product performance, functional value, quality and reliability,
 
technical service and support, price, diversity of product line and delivery capabilities. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, although it may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines and greater technical service and support capabilities.
Environmental liabilities could force us to expend significant capital and incur substantial costs.
Federal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the storage, use, discharge and disposal of certain chemicals and gases used in semiconductor processing. Our facilities have been designed to comply with these regulations, and we believe that our activities conform to present environmental regulations. Increasing public attention has, however, been focused on the environmental impact of electronics manufacturing operations. While we to date have not experienced any materially adverse business effects from environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such regulations will not require us to acquire costly remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with such regulations. Any failure by us to control the storage, use or disposal of, or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to significant liabilities.
Our financial results may be adversely affected by increased tax rates and exposure to additional tax liabilities.
As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate as well as the actual tax ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.
Our stock price may be volatile.
Although we believe that we have the product lines, manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for our current operations, revenues and profitability can be significantly affected by the above and other factors. Additionally, our common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and/or earnings fail to meet the expectations of the investment community. Furthermore, stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS LOWER REVENUE AND NET INCOME FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR AND ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR A $3.0 BILLION ACCELERATED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION.
Milpitas, California, April 17, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that revenue for its quarterly period ended April 1, 2007, was $255.0 million, a decrease of 9% or $23.9 million from revenue of $278.9 million for the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. Net income computed in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 of $98.6 million or $0.32 diluted earnings per share decreased 11% or $12.0 million from net income of $110.6 million or $0.35 diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of the previous fiscal year.
 
Sequentially, revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 of $255.0 million decreased 5% or $12.9 million from revenue of $267.9 million from the sequential December quarter. Net income computed in accordance with GAAP for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 was $98.6 million, or $0.32 diluted earnings per share, a decrease of 6% from GAAP net income of $105.0 million or $0.34 diluted earnings per share reported in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. During the most recent quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance increased $24.9 million over the second quarter of the current fiscal year net of spending $25.2 million to purchase 0.8 million shares of its common stock. A cash dividend of $0.18 per share will be paid on May 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on April 27, 2007.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007 was $111.8 million or $0.37 diluted earnings per share a decrease of $6.0 million from non-GAAP net income of $117.8 million or $0.39 diluted earnings per share reported from the sequential December quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, fiscal year 2007 third quarter non-GAAP net income of $111.8 million decreased 7% or $8.0 million from non-GAAP net income of $119.7 million for the third quarter of the previous fiscal year. The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results. Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "This was a difficult quarter for us in that quarterly revenue and net income were down both sequentially from the December quarter and from the similar quarter last year. However, Linear continues to be very profitable with a return on sales of 39%. In addition, the Company continues to have positive cash flow from operations. Moreover, orders placed on the Company increased during the quarter and we had a positive book to bill ratio. The upcoming June quarter is a challenge to accurately forecast. Although inventory in the marketplace appears to be more balanced than in previous quarters, visibility continues to be low and customers remain guarded in their forecasting and inventory management. In summary, we currently expect revenue to increase 3% to 6% with operating margins up similarly.
 
 
Linear Announces Plans for a $3 Billion Accelerated Stock Repurchase Transaction
The Company also announced its plans to enter into an accelerated stock repurchase transaction, subject to market and other conditions, pursuant to which it will repurchase approximately $3 billion of its shares of common stock. The Company intends to finance such repurchase with existing cash and the proceeds of a $1.7 billion convertible note offering. The accelerated stock repurchase transaction would be conditioned on the closing of the convertible note offering.
 
Robert H. Swanson, founder and Executive Chairman, said Over the last twenty-five years we have built a strong profitable analog franchise. During this period we have grown entirely organically without any Company acquisitions and have accumulated roughly $2.0 billion in cash. We believe that our best investment continues to be ourselves, Linear Technology Corporation. Accordingly, we plan to purchase $3.0 billion of Linear stock in this transaction.
 
This substantial share repurchase underscores our belief in Linears future said Lothar Maier, Linears CEO. Repurchasing stock at this time represents an opportunity to use our strong cash position, together with some leveraging of our strong cash flow, to enhance long-term shareholder value.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results. The Company excludes stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures. This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

On April 18, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation ("Linear") issued a press release with respect to the pricing of its offer and sale of $1.7 billion aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
On April 18, 2007, Linear issued a press release announcing it has entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction. A copy of this press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: April 18, 2007
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
MILPITAS, Calif.Linear Technology Corporation (NasdaqGS:LLTC) today announced that it has priced its offerings of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027 and $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027 to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The issuance of the notes is expected to close on April 24, 2007, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
Each series of notes will initially be convertible, subject to certain conditions, into cash up to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes or the conversion value. If the conversion value of the notes is greater than $1,000, then the excess conversion value will be convertible into cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at Linear's election. The initial effective conversion rate of the 3.00% notes is 20 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.00% notes (which is equivalent to an initial effective conversion price of approximately $50.00 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The initial effective conversion rate of the 3.125% notes is 19.8138 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 3.125% notes (which is equivalent to an initial effective conversion price of approximately $50.47 per share), subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. This represents a premium of approximately 38.7% and 40%, respectively, relative to the closing bid price of Linear's common stock on April 18, 2007. Each series of notes will bear contingent interest under certain circumstances. Linear may redeem the 3.00% notes for cash at any time on or after May 1, 2014 and holders may require Linear to repurchase the 3.00% notes for cash on specified dates and upon a fundamental change. Linear may redeem the 3.125% notes for cash at any time on or after November 1, 2010 and holders may require Linear to repurchase the 3.125% notes for cash on specified dates and upon a fundamental change.
Linear intends to use the entire net proceeds of this offering to fund a portion of its agreement to repurchase approximately $3 billion of its common stock through an accelerated stock repurchase transaction with an affiliate of the initial purchaser.
The initial purchaser has advised Linear that, in connection with the counterparty to the accelerated stock repurchase establishing its initial hedge of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, it expects such counterparty or its affiliate to enter into various derivative and/or common stock purchase transactions in secondary market transactions concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. This counterparty or its affiliate is likely to modify such hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Linear common stock and/or by purchasing or selling Linear common stock in secondary market transactions prior to final settlement of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction. In addition, during the term of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, which is expected to last approximately nine months, this counterparty or its affiliate will purchase shares of Linear common stock in connection with the accelerated stock repurchase transaction.
 
This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.
The securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. The notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, whether or not Linear will offer the notes or consummate the offering, the anticipated terms of the notes and the offering and the anticipated use of the proceeds of the offering.

Exhibit 99.2
MILPITAS, Calif.Linear Technology Corporation (NasdaqGS:LLTC) today announced that it has entered into an agreement to purchase $3 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock in a privately negotiated accelerated stock repurchase transaction with a third-party financial institution (the "repurchase counterparty"). The Company will finance the repurchases with existing cash and the proceeds of its recently announced convertible note offerings. The repurchase transaction will be conditioned on the closing of the Company's $1.7 billion convertible note offerings.
Robert H. Swanson, founder and Executive Chairman, said "Over the last twenty-five years we have built a strong profitable analog franchise. During this period we have grown entirely organically without any Company acquisitions and have accumulated roughly $2.0 billion in cash. We believe that our best investment continues to be ourselves, Linear Technology Corporation. Accordingly, we plan to purchase $3.0 billion of Linear stock in this transaction."
"This substantial share repurchase underscores our belief in Linear's future" said Lothar Maier, Linear's CEO. "Repurchasing stock at this time represents an opportunity to use our strong cash position, together with some leveraging of our strong cash flow, to enhance long-term shareholder value."
Under the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, the Company will purchase $3 billion of shares of Linear common stock from the repurchase counterparty, with the exact number of shares of Linear common stock with respect to the first $1.5 billion to be determined based on the daily volume weighted average price of Linear common stock over an approximately three month period expected to commence shortly after closing of the Company's $1.7 billion convertible note offerings and with the exact number for the remaining $1.5 billion to be determined based on the daily volume weighted average price of Linear common stock (subject to a per share floor price and cap price resulting in a purchase by the Company under that part of the accelerated stock repurchase program of no fewer than approximately 38.9 million shares of common stock and not more than approximately 42.5 million shares of common stock) over the subsequent approximately six month period. Pursuant to the terms of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, the repurchase counterparty will deliver to Linear the first approximately 47.2 million shares of Linear common stock purchased on April 24, 2007. In addition, on each of May 30, 2007 and June 30, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the accelerated share repurchase transaction, the repurchase counterparty will deliver to Linear approximately 12.5 million shares of Linear common stock. On each of these dates, the repurchased shares will be retired, and Linear's outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of shares repurchased. At the conclusion of the approximately three month period expected to commence shortly after closing of the Company's $1.7 billion convertible note offerings, as a purchase price adjustment of the prepayment with respect to the first portion of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, Linear may deliver to the repurchase counterparty, or the repurchase counterparty may deliver to
Linear, shares of Linear common stock. The number of shares of Linear common stock to be delivered in connection with such purchase price adjustment, and the party to whom such shares are delivered, will be determined based upon the volume weighted average price of Linear common stock over such three month period. Thereafter, at the conclusion of the subsequent approximately six month period, the repurchase counterparty will deliver to Linear the excess, if any, of the final number of shares to be repurchased under the second portion of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction over the aggregate number of shares of common stock previously delivered with respect to that portion of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction.
The repurchase counterparty has advised Linear that, in connection with establishing its initial hedge of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, it or its affiliate expects to enter into various derivative and/or common stock purchase transactions in secondary market transactions concurrently with or shortly after entering into the accelerated stock repurchase transaction. The repurchase counterparty or its affiliate is likely to modify such hedge position by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Linear common stock and/or by purchasing or selling Linear common stock in secondary market transactions prior to final settlement of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction. In addition, during the term of the accelerated stock repurchase transaction, which is expected to last approximately nine months, the repurchase counterparty or its affiliate will purchase shares of Linear common stock in connection with the accelerated stock repurchase transaction.
This press release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, whether or not Linear will consummate the accelerated stock repurchase transaction and various events that could result in early termination of the program.

On April 18, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation ("Linear") entered into agreements in connection with the following transactions: (1) the issuance of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027 (the "2027A Notes"), (2) the issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes due May 1, 2027 (the "2027B Notes" and, together with the 2027A Notes, the "Notes") and (3) the entry into an accelerated share repurchase transaction with an affiliate of the initial purchaser.
Issuance of the Notes
On April 18, 2007, Linear entered into a purchase agreement with an initial purchaser (the "Purchase Agreement") to offer and sell $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 2027A Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 2027B Notes, in a private placement to the initial purchaser for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), afforded by Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 144A under the Act.
On April 24, 2007, Linear closed the sale of the Notes. In connection with the closing, on April 24, 2007, Linear entered into an indenture (the "2027A Notes Indenture") with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), governing the 2027A Notes and issued global notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for The Depository Trust Corporation ("DTC"), and an indenture (the "2027B Notes Indenture" and, together with the 2027A Notes Indenture, the "Indentures") with the Trustee, governing the 2027B Notes and issued global notes in the aggregate principal amount of $700 million in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC.
Certain terms and conditions of the Indentures and the Notes governed thereby are as follows:
. The Notes mature on May 1, 2027.
Maturity
. The 2027A Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.00% per year. Interest on the 2027A Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007. The 2027B Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.125% per year. Interest on the 2027B Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 1, 2007.
Interest
. Beginning with the six-month period commencing on May 1, 2014 and ending on October 31, 2014, in the case of the 2027A Notes, and the six-month period commencing November 1, 2010 and ending on April 30, 2011, in the case of the 2027B Notes, and for each six-month period from May 1 to October 31 and from November 1 to April 30 thereafter, Linear will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for the applicable interest period if the average Trading Price (as defined in the applicable Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Notes during the five consecutive trading days ending three trading days before the applicable six-month period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes.
Contingent Interest
On any interest payment date when contingent interest is payable, the contingent interest payable per 2027A Note or 2027B Note, as the case may be, will equal 0.25% per year of the average Trading Price of such Note during the applicable five trading-day reference period.
. See description in Item 3.02 below.
Conversion Rights
. If a fundamental change (as defined in the Indentures) occurs, holders of the Notes may require Linear to purchase all or a portion of their Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being purchased, plus the applicable accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.
Purchase at Option of Holders Upon a Fundamental Change
. On May 1, 2014, May 1, 2017 and May 1, 2022 in the case of the 2027A Notes and on November 1, 2010, May 1, 2017 and May 1, 2022 in the case of the 2027B Notes (each a "specified purchase date"), holders may require Linear to purchase any outstanding Notes for which a holder has properly delivered and not withdrawn a written purchase notice for cash at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes being repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest and additional interest, if any) to, but not including, the specified purchase date.
Purchase at Option of Holders on Specified Dates
. Linear may redeem the 2027A Notes on and after May 1, 2014, and the 2027B Notes on and after November 1, 2010, in each case, on at least 20 days and no more than 60 days notice, in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest and additional interest, if any) to, but not including, the redemption date.
Optional Redemption by Linear
. The Notes are Linear's unsubordinated, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of Linear's other existing and future unsubordinated, unsecured obligations. The Notes rank junior in right of payment to any of Linear's secured obligations to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of Linear's subsidiaries.
Ranking
. The following constitute events of default under the Indentures that could, subject to certain conditions, cause the unpaid principal on the applicable Notes to become due and payable:
Events of Default
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In connection with the closing of the sale of the 2027A Notes, on April 24, 2007, Linear entered into a registration rights agreement
(the "2027A Notes Registration Rights Agreement") with the initial purchaser. In connection with the closing of the sale of the 2027B Notes, on April 24, 2007, Linear entered into a registration rights agreement (the "2027B Notes Registration Rights Agreement" and, together with the 2027A Notes Registration Rights Agreement, the "Registration Rights Agreements") with the initial purchaser.
Under each of the Registration Rights Agreements, Linear has agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the applicable Notes, to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the resale of the applicable Notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the applicable Notes not later than 120 days after the first date of original issuance of the applicable Notes and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such shelf registration statement to become effective not later than 180 days after the first date of original issuance of the applicable Notes. Linear also has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep such shelf registration statement continuously effective until the earliest of (1) two years from the latest date of original issuance of the applicable Notes, (2) the date when all registrable securities shall have been registered under the Act and disposed of, (3) the date on which all registrable securities held by non-affiliates are eligible to be sold to the public pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Act and (4) the date on which the registrable securities cease to be outstanding. Additional interest will accrue on the applicable Notes if (1) the applicable shelf registration statement has not been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") by the 120th day after the first date of original issuance of the applicable Notes, (2) if the applicable shelf registration statement has not become effective by the 180th day after the first date of original issuance of any of the applicable Notes and (3) after the applicable shelf registration statement has become effective, such applicable shelf registration statement ceases to be effective (without being succeeded immediately by an effective replacement applicable shelf registration statement), or the applicable shelf registration statement or prospectus contained therein ceases to be usable in connection with the resales of the applicable Notes and any common stock issuable upon the conversion of the applicable Notes, in accordance with and during the periods specified in the applicable Registration Rights Agreement for a period of time (including any suspension period) which exceeds 120 days in the aggregate in any consecutive 12-month period because either (i) any event occurs as a result of which the prospectus forming part of such shelf registration statement would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading, (ii) it shall be necessary to amend such shelf registration statement or supplement the related prospectus to comply with the Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or the respective rules thereunder or (iii) the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development or other material event with respect to Linear or a public filing with the SEC that, in Linear's reasonable discretion, makes it appropriate to suspend the availability of a shelf registration statement and the related prospectus.
Additional interest will accrue on the 2027A Notes or the 2027B Notes, as applicable, from and including the date on which the registration default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all such registration defaults have been cured, at the rate of (a) 0.25% of the principal amount of the 2027A Notes or the 2027B Notes, as applicable, per year to and including the 90th day following the occurrence of such registration default and (b) 0.50% of the principal amount of the 2027A Notes or 2027B Notes, as applicable, per year from and after the 91st day following such registration default.
If a holder has converted some or all of its Notes into common stock, the holder will not be entitled to receive any additional interest with respect to such common stock or the principal amount of the Notes converted.
The Notes have not been registered under the Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and state securities laws. This Current Report on Form 8-K is not an offer to sell the Notes nor is it soliciting an offer to buy the Notes.
Entry into Accelerated Share Repurchase Program
On April 18, 2007, Linear entered into two confirmations (the "confirmations") with an affiliate of the initial purchaser (the "repurchase counterparty") relating to an accelerated share repurchase program (the "Accelerated Share Repurchase Program"). Under the confirmations, Linear will purchase $3.0 billion of shares of Linear common stock from the repurchase counterparty, with the exact number of shares of Linear common stock with respect to the first $1.5 billion to be determined based on the daily volume weighted average price of Linear common stock over an approximately three-month period expected to commence shortly after closing of the Linear's $1.7 billion offering of the Notes and with the exact number for the remaining $1.5 billion to be determined based on the daily volume weighted average price of Linear common stock (subject to a per share floor price and cap price resulting in a purchase by Linear under that part of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Program of no fewer than approximately 38.9 million shares of common stock and not more than approximately 42.5 million shares of common stock) over the subsequent approximately six-month period.
Pursuant to the terms of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Program, the repurchase counterparty will deliver to Linear the first approximately 47.2 million shares of Linear common stock purchased on April 24, 2007. In addition, on each of May 30, 2007 and June 30, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Program, the repurchase counterparty will deliver to Linear approximately 12.5 million shares of Linear common stock. On each of these dates, the repurchased shares will be retired, and Linear's outstanding shares used to calculate earnings per share will be immediately reduced by the number of shares repurchased. At the conclusion of the approximately three-month period expected to commence shortly after closing of Linear's $1.7 billion offering of the Notes, as a purchase price adjustment of the prepayment with respect to the first portion of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Program, Linear may deliver to the repurchase counterparty, or the repurchase counterparty may deliver to Linear, shares of Linear common stock. The number of shares of Linear common stock to be delivered in connection with such purchase price adjustment, and the party to whom such shares are delivered, will be determined based upon the volume weighted average price of Linear common stock over such three-month period. Thereafter, at the conclusion of the subsequent approximately six-month period, the repurchase counterparty will deliver to Linear the excess, if any, of the final number of shares to be repurchased under the second portion of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Program over the aggregate number of shares of common stock previously delivered with respect to that portion of the Accelerated Share Repurchase Program.
The repurchase was funded with approximately $1.677 billion of net proceeds from the offering of the Notes and existing cash.
 
The information set forth in Items 1.01 and 3.02 hereof is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.
Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.
The information set forth in Item 1.01 hereof is incorporated by reference into this Item 3.02.
As disclosed above, on April 24, 2007, Linear issued and sold $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2027A Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027B Notes. The Notes were sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement in a private placement to an initial purchaser for resale to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemptions from the registration requirements of the Act afforded by Section 4(2) of the Act and Rule 144A under the Act. Linear expects to receive approximately $1.677 billion in proceeds after deducting the initial purchaser's discount of approximately $22.0 million and estimated offering expenses.
The Notes will be convertible only under certain circumstances, as described below, at an initial conversion rate of 20.00 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027A Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $50.00 per share), subject to adjustment as described in the 2027A Notes Indenture, and at an initial conversion rate of 19.8138 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027B Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $50.47 per share), subject to adjustment as described in the 2027B Notes Indenture. Upon conversion of a Note, a holder will receive cash in an amount equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount and the conversion value of the Note being converted (determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture) and, cash, shares of Linear's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Linear's common stock, at Linear's option, for the remainder, if any, of Linear's conversion obligation, in each case based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each trading day in the 20 trading-day conversion reference period.
Holders may convert their Notes prior to the close of business on the business day before the final maturity date based on the applicable conversion rate only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending June 30, 2007, if the closing price of Linear's common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days
ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 130% of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading-day period ("the measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the applicable Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the closing price of Linear's common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day, (3) if Linear has called such Notes for redemption, (4) upon the occurrence of specified distributions to holders of Linear's common stock or (5) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. In addition, holders may surrender Notes for conversion at any time during the period beginning on March 1, 2027 and ending at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Notes.
Upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes, each as specified in the applicable Indenture, Linear will increase the conversion rate as to the Notes converted in connection with such fundamental change, in each case as described in the applicable Indenture.
Linear intends to use all the net proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, to fund the prepayment of an accelerated share repurchase transaction to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock that Linear has entered into with an affiliate of the initial purchaser of the Notes.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Linear technology reports increased revenues and earnings per share over the prior quarter.  Revenues and earnings per share for the current fiscal year were similar to the prior fiscal year.  The text of the Companys press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

 
LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER. REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WERE SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.
 
 
Milpitas, California, July 24 2007, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended July 1, 2007.  Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased 5.1% to $268.1 million over third quarter revenues of $255.0 million and decreased 8% or $24.8 million from $292.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.36 increased $.04 a share over third quarter diluted EPS of $0.32 and decreased $.01 from $0.37 in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 of $95.7 million decreased $2.8 million or 2.9% from $98.6 million reported in the third quarter and decreased $20.0 million or 17% from $115.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  In April 2007, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt.  As a result the Company had both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense reducing pre tax income by $19.5 million. The Company retired 72.2 million shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 and expects to retire an additional 7.7 million shares during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Consequently, the transaction has been accretive to EPS as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the increased interest expense and reduced interest income.
Revenue for the year ended July 1, 2007 was $1.083 billion, a decrease of 1.0% from revenue of $1.093 billion for the previous fiscal year.  Diluted EPS for the twelve months ended July 1, 2007 was $.02 per share higher at $1.39 compared with $1.37 for the prior fiscal year.  Net income in accordance with GAAP for fiscal year 2007 of $411.7 million decreased $17.0 million or 4.0% from $428.7 million reported in the previous fiscal year.  Total cash dividends paid during fiscal year 2007 of $192.4 million increased $38.6 million or 25% over the prior fiscal year. A cash dividend of $0.18 per share will be paid on August 22, 2007 to stockholders of record on August 10, 2007.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 was $0.42 a $.05 per share increase over $0.37 reported from the sequential March quarter and $.01 per share increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income of $109.9 million decreased $1.8 million from $111.7 million in the third quarter and decreased $16.0 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006.  Fiscal year 2007 non-GAAP net income of $463.4 million decreased 1.0% or $3.5 million from non-GAAP net income of $466.9 million in the previous fiscal year. The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, "The Company ended the year on a positive note with sequential quarterly revenue growth of 5.1% and sequential earnings per share growth of 12.5%.  Moreover, orders placed on the Company increased during the quarter and we had a positive book to bill ratio. In addition, we are encouraged by the financial markets positive reaction to the Companys ASR discussed above and we feel that the Company is well positioned with its new capital structure.
 
Looking forward, although the summer or September quarter is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication infrastructure businesses, this should be offset by growing strength in consumer oriented businesses. In addition, our earnings per share will have a full quarter positive impact from the accelerated share repurchase because the increase in interest expense and lower interest income will be more than offset by the decrease in outstanding shares. Currently, we expect revenues in the September quarter to increase 4% to 6% from the June quarter and to have EPS increase more in the high end of this range.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2006.
 
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, July, 25 2007 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.   Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 955-1566 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.   There will be a live webcast of this conference call that can be accessed through or .

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, October 16, 2007, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 increased 5.0% to $281.5 million over the previous quarter revenue of $268.1 million and decreased 3.6% or $10.6 million from $292.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.40 increased $0.04 per share over fourth quarter diluted EPS of $0.36 per share and increased $0.03 per share over $0.37 per share reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Net income in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 of $91.5 million decreased $4.2 million or 4.4% from $95.7 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 largely due to an increase in net interest expense and an increase in the provision for income taxes. Net income decreased $20.9 million or 18.6% from $112.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.
 
In April 2007, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt.  As a result, the Companys first quarter results had both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense when compared to both last quarter and the first quarter of the prior fiscal year.  The first quarter of fiscal year 2008 had higher interest expense than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 due to the fourth quarter having two months of accrued interest versus three months in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS decreased by 37.2 million shares or 14% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Consequently, the ASR transaction has been accretive to EPS as the impact of the reduced shares was greater than the increase in interest expense and lower interest income.
 
A cash dividend of $0.18 per share will be paid on November 28, 2007 to stockholders of record on November 16, 2007.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $0.45 a $0.03 per share increase over $0.42 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.04 per share increase over the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  First quarter non-GAAP net income of $101.4 million decreased $8.5 million from $109.9 million in the fourth quarter and decreased $22.8 million from the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was a good September quarter for us. Revenue, EPS and cash generated from operations all increased and we had a positive book to bill ratio for the quarter. We are pleased with the results of the ASR which was partially responsible for the 11% increase in diluted EPS over the prior quarter which follows on a 12.5% sequential increase in diluted EPS in the quarter before that.
 
Looking ahead to the December quarter, growth will be impacted by the usual seasonal slowdown in our businesses.  Consequently,  we expect revenues and diluted EPS to increase in the 1% to 4% range from the September quarter just completed.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AND INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.18 TO $0.21 PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, January 15, 2008, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 30, 2007.  Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 increased 2.6% to $288.7 million over the previous quarters revenue of $281.5 million and increased 7.8% or $20.9 million over $267.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.41 increased $0.01 per share over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and increased $0.07 per share over the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Second quarter Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income of $93.8 million increased $2.3 million or 2.5% from $91.5 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Net income decreased $11.3 million or 10.7% from $105.0 million in the second quarter of last fiscal year primarily due to the increase in net interest expense as a result of the Companys issuance of convertible debt during fiscal year 2007. During the December quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance increased $54.5 million net of spending $32.1 million to purchase 1.0 million shares of its common stock.
 
The Company also increased its dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.21 per share for the quarter.  This cash dividend will be paid on February 27, 2008 to stockholders of record on February 15, 2008.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $0.46 per share, a $0.01 per share increase over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 and a $0.07 per share increase over the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Second quarter non-GAAP net income of $104.0 million increased $2.6 million over $101.4 million in the first quarter and decreased $13.8 million from the second quarter of fiscal year 2007.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, The Company grew revenues sequentially 2.6% in the December quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter that the Company has sequentially grown revenues.  In the same time period the Company has grown EPS faster than revenues.  We are pleased with the Companys results as we have grown revenues, sustained our margins, lowered our outstanding shares by 25%, grown EPS and increased our quarterly dividend by 17%.
 
Looking ahead, given the concerns about economic difficulties particularly in the USA, March is a challenging quarter to forecast. From a Linear specific point of view, March should be a good growth quarter. We had a positive book to bill ratio in the December quarter and we would expect the March quarter to have strength in the industrial and communication end markets to more than offset the normal seasonal softness in the consumer end market. However, the overriding general economic conditions merit concern. Consequently, we presently estimate that revenues and earnings will grow 1% to 5% sequentially from the December quarter.

A cash dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on May 28, 2008 to stockholders of record on May 16, 2008.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $0.49 per share, a $0.03 per share increase over the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 and a $0.12 per share increase over the third quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Third quarter non-GAAP net income of $110.0 million increased $6.0 million over $104.0 million in the second quarter and decreased $1.8 million from the third quarter of fiscal year 2007.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, The Company grew revenues and EPS sequentially by 3.2% and 7%, respectively, in the March quarter.  This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that the Company has sequentially grown revenues, operating margin and EPS.  These improvements have occurred in spite of difficult economic times. This speaks to our strategy of diversification both geographically and by end-market as we have seen strength internationally and in the industrial and communication end-markets.
 
Looking ahead, given the concerns about economic difficulties particularly in the USA, forecasting future results continues to be a challenge. June should be a growth quarter as we had a positive book to bill ratio in the March quarter and we would expect the June quarter to continue to have strength in many of our end-markets. However, the overriding general economic conditions merit concern. Consequently, we estimate that revenues and income before taxes will grow 1% to 5% sequentially from the March quarter.

In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY ACHIEVES RECORD QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, July 22, 2008, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter and year ended June 29, 2008.  Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 increased 3.1% to a quarterly record of $307.1 million compared to the previous quarters revenue of $297.9 million and increased 14.5% or $39.0 million over $268.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.46 increased $0.02 per share or 4.5% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and increased $0.10 per share or 28% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Fourth quarter Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income of $103.1 million increased $3.9 million or 3.9% over $99.2 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Net income for the quarter was positively impacted by the increase in sales,  a lower tax rate as a result of a discrete tax benefit and also by a modest gain from the sale of a strategic investment in a private company. These gains were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses. Net income increased $7.4 million or 7.8% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.
 
During the June quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance increased $58.8 million net of spending $48.3 million to purchase approximately 1.3 million shares of its common stock.  A cash dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on August 27, 2008 to stockholders of record on August 15, 2008.
 
Revenue for the year ended June 29, 2008 was $1.175 billion, an increase of 8.5% or $92.1 million over revenue of $1.083 billion for the previous fiscal year.  Diluted EPS for the year ended June 29, 2008 was $1.71, an increase of 23.0% or $0.32 per share over fiscal year 2007 diluted EPS of $1.39.  The Company entered into a $3.0 billion Accelerated Stock Repurchase (ASR) transaction at the end of fiscal year 2007 that along with the increase in sales drove the significant increase in EPS during fiscal 2008.  The ASR transaction decreased shares used in the calculation of diluted EPS by 83.3 million shares or by approximately 27%.  Net income in accordance with GAAP of $387.6 million for fiscal year 2008 decreased $24.1 million or 5.8% from $411.7 million reported in the previous fiscal year.  As mentioned above, in April 2007 the Company entered into a $3.0 billion ASR transaction funded by $1.3 billion of the Companys own cash and $1.7 billion of convertible debt.  As a result, the Companys fiscal year 2008 results had both a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense when compared to the prior fiscal year which resulted in lower net income in fiscal year 2008 but higher diluted EPS.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 was $0.51 per share, a $0.02 per share increase over the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and a $0.09 per share increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  Fourth quarter non-GAAP net income of $114.4 million increased $4.4 million over $110.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and $4.5 million over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We met our guidance set at the beginning of the quarter by growing revenues 3% and EPS 5% over the March quarter.  We have now grown revenues and EPS for five consecutive quarters.  We grew annual revenues 9% and EPS 23% and outperformed our competitors in what most people would call a tough economic environment.  Our strategy of diversification by geography and end-markets, emphasizing more traditional Linear end-markets, contributed to our record annual revenues and EPS.
 
Looking ahead, given the concerns about economic difficulties particularly in the USA, forecasting future results continues to be a challenge.  While we had a positive book to bill ratio for the June quarter, the summer or September quarter is typically a slow quarter for industrial and communication infrastructure business. However, we expect the September quarter to have some strength in certain high-end consumer end-markets. Consequently, we presently estimate that revenues and income before taxes will be flat to up 2% sequentially from the June quarter.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, October 14, 2008, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 28, 2008.  Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 increased 1% to a quarterly record of $310.4 million compared to the previous quarters revenue of $307.1 million and increased 10% or $28.9 million over $281.5 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.48 increased $0.02 per share or 4% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and increased $0.08 per share or 20% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.  First quarter Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net income of $107.6 million increased $4.5 million or 4% over $103.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Net income for the quarter was positively impacted by a lower tax rate as a result of a discrete tax benefit.  Net income increased $16.1 million or 18% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.
 
During the September quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance increased $55.2 million to $1.0 billion, net of spending $23.1 million to purchase approximately 737,000 shares of its common stock.  A cash dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on November 26, 2008 to stockholders of record on November 14, 2008.
 
Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $0.53 per share, a $0.02 per share increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and a $0.08 per share increase over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.  First quarter non-GAAP net income of $118.4 million increased $4.0 million over $114.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and $17.0 million over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.  The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  Reconciliations of reported net income and reported net income per diluted share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, respectively, are included at the end of this press release.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We met our guidance set at the beginning of the quarter by growing revenues and pretax income by 1% and 3%, respectively, over the June quarter.  This marks the sixth consecutive quarter that the Company has grown revenues and EPS.  However, during the latter part of the September quarter and especially through early October, the Company began to see a decrease in new order bookings across all of the Companys end-markets.We believe the current credit crisis and related economic uncertainty have begun to affect the semiconductor industry.
 
 
Looking ahead to the December quarter, given the decrease in recent orders and the softness we are currently seeing in the industry, we estimate that the Companys revenues will decline sequentially in the 10% to 20% range from the September quarter.  It is difficult to forecast what the decline in revenues will be given the uncertain state of the economy as a whole. Our results will be very dependent on our customers reaction to the global crisis.  Nevertheless, the Company is well positioned to manage through difficult times and has a proven track record that it can maintain industry leading profitability under challenging market conditions.  Many of our expenses are variable and we are taking measures to adjust those downward. Accordingly, we believe we can maintain pretax profits above 40% of sales with the lower forecasted sales range.  In addition, once this global economic crisis eases, we continue to be optimistic about the Companys long-term growth prospects.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On January 13, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation issued a press release titled Linear Technology reports quarterly and year over year decreases in revenues and earnings per share and increases its quarterly dividend.  The text of the Companys press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES TO REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AND INCREASES ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND.
Milpitas, California, January 13, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 28, 2008.  Revenue of $249.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 decreased 20% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $310.4 million and decreased 14% or $39.5 million from $288.7 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.38 decreased $0.10 per share or 21% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and decreased $0.03 per share or 7% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Net income of $84.2 million decreased $23.4 million or 21.8% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 and decreased $9.6 million or 10.2% from the second quarter of fiscal 2008.
 
Results for the December quarter were impacted by four unusual items:
 
 
 
 
           During the December quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance decreased by $121.7 million to $900.2 million, net of spending approximately $179.0 million to purchase $200.0 million face value of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes.
 
The Company is also increasing its quarterly dividend from $0.21 per share to $0.22 per share.  The Company has raised its dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 1992.  The Company believes that raising its dividend is an important way to return value to its shareholders. This cash dividend will be paid on February 25, 2009 to stockholders of record on February 13, 2009.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, Entering the quarter there was greater than usual uncertainty in our revenue guidance in light of the global credit crisis.  We continued to see further weakness in our bookings throughout the quarter and as a result, our revenue declined to the low end of our guidance.  We reacted to this weakness by reducing labor and related costs through headcount reductions, weekly plant closures and otherwise limiting operating expenditures where possible.  In addition, we took advantage of depressed market prices on our outstanding debt and repurchased $200 million of our convertible bonds resulting in a gain of approximately $21 million.  Partially offsetting the favorable impact on earnings from these items is the effect of severance costs and the acceleration of employee stock options that are significantly underwater.  Despite the significant reduction in revenues, we were able to continue to deliver pre-tax profits in excess of 40% during such a difficult period.
 
Looking ahead to the March quarter, we believe we have not yet seen the bottom from the economic fallout of the global credit crisis as our bookings continue to be weak in the early part of this quarter.  At this time it is difficult to forecast when we will see some stabilization and subsequent recovery.  Our current estimate anticipates that our third fiscal quarter revenues will be down in the 15% to 20% range from the second quarter. In order to meet these expectations, turnable bookings in February and March will need to exceed the depressed December and January run rate.  Nevertheless, we will continue to control costs where possible and make adjustments to our operations as necessary to mitigate the effect of declining revenues.  However, pre-tax profits are likely to fall into the low to mid thirties range as a percentage of net sales and around 40% of net sales on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. We anticipate having industry leading profitability as we successfully navigate through this difficult period.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008.
 
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, January 14, 2009 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.   Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 325-4759, or toll free (877) 718-5095 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.   There will be a live webcast of this conference call that can be accessed through or .  A replay of the conference call will be available from January 14, 2009 through January 20, 2009.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REVISES THE CHARGE TAKEN FOR ACCELERATING THE VESTING OF ALL OUT-OF-THE-MONEY STOCK OPTIONS AND ISSUES REVISED SECOND QUARTER 2009 RESULTS INCREASING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY $0.05.
Milpitas, California, February 6, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today announced that its previously reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 ended December 28, 2008 have been revised to exclude a non-cash charge of $15.0 million pertaining to accelerating the vesting of stock options for 1.4 million shares representing all of the out-of-the-money stock options previously awarded to its non-officer and non-director employees under its stock option plans.  The effect of this change in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the second quarter and the first six month period of fiscal year 2009 was to increase GAAP operating income by $15.0 million, GAAP net income by $11.0 million and to increase GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.05.  For the reconciliation between the previously announced results on January 13, 2009 and the revised results, see Table 1 for the impact to the Consolidated Statements of Income, and Table 2, for the impact to the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. These revised results will be included in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 28, 2008 filed this afternoon.
 
In the Companys press release dated January 13, 2009, the Company announced its quarterly results for the second quarter ended December 28, 2008. While in the process of performing quarterly review procedures in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standard No. 100 (SAS 100), the Companys independent registered public accounting firm had not taken exception to the Companys accounting and disclosure of its treatment of the acceleration of stock options prior to the issuance of the Companys press release.  In its release the Company stated that The Company accelerated the vesting of all out-of-the-money stock options previously awarded to its non-officer and non-director employees under its stock option plans. The unvested options to purchase approximately 1.4 million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration on December 17, 2008. The additional non-cash charge to the income statement as a result of the acceleration totaled $15.0 million.  This incremental charge increased Cost of Sales by $2.3 million; Research and Development expense by $7.5 million; and Selling, General and Administrative expense by $5.2 million.
 
Subsequent to the issuance of the press release and prior to the completion of its SAS 100 review of the second fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2008, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm informed the Company that it believed the Companys accounting treatment for the option acceleration did not comply with SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, (FAS 123(R)).
 
The Company has been advised by its independent registered public accounting firm that it and other large registered public accounting firms, who we understand do not all share the same views on this issue, are jointly in the process of seeking the views of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with respect to the application of certain provisions of FAS123(R), specifically to treatment of accelerating the vesting of out-of-the-money stock options.  We understand that the meeting between the SEC and the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as well as the other large registered public accounting firms, is occurring to provide clarity in the application of these certain provisions.
 
The Company has nevertheless decided not to wait for the SECs decision as the Company has chosen to file its Form 10-Q within the legal deadline of 40 calendar days. Accordingly, the Company has revised its second quarter fiscal 2009 results to eliminate the $15.0 million non-cash charge related to these options.  The $15.0 million charge will now be recognized over the next 2.5 years.   As a result of this change, the non-cash charge for all stock-based compensation was approximately $14.7 million in the just completed second fiscal quarter and is estimated to approximate $18 million in the current March quarter.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES TO REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE
Milpitas, California, April 14, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 29, 2009.  Revenue of $200.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 decreased 19% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $249.2 million and decreased 33% or $97.0 million from $297.9 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 decreased $0.18 per share or 42% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, which had benefited from a $21.0 million gain, or $0.07 diluted EPS, on the early retirement of debt. EPS decreased $0.19 per share or 43% from the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Net income of $54.5 million decreased $40.7 million or 43% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and decreased $44.8 million or 45% from the third quarter of fiscal year 2008.
 
Major factors impacting the March quarter were:
 
 
 
 
In summary, although revenues declined 19% this quarter and 20% last quarter, the Company remained strongly profitable with operating income of 36.4% of sales.
 
During the March quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance increased by $19.8 million to $920.0 million, net of spending approximately $28.3 million to purchase $30 million face value of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes.  A cash dividend of $0.22 per share will be paid on May 27, 2009 to stockholders of record on May 15, 2009.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, With revenues down 19% from the previous quarter, it was another difficult quarter as the Company continued to experience the fallout from the ongoing global credit crisis.  Nevertheless, the Companys results were within the range of its guidance.  The Company continued to control its variable expenses where possible to reduce the impact on profits from the decline in revenues.  As a result, the Company delivered pre-tax profits of 34% and maintained positive cash flow during this turbulent period.
 
Looking ahead to the June quarter, there is continued uncertainty in the marketplace and our customers continue to be cautious with their ordering patterns.  Forecasting operating results in the current environment is difficult, particularly since lead times are shorter than usual as customers tend to order only what they need urgently.  However, we are encouraged going into the fourth quarter as we expect to see some stability in customer bookings.  Our book to bill ratio was slightly positive in the March quarter.  Accordingly, our current estimate anticipates that our fourth quarter revenues will be down 2% to up 4% over the third quarter.  In order to meet these expectations, turns business, or bookings that are recorded and shipped during the quarter, will need to remain at a high level as customers order to current demand.  Also, we will continue to control costs where possible.  Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we reduced our workforce by approximately 130 employees to further reduce our cost structure.   Over the past few quarters in addition to layoffs we have substantially reduced variable compensation benefits and have taken other actions to reduce labor costs.  We appreciate the sacrifices our employees have made in this regard to limit further workforce reductions.  These tight expense controls we expect will allow the Company to maintain pre-tax profits in the low to mid thirties range as a percentage of net sales.
 
 Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008.
 
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 15, 2009 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.   Those investors wishing to listen in may call (719) 325-4755, or toll free (877) 852-6561 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On July 21, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation issued a press release titled Linear Technology reports increased revenues and net income over the prior quarter.  However, fiscal year revenues and net income both decreased from the prior year.  The text of the Companys press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS INCREASED REVENUES AND NET INCOME OVER THE PRIOR QUARTER.  HOWEVER, FISCAL YEAR REVENUES AND NET INCOME BOTH DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.
Milpitas, California, July 21, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 28, 2009.  Revenue of $208.0 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 increased 4% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $200.9 million and decreased 32% or $99.1 million from $307.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 was flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, which benefited from a lower tax rate of 19.5% compared to the current quarters tax rate of 23.0%.  In addition, the current quarter had a restructuring charge of $2.3 million compared to no charge for the prior quarter.  EPS decreased $0.21 per share or 46% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.  Net income of $56.2 million increased $1.8 million or 3% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 and decreased $46.9 million or 45% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.
 
Revenue for the year ended June 28, 2009 was $968.5 million, a decrease of 18% or $206.7 million from revenue of $1.175 billion for the previous fiscal year.  Diluted EPS for the year ended June 28, 2009 was $1.41, a decrease of 18% or $0.30 per share from fiscal year 2008 diluted EPS of $1.71.  Net income for fiscal year 2009 decreased $74.1 million or 19% from $387.6 million reported in the previous fiscal year.
 
During the June quarter the Companys cash and short-term investments balance decreased by $51.3 million to $868.7 million, net of spending approximately $62.8 million to purchase $64.4 million face value of its 3.125% Convertible Senior Notes.  A cash dividend of $0.22 per share will be paid on August 26, 2009 to stockholders of record on August 14, 2009.
 
Major factors impacting the June quarter were:
 
 
 
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, Revenues improved over the previous quarter as we grew sales 4%; however, we are still in a global recession. We continue to control our variable expenses where possible to reduce the impact on profits due to lower year-over-year revenues. Because of these cost saving measures, operating margin was 38% for the fourth quarter which was an improvement over 36.4% reported in the prior quarter.
 
It was a difficult year in which the Company saw record quarterly revenues of $310.4 million in the first quarter and then the subsequent three quarters had substantial year-over-year revenue declines. The actions taken by the Company and the sacrifices made by its employees enabled the Company to maintain its industry leading profitability margins despite one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression.
 
Looking ahead to the September quarter, there is continued uncertainty in the marketplace and our customers continue to be cautious with their ordering patterns.  Forecasting operating results in the current environment is difficult, particularly since lead times are shorter than usual as customers tend to order only what they urgently need . However, customers have become more consistent in their ordering patterns and we have seen some improvement in the automotive and recently the industrial end markets. Our book to bill ratio was positive in the June quarter.  Accordingly, although the summer quarter is historically a slow quarter for the Company, we are coming off a recession impacted lower sales base and expect this year that first quarter revenues will be up 2% to 5% over the fourth quarter.  In order to meet these expectations, turns business, or bookings that are recorded and shipped during the quarter, will need to remain at a high level as customers order to current demand.  The Company will continue to maintain tight expense controls and we expect to maintain operating margins in the upper thirties range as a percentage of net sales.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008.

(ii)
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Executive is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of Executives termination (other than due to death), then the Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits that are payable within the first six (6) months following Executives separation from service shall become payable on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Executives separation from service.  All subsequent Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits, if any, shall be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Executive dies following Executives separation from service but prior to the six (6) month anniversary of the separation, then any payments delayed in accordance with this paragraph shall be payable in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the date of Executives death and all other Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits shall be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.  Each payment and benefit payable under this Agreement is intended to constitute separate payments for purposes of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
 
 
(iii)
 
Any amount paid under this Agreement that satisfies the requirements of the short-term deferral rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations shall not constitute Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits for purposes of clause (i) above.
 
 
(iv)
 
Any amount paid under this Agreement that qualifies as a payment made as a result of an involuntary separation from service pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations that do not exceed the Section 409A Limit (as defined below) shall not constitute Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits for purposes of clause (i) above.
 
(v)
 
The foregoing provisions are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the severance payments and benefits to be provided hereunder shall be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted to so comply.  The Company and Executive agree to work together in good faith to consider amendments to this Agreement and to take such reasonable actions which are necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition prior to actual payment to Executive under Section 409A.
5.
 
.  In the event of a Change of Control (as defined herein), Executive shall receive the benefits specified in Section 4(a) above (including 75% vesting acceleration); provided that the Severance Payment shall be payable in a lump-sum within five (5) days following the Change of Control and the COBRA coverage shall beextended to Executive upon any subsequent termination of his employment, whether or not for Cause or Good Reason.  In the event Executives tenure as the Companys Chief Executive Officer terminates following a Change of Control, for any or no reason, Executive shall not be entitled to any additional compensation (except as to amounts already earned and payments and benefits due pursuant to Section 4(a)).
Change of Control Benefits
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.
 
.  In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Executive (i) constitute parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) but for this Section 6, would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then Executives benefits under Section 4 and Section 5 respectively shall be either:
Golden Parachute Excise Taxes
 
(a)
 
delivered in full, or
 
 
whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the excise tax imposed by Section 4999, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  If a reduction in severance and other benefits constituting parachute payments is necessary so that benefits are delivered to a lesser extent, reduction shall occur in the following order:: reduction of cash payments; cancellation of awards granted contingent on a change in ownership or control (within the meaning of Code Section 280G); cancellation of accelerated vesting of equity awards; reduction of employee benefits.  In the event that acceleration of vesting of equity award compensation is to be reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Executives equity awards.
 
Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 6 shall be made in writing by the Companys independent auditors who are primarily used by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control (the Accountants).  For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 6, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section.  The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 6.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On October 13, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation issued a press release titled Linear Technology reports strong quarterly revenues and profits with revenues growing 14% sequentially from the prior quarter.  The text of the Companys press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
ITEM 9.01.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS STRONG QUARTERLY REVENUES AND PROFITS WITH REVENUES GROWING 14% SEQUENTIALLY FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, October 13, 2009, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 27, 2009.  Revenue of $236.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 increased $28.1 million or 14% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $208.0 million and decreased $74.2 million or 24% from $310.4 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.  Net income of $60.7 million increased $9.3 million or 18% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 and decreased $41.6 million or 41% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 which in addition to higher revenue had a lower tax rate of 24% compared to 28% this quarter.
 
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased $0.04 cents per share over the adjusted fourth quarter fiscal year 2009 results. Diluted EPS of $0.27 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and included $7.2 million ($0.02 per share) of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on the Companys Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1), which the Company adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.  FSP APB 14-1 requires that issuers of debt instruments, such as the Companys Convertible Senior Notes, must separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The resulting non-cash interest expense will never be paid by the Company.  All adjustments were made retrospectively as of the April 24, 2007 issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and, therefore, all prior quarters and years have been adjusted accordingly.
 
In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the Company adopted EITF 03-6-1 which caused basic and diluted shares used in the Diluted EPS calculation to increase by approximately 4.0 million shares ($0.005 per share) to include non vested restricted stock grants that receive a dividend.  Diluted EPS was also negatively impacted by the return of the Companys quarterly tax rate to 28% as compared to the previous quarters tax rate of 21%, which was favorably impacted by discrete items.
 
During the September quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased by $40.8 million to $909.5 million.  A cash dividend of $0.22 per share will be paid on November 25, 2009 to stockholders of record on November 13, 2009.
 
Bookings for the quarter grew in all of the Companys major end-markets, except cell phones, and the largest increases were in the automotive and industrial end-markets.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was a strong quarter in both revenue and profit growth. We were pleased by the acceleration of customer orders during the latter half of the quarter as each of our end-markets except cell phone improved, in particular the automotive and industrial markets. As a result, revenues significantly improved over the previous quarter as we grew sales 14%, beating the top end of our guidance.  In addition, our operating income grew by 26% and now represents 42% of sales.  I would also like to recognize our dedicated employees who are helping us work successfully through these challenging times.
 
Notwithstanding the high rate of growth we achieved during the first quarter, we still remain somewhat cautious looking ahead to the December quarter.  The financial effects of the global recession are certainly not over and continue to impact many of our customers.  Customer orders continue to call for short lead times and turns business, or bookings that are recorded and shipped during the quarter, remains at a high level. While there are some concerns that recent improvements in the overall marketplace are at least partially attributable to a replenishment of inventory stock, we continue to experience bookings improvement. Therefore, based upon the strength of our positive book to bill ratio and the recovery we appear to be witnessing in our automotive and industrial end-markets, we are forecasting revenue growth for our second fiscal quarter in the range of 2% to 5% over our first quarter.
 
 Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES IN REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFITS WITH REVENUES GROWING 9% SEQUENTIALLY FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER. THE COMPANY IS ALSO RAISING ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND GUIDING FOR CONTINUED STRONG SALES GROWTH IN THE THIRD QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, January 12, 2010, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 27, 2009.  Revenue of $256.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 increased $20.2 million or 9% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $236.1 million and increased $7.2 million or 3% over $249.2 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.  Net income of $75.5 million increased $14.8 million or 24% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and decreased $10.7 million or 12% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 which had a gain on the early retirement debt of $14.6 million and a lower tax rate of 20.7% compared to 24.5% this quarter.
 
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.33 increased $0.06 cents per share over the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and decreased $0.05 cents per share from the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. Diluted EPS was calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and included $7.3 million ($0.02 per share) of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on the Companys Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1), which the Company adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.   All adjustments were made retrospectively as of the April 24, 2007 issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and, therefore, all prior quarters and years have been adjusted accordingly.
 
During the December quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased by $33.0 million to $942.5 million.  The Company is increasing its quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.23 per share.  This marks the 18 consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend.  The cash dividend of $0.23 per share will be paid on February 24, 2010 to stockholders of record on February 12, 2010.
th
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, The Company began to recover from the global recession in the first quarter, but we continued to be relatively cautious as we entered the second quarter given the economic climate and level of uncertainty among our customers.  However, the recovery continued throughout the second quarter and we experienced stronger than expected bookings with particular strength in the industrial, communication and computer end-markets.   This allowed us to beat the high end of our second quarter revenue guidance as we grew revenues $20.2 million or 9% sequentially.  In addition, higher gross margins and tight operating expense controls resulted in a 16% increase in our operating income, thereby increasing our operating margin to 45.1% of sales, up from 42.2% last quarter.
 
Our factories continue to execute well, enabling us to maintain low lead times which allows our customers to place orders on us close to their demand requirements.  Strong second quarter bookings and a related postive book-to-bill ratio that was higher than we have experienced in the past several quarters, leads us to be optimistic as we enter our third quarter.  As a result, we are forecasting revenue growth for our third fiscal quarter in the range of 7% to 10% over our second fiscal quarter.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY REVENUES AND CONTINUES TO GUIDE FOR STRONG SALES GROWTH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, April 13, 2010, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 28, 2010.  Record quarterly revenues of $311.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 increased $55.0 million or 21% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $256.4 million and increased $110.4 million or 55% over $200.9 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.  Net income of $100.6 million increased $25.1 million or 33% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $51.3 million or 104% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 which had a lower tax rate of 17.2% compared to 27.0% this quarter.
 
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.44 increased $0.11 cents per share or 33% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $0.22 cents per share or 100% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. Diluted EPS was calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and included $7.4 million ($0.02 per share) of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount on the Companys Convertible Senior Notes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. APB 14-1 (FSP APB 14-1), which the Company adopted retrospectively during the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.  All adjustments were made as of the April 24, 2007 issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and, therefore, all prior quarters and years have been adjusted accordingly.
 
During the March quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $79.6 million to $1.0 billion. A cash dividend of $0.23 per share will be paid on May 26, 2010 to stockholders of record on May 14, 2010.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We are extremely pleased with our strong fiscal third quarter results as the Company has achieved record revenues and increased quarterly EPS significantly on a sequential and year-over-year basis. As a result, we have recovered from the recent global economic downturn more quickly than anticipated.  Our growth has been broad-based with bookings up sharply in all of our major geographic regions and in each of our end-markets.  Bookings remained strong throughout the quarter and our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was once again firmly positive.  Though it is likely that certain customers may have begun to restock inventory from unsustainably low levels, or have reacted to longer lead times within the industry, we believe that new programs at both new and existing customers as well as expanding end-customer demand at continuing programs have been the primary catalyst for our current growth.  Inventories in the distribution channel are still relatively lean and inventory turns remain higher than normal.  Looking ahead we remain upbeat about our growth prospects and currently believe we can continue to keep our lead times at modest levels of 4 to 6 weeks and grow revenues another 7% - 10% in our fiscal fourth quarter.
 
 Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2009.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS ITS SECOND CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF RECORD QUARTERLY REVENUES BY GROWING 18% OVER THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 WHILE REVENUE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010 GREW 21% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.
Milpitas, California, July 20, 2010, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 27, 2010.  Record quarterly revenues of $366.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 increased $54.8 million or 18% compared to the previous quarters revenue of $311.3 million and increased $158.1 million or 76% over $208.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.  Fourth quarter net income of $124.5 million included a non-cash charge of $10.5 million, ($0.03 per diluted share) on the early retirement of a portion of the Companys senior convertible notes.  Consequently, net income increased $23.9 million or 24% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $73.1 million or 142% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 which had a lower tax rate of 21.5% compared to 26.0% this quarter.
 
Diluted earning per share (EPS) of $0.54 in the fourth quarter increased $0.10 per share or 23% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $0.31 per share or 135% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Net income was calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and included $7.1 million ($0.02 per share) of non-cash interest expense and $10.5 million ($0.03 per share) of non-cash loss on the early retirement of a portion of the Companys senior convertible notes.
 
Revenue for the year ended June 27, 2010 was $1.17 billion, an increase of 21% or $201.5 million over revenue of $968.5 million for the previous fiscal year. Net income of $361.3 million for fiscal year 2010 increased $72.1 million or 25% over $289.2 million reported in the previous fiscal year. Diluted EPS for the year ended June 27, 2010 was $1.58, an increase of 23% or $0.30 per share over the prior fiscal year.
 
During the fourth quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $64.0 million to $958.1 million, net of spending $154.2 million to retire $154.9 million principle amount of the 3.0% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2014.  A cash dividend of $0.23 per share will be paid on August 25, 2010 to stockholders of record on August 13, 2010.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, One year ago as we entered fiscal 2010 we were starting to recover from a global recession and there were concerns about the sustainability of the recovery.  However, our recovery from the steep decline we experienced in fiscal 2009 was surprisingly rapid as we delivered four very strong quarters of sequential growth, reaching record revenues in our fiscal third quarter and again handily beating that mark in the fourth quarter.  Our growth was broad-based across all regions and end-markets, most notably in the automotive, industrial and computer end-markets.  Our team did a tremendous job of adeptly changing course from a depressed market to one of strong growth.  We continued to closely manage expenses and our rate of profitability improved, culminati ng in operating margin of 53.1% of sales achieved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.  We are exiting fiscal 2010 with a high degree of confidence as we believe we are in an excellent position to grow our business.
 
We had another good bookings quarter with a firmly positive book to bill ratio and orders continue to be strong at the start of the current quarter.  While some bookings strength may be due to expanding lead times industry-wide, we continue to believe that the primary catalysts for our current growth are an increase in our customer base, the commencement of new programs at existing customers and an increase in end customer demand for existing programs.  Though our first fiscal quarter is traditionally a slower growth quarter for the Company, we currently believe we can grow revenues in the 4% to 7% range sequentially for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS ITS THIRD CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF RECORD QUARTERLY REVENUES BY GROWING 6% OVER THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010.
Milpitas, California, October 12, 2010, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 26, 2010.  Record quarterly revenues of $388.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased $22.4 million or 6% over the previous quarters revenue of $366.2 million and increased $152.5 million or 65% over $236.1 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.  First quarter net income of $137.2 million increased $12.7 million or 10% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $76.6 million or 126% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. The results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 were impacted by a one-time pre-tax legal cha rge of $5.3 million included in SG&A expenses which reduced earnings per share (EPS) by approximately $0.02 per share.
 
Diluted EPS of $0.59 in the first quarter increased $0.05 per share or 9% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 and increased $0.32 per share or 119% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
 
During the first quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $93.6 million to $1,052 million.  A cash dividend of $0.23 per share will be paid on November 24, 2010 to stockholders of record on November 12, 2010.  In addition, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase, depending on market conditions, up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This is the sixth consecutive quarter that the Company has grown revenues and the third consecutive quarter that the Company has achieved record quarterly revenues.  We grew revenues 6% sequentially, at the higher end of our guidance and more in-line with our historical quarterly growth patterns after a year in which quarterly revenues grew sequentially 14%, 9%, 21% and 18%. Our strategy of focusing on traditional analog end-markets (industrial, automotive and communications) has been instrumental in achieving these results.
 
Once again we had a positive book-to-bill ratio although bookings in total were less than the previous quarter. During the quarter we added more capacity and our average lead times have decreased to eight weeks from ten weeks and we continue plans to bring our lead times into our historic levels of four to six weeks.
 
As we enter the December quarter there is more uncertainty than in recent quarters which makes forecasting difficult. Although we had another positive book-to-bill ratio, bookings decreased as the quarter progressed. Customers are more confident in their ability to get parts and therefore may continue to adjust inventory levels and safety stock downward. Given the above, we currently forecast that revenue will be flat to down 4% sequentially for the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
 
This upcoming December quarter has fourteen weeks rather than the customary thirteen weeks.  The extra week will have little impact on revenues; however, operating expenses, primarily labor related costs, will increase modestly.  In addition, the Company expects to call roughly $400 million of its Convertible Senior Notes on November 1st which will reduce interest expense.
 
 Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010.

ITEM 2.02.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
On January 18, 2011, Linear Technology Corporation issued a press release titled Linear Technology reports a 50% increase in year over year quarterly revenues, guides to a reduction in the March quarter, and raises its quarterly dividend 4% to $0.24 cents per share.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS A 50% INCREASE IN YEAR OVER YEAR QUARTERLY REVENUES, GUIDES TO A REDUCTION IN THE MARCH QUARTER, AND RAISES ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND 4% TO $0.24 CENTS PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, January 18, 2011, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended January 2, 2011.  Quarterly revenues of $383.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 decreased $5.0 million or 1% from the previous quarters revenue of $388.6 million and increased $127.3 million or 50% over $256.4 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Net income of $143.7 million increased $6.5 million or 5% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $68.2 million or 90% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 benefited from a lower tax rate of 24% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 rate of 27.5% and the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 rate of 24.5%.  The Companys tax rate is lower primarily due to the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit.
 
Diluted EPS of $0.62 in the second quarter increased $0.03 per share or 5% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 and $0.29 per share or 88% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
 
During the second quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $303.6 million to $748.2 million primarily due to the cash redemption of $395.8 million (principal amount) of its 2027B Convertible Notes on November 1, 2010.  This redemption of debt did not result in any gains or losses in the statement of income.  In addition, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.23 per share to $0.24 per share.  This marks the 19 consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend.  The cash dividend of $0.24 will be paid on March 2, 2011 to stockholders of record on February 18, 2011.
th
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, As expected, the Companys revenues decreased slightly from the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 as shipments and orders began to slow following the very rapid sequential growth the Company experienced over the past several quarters.  Although revenues were down 1%, they were at the high end of our guidance and up 50% over the prior year quarter.  We retired the balance of our 2027B Convertible Notes which aids our profitability due to the reduction in net interest expense.
 
During the second quarter, customer order patterns began to respond to our lower lead times and their need for lower safety stock inventory.  Our lead times are now at their historical 4 to 6 weeks levels.  As a result, bookings declined and for the quarter we had a book-to-bill ratio of less than one.
 
Looking ahead to the March quarter, several factors impact our guidance.  Our computer business will decline as we will no longer remain in a prominent tablet computer program.  In our core business of industrial, communications infrastructure and automotive, we may temporarily under ship actual end demand as customers adjust their bookings and safety stocks to comply with our improved lead times.  Accordingly, we currently forecast that revenue and earnings will decline 6% to 10% sequentially in the March quarter.  Our core markets continue to offer strong growth opportunities for Linear and we believe we are well positioned to resume quarterly growth in these markets following the pause we are currently experiencing.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS AN INCREASE IN YEAR OVER YEAR QUARTERLY REVENUES AND NET INCOME, ALTHOUGH EACH DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, April 19, 2011, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended April 3, 2011.  Quarterly revenues of $353.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 decreased $30.4 million or 8% from the previous quarters revenue of $383.6 million and increased $41.9 million or 13% over $311.3 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.  Net income of $141.6 million decreased $2.2 million or 2% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $40.9 million or 41% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 benefited from a lower tax rate of 17% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 rate of 24% and the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 rate of 27%.  The Companys tax rate in its fiscal third quarter just ended includes a quarterly tax benefit from a settlement with the IRS related to export tax benefits taken in previous years.
 
Diluted EPS of $0.61 per share in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 decreased $0.01 per share or 2% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $0.17 per share or 39% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
 
During the third quarter the Companys cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $62.3 million to $810.5 million.  A cash dividend of $0.24 will be paid on June 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on May 20, 2011.
 
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, The quarter unfolded largely as expected with revenues declining 8%, which was the mid point of our guidance.  This decline was largely attributable to a forecasted reduction in our computer business.  Revenues from our core analog markets decreased slightly as increases in our industrial and automotive core markets were modestly offset by decreases in the communications end market.  As expected, our book-to-bill ratio, although improved from last quarter, was still less than one as in the early part of the quarter customers continued to rebalance their inventories in response to our lower lead times that are now at our historical 4 to 6 weeks level.
 
As we move into the June fourth quarter, we believe that the impact from the rebalance of inventory by our customers is behind us, and we continue to see recovery among certain of our customers in our core analog markets.  However, we do have at least near term uncertainty pertaining to the impact on our business from the tragedies caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  Geographically, the Japan market represents approximately 15% of our business and we do expect some negative impact in shipments to Japan, particularly in the automotive market that appears to be most impacted from the tragedy.  Japan is also a source of raw materials to ourselves and our competitors.  We have alternate sources for silicon wafers and most other critical materials and therefore, do not expect a supply issue for us in the near term.  However, uncertainties of supply are causing concerns at some customers.  Our low lead times and ability to supply to demand may help us in this uncertain environment.   These Japan related issues lead to uncertainties that make financial forecasting difficult.  In our case, since all of these Japanese issues could potentially offset each other, for the June quarter we are currently forecasting modest sequential revenue growth in the range of flat to up 3%.
 
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements.  In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SEQUENTIAL QUARTERLY INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME AND ACHIEVES RECORD ANNUAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.48 BILLION AND $2.50, RESPECTIVELY.
Milpitas, California, July 26, 2011, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended July 3, 2011. Quarterly revenues of
$358.6 million
for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased $5.4 million or 1.5% over the previous quarter's revenue of
$353.2 million
and decreased $7.6 million or 2% from
$366.2 million
reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income of
$158.2 million
increased $16.7 million or 12% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $33.7 million or 27% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 benefited from a lower tax rate of 9.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 rate of 17% and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 rate of 26%. The Company's tax rate in its fiscal third and fourth quarters just ended includes a quarterly tax benefit from a settlement with the IRS related to its audit of prior fiscal years.
Diluted earnings per share of
$0.68
per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased $0.07 per share or 11% over the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 and increased $0.14 per share or 26% over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Revenue for fiscal year 2011 was $1.48 billion, an increase of 27% or $314 million over revenue of $1.17 billion for the previous fiscal year. Net income of $580.8 million for fiscal year 2011 increased $219.4 million or 61% over $361.3 million reported in the previous fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2011 was $2.50, an increase of 58% or $0.92 per share over the prior fiscal year.
During the fourth quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $112 million to $922.5 million. A cash dividend of $0.24 will be paid on August 31, 2011 to stockholders of record on August 19, 2011.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We met the midpoint of our revenue guidance for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2011, as sales grew 1.5% compared to the preceding third quarter. We are pleased with our annual results as the Company achieved record annual revenues and earnings per share while maintaining industry leading profitability. However, in the short-term we experienced declining bookings demand towards the end of the quarter. We had anticipated that the Japan tragedies and the related supply disruptions would continue to impact our customers, particularly in the automotive and industrial markets. Now that these industry-wide supply issues have been largely resolved customers have been reducing their inventories more than anticipated. The impact of these events and general economic sluggishness relating to US and European debt issues appear to have left customers cautious and delaying orders and shipments until the current economic picture becomes clearer. On a positive note, end-demand expectations at our customers appears generally unchanged and automotive production is expected to pick-up in the fall.
We continue to be optimistic about our long-term growth prospects as our business is healthy and we are encouraged by the high level of interest in our products that indicate they are well targeted to meet the needs of our customers and their demand for innovative high performance analog solutions. Although forecasting is difficult in the current environment, we agree with recent industry analysis that suggests that demand should accelerate as we proceed toward the end of the calendar year. However, in the short-term we are cautious and anticipate some headwinds as we react to declining orders that have not improved meaningfully in the first month of our new fiscal year. As a result, we currently are forecasting our revenues to decline sequentially 6%-8% in our first fiscal quarter of 2012.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2010.
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, July 27, 2011 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME
(In thousands, except per share amounts)

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and the non-cash charge on early retirement of convertible senior notes.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation and non-cash interest expenses and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant non-cash expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME.
Milpitas, California, October 18, 2011, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended October 2, 2011. Quarterly revenues of
$329.9 million
for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 decreased $28.6 million or 8% from the previous quarter's revenue of
$358.6 million
and decreased $58.7 million or 15% from
$388.6 million
reported in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. Net income of
$108.4 million
decreased $49.8 million or 32% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and decreased $28.8 million or 21% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 benefited from a lower tax rate of 9.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 rate of 26.25%. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.47
per share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 decreased $0.21 per share or 31% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and declined $0.12 per share or 20% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2011.
During the first quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $45.1 million to $967.7 million, net of spending $25.2 million to purchase 884,600 shares of its common stock in the open market. A cash dividend of $0.24 per share will be paid on November 30, 2011 to stockholders of record on November 18, 2011.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, Revenue declined 8% in our first fiscal quarter compared to the preceding fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, in line with our guidance. In the beginning of the quarter, we noted that orders had slowed and that global economic sluggishness appeared to affect the ordering patterns of our customers as they continued to work down inventories. Although cautious given the current economic state, we were hopeful that this would be temporary and that orders would pick up in the latter half of the quarter as inventories and orders were balanced against end customer demand. This did occur in a few of our markets, notably the automotive market as the efforts we have invested in that business are having positive results. However, business in our core industrial and communications end-markets continued to soften through the quarter as it appears that end-demand has softened. Consequently, we are cautious and we expect many of our customers, particularly in the industrial and communications end-markets to have year-end shutdowns and thereby delay inventory procurement into the new year. Accordingly, we expect another difficult quarter of declining revenues and earnings, with revenues down 9%-13% sequentially in the second quarter. As is our custom during these difficult business cycles, the Company will take the necessary measures to curtail spending and limit the impact of lower revenues on profitability. We expect operating income as a percentage of sales to be in the mid to low-forty percent range depending on sales. As we have demonstrated in other periods of economic uncertainty at these levels we expect to maintain industry leading profitability.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2011.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY AND YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME, BUT GUIDES TO GROWTH IN THE MARCH QUARTER AND RAISES ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND 4% TO $0.25 PER SHARE.
Milpitas, California, January 17, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended January 1, 2012. Quarterly revenues of
$294.3 million
for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 decreased $35.6 million or 11% from the previous quarter's revenue of
$329.9 million
and decreased $89.3 million or 23% from
$383.6 million
reported in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Net income of
$87.9 million
decreased $20.5 million or 19% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and decreased $55.9 million or 39% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.38
per share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 decreased $0.09 per share or 19% from the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and declined $0.24 per share or 39% from the second quarter of fiscal year 2011.
During the second quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $69.8 million to $1.038 billion, net of spending
$24.8 million
to acquire Dust Networks. Acquisition costs in the second quarter pertaining to Dust Networks were $3.2 million or $0.01 per share. In addition, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.25 per share. This marks the 20th consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. At the current stock price the Company's dividend yield is approximately 3%. The cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on February 29, 2012 to stockholders of record on February 17, 2012.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was an encouraging quarter in a difficult global economic environment.  We met the mid point of our guidance and we believe that we are at an inflection point in our business.  Bookings, which started slowly, strengthened in December and continued strengthening in January.  In these challenging times we maintained strong profitability, reporting operating margins at 45% of sales.  Given the improvement in our bookings and our current outlook for the March quarter, we are estimating that we will grow quarterly revenues sequentially in the 4% to 8% range for our fiscal third quarter.  As we announced earlier, we have acquired Dust Networks, a leading provider of wireless sensor networks.  Although Dust will initially have minimal impact on our quarterly financial results, we are optimistic about growth prospects for Dust in its emerging markets and the synergies between Dust and Linear in bringing rugged, low power, wireless solutions to the industrial and other end-markets.

EXHIBIT INDEX

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME AND GUIDES FOR GROWTH IN THE JUNE QUARTER.
Milpitas, California, April 17, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended
April 1, 2012
. Quarterly revenues of
$312.4 million
for the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2012 increased
$18.0 million
or
6.1%
over the previous quarter's revenue of
$294.3 million
and decreased
$40.8 million
or
11.6%
from
$353.2 million
reported in the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2011. Net income of
$98.5 million
increased
$10.6 million
or
12%
over the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and decreased
$43.1 million
or
30%
from the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2011 which benefited from a lower tax rate. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.42
per share in the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2012 increased
$0.04
per share or
11%
over the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and declined
$0.19
per share or
31%
from the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2011.
During the third quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $74.3 million to $1.1 billion. A cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on May 30, 2012 to stockholders of record on May 18, 2012.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, This was a transitional quarter for us as we returned to growth in revenue and profit. Our bookings, which began to improve at the end of last quarter, continued strong throughout the March quarter and we had a positive book to bill ratio. Consequently, we grew revenues by 6% in-line with the mid-point of our guidance. We experienced improvements in each of our major end-markets led by industrial and automotive. Our operating margin of 45% was similar to last quarter. Our third quarter results include Dust Networks, which we acquired in late December 2011. While revenues from Dust in the quarter were not significant, Dust's operating expenses included in our consolidated results had a minor negative impact on operating margins and net income.
Given the improvement in our bookings and the broad distribution of this strength across all our major end-markets, we are estimating that we will again grow quarterly revenues sequentially in the 4% to 8% range in our fourth fiscal quarter. We also expect operating income and operating margin to improve.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2011.
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, April 18, 2012 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (913) 312-0958, or toll free (888) 778-8904 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation, the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense and the non-cash charge on early retirement of convertible senior notes. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP measures exclude the special expense items related to the acquisition.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expenses, acquisition related costs and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant special expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY CLOSES OUT FISCAL YEAR 2012 WITH SEQUENTIAL QUARTERLY INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME, WHEREAS FISCAL YEAR 2012 REVENUES AND NET INCOME DECREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.
Milpitas, California, July 24, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ-LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended
July 1, 2012
. Quarterly revenues of
$330.0 million
for the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2012
increased $17.7 million or 5.7% over the previous quarter's revenue of
$312.4 million
and decreased $28.5 million or 8.0% from
$358.6 million
reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2011
. Net income of
$103.3 million
increased $4.8 million or 4.9% over the third quarter of fiscal year
2012
and decreased $54.9 million or 34.7% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2011
. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 benefited from a lower tax rate of 9.5% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2012
rate of 26.5%. The Company's tax rate in the prior year quarter included a quarterly tax benefit from a settlement with the IRS related to its audit of prior fiscal years. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.44
per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2012
increased $0.02 per share or 5% over the third quarter of fiscal year
2012
and decreased $0.24 per share or 35% from the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2011
.
Revenue for fiscal year
2012
was
$1.27 billion
, a decrease of
14.6%
or
$217.3 million
from revenue of
$1.48 billion
for the previous fiscal year. Net income of
$398.1 million
for fiscal year
2012
decreased
$182.7 million
or
31.5%
from
$580.8 million
reported in the previous fiscal year. Fiscal year 2012 results were impacted by a $3.2 million charge related to acquisition costs for Dust Networks while the previous fiscal year benefited from a $4.2 million gain related to various legal settlements and from a lower tax rate of 19.8% compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2012. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal year
2012
was
$1.70
, a decrease of
32%
or
$0.80
per share from the prior fiscal year.
During the fourth quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $91.2 million to $1.2 billion. A cash dividend of $0.25 will be paid on August 29, 2012 to stockholders of record on August 17, 2012.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, Our fourth quarter financial results were in the mid range of our guidance as sales grew 6% compared to the preceding third quarter and both gross margin and operating margin improved as a percent of sales.  This was also our fiscal year-end.  In a challenging global economic environment we improved as the year progressed growing sequentially 6% in each of the last two quarters.  Automotive was our best performing end-market, growing bookings 24% year over year.  Our largest end-market is industrial, which was 40% of our business.  Over the last three years industrial and automotive have been the fastest growing analog end-markets and we have grown these end-markets at a faster rate than the industry overall.
As we turn our focus to fiscal 2013, general economic sluggishness remains in the U.S. and we are particularly cautious about the European market and its sovereign debt issues.  Historically, the first fiscal quarter is a seasonally weak period in that region and this could be exacerbated by the continuing debt crisis.  We are hopeful that the strength we are seeing in Japan and Asia will continue to offset weakness in Europe and flatness in the USA.  Given the current environment and the level of bookings we have received over the past quarter, we are currently forecasting our revenues to be flat to up 3% over our just completed fourth fiscal quarter, generally in line with our historical seasonality for summer quarters.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2012.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS QUARTERLY MODEST INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME.
Milpitas, California, October 16, 2012, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the quarter ended
September 30, 2012
. Quarterly revenues of
$335.1 million
for the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2013 increased $5.1 million or 1.6% over the previous quarter's revenue of
$330.0 million
and increased
$5.2 million
or
1.6%
over
$329.9 million
reported in the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2012. Net income of
$105.2 million
increased
$1.9 million
or
2%
over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and decreased
$3.2 million
or
3%
from the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2012. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.45
per share in the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2013 increased
$0.01
per share or
2%
over the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and declined
$0.02
per share or
4%
from the
first
quarter of fiscal year 2012.
During the first quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by
$116.9 million
to
$1.3 billion
. A cash dividend of $0.25 per share will be paid on November 28, 2012 to stockholders of record on November 16, 2012. The Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase, depending on market conditions, up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market over the next two years.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We met the midpoint of our revenue guidance for our first fiscal quarter of 2013, as sales grew 1.6% compared to the preceding fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. In addition, net income improved and operating income as a percent of sales improved to 46.3%. Though we are pleased with these results, external global market conditions have continued to weaken. While the automotive market continues to show strength on higher bookings, this increase was offset by lower bookings in our other major markets, particularly the industrial and computer markets. Forecasting continues to be difficult in the current environment. Though customer inventory levels appear to be at reasonable levels, demand continues to be sluggish and orders have not shown signs of improvement as we begin the second quarter. Given this weakness, we expect that this will be a difficult quarter as we remain cautious about the economy and the global market. As a result, we currently are forecasting our revenues to decline sequentially in the 5% - 10% range in our second fiscal quarter of 2013.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2012.
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, October 17, 2012 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call (913) 312-1443, or toll free (888) 737-3705 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SEQUENTIAL QUARTERLY DECLINES, BUT MODEST YEAR OVER YEAR QUARTERLY INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME AND GUIDES FOR SEQUENTIAL QUARTERLY IMPROVEMENT.
Milpitas, California, January 15, 2013, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended
December 30, 2012
. Quarterly revenues of
$305.3 million
for the
second
quarter of fiscal year 2013 decreased $29.9 million or 8.9% from the previous quarter's revenue of $335.1 million and increased
$10.9 million
or
3.7%
over
$294.3 million
reported in the
second
quarter of fiscal year 2012. Net income of
$88.8 million
decreased
$16.3 million
or 15.5% from the
first
quarter of
fiscal year 2013
and increased
$0.9 million
or
1%
over the
second
quarter of
fiscal year 2012
. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.38
per share in the
second
quarter of
fiscal year 2013
decreased
$0.07
per share or
16%
from the
first
quarter of
fiscal year 2013
and was flat compared to the
second
quarter of
fiscal year 2012
.
During the second quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $20.6 million to $1.299 billion from the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased primarily due to the Company accelerating the payment of its March quarterly dividend payment into the December quarter to benefit shareholders due to fiscal cliff tax rate uncertainties. Concurrent with the December payout, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's quarterly dividend from $0.25 per share to $0.26 per share. This marked the 21st consecutive year the Company has increased its dividend. At the current stock price the Company's dividend yield is approximately 3%.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, As we reported at this time last quarter, we expected a difficult second fiscal quarter given the tough economic climate existing domestically and globally. Revenue declined 9% compared to the preceding quarter. This was within our guidance, though at the low end, as bookings continued to be weak throughout the first two months of the quarter. Though we were disappointed in the revenue decline, we are encouraged that we saw stronger bookings momentum exiting the quarter and this improvement has continued through the early stage of the current quarter. Innovation is prevalent in our end markets and our product positioning is strong. Based upon our current bookings rate, and assuming business confidence improves, we expect to resume moderate revenue growth. We currently estimate that fiscal third quarter revenues will grow in the range of 1% to 4% over the second quarter.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2012.
Company officials will be discussing these results in greater detail in a conference call tomorrow, Wednesday, January 16, 2013 at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Coast Time. Those investors wishing to listen in may call 719-325-4833, or toll free 877-741-4249 before 8:15 a.m. to be included in the audience.

Amortization of debt discount is non-cash interest expense related to the Companys Convertible Senior Notes.
The Companys non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and the amortization of the Companys debt discount which is a non-cash interest expense. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP measures exclude the special expense items related to the acquisition.  The Companys management uses non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to evaluate the Companys current operating results and financial results and to compare them against historical financial results.  The Company excludes stock-based compensation, non-cash interest expenses, acquisition related costs and the related tax effects primarily because they are significant special expense estimates, which management separates for consideration when evaluating and managing business operations. In addition management believes it is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the Company and provides further clarity on its profitability.
In addition, the Company believes that providing investors with these non-GAAP measurements enhances their ability to compare the Companys business against that of its many competitors who employ and disclose similar non-GAAP measures.  This financial measure may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by the Companys competitors to the extent their non-GAAP measures include other items.  The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for net income or net income per diluted share prepared in accordance with GAAP.

LINEAR TECHNOLOGY REPORTS SEQUENTIAL AND YEAR OVER YEAR QUARTERLY INCREASES IN REVENUES AND NET INCOME.
Milpitas, California, April 16, 2013, Linear Technology Corporation (NASDAQ:LLTC), a leading, independent manufacturer of high performance linear integrated circuits, today reported financial results for the fiscal quarter ended
March 31, 2013
. Quarterly revenues of
$314.5 million
for the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2013 increased
$9.3 million
or
3%
over the previous quarter's revenue of
$305.3 million
and increased
$2.2 million
or
1%
over
$312.4 million
reported in the
third
quarter of fiscal year 2012. Net income of
$111.0 million
increased
$22.1 million
or
25%
over the
second
quarter of
fiscal year 2013
and increased
$12.5 million
or
13%
over the
third
quarter of
fiscal year 2012
. The current year fiscal quarter benefited from a lower tax rate of 12.75% as compared to 27% in the previous period and 23.75% in the prior year quarter. The Company's tax rate is lower primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit and secondarily due to the release of estimated tax liabilities for fiscal years that are no longer subject to audit. Diluted earnings per share of
$0.46
per share in the
third
quarter of
fiscal year 2013
increased
$0.08
per share or
18%
over the
second
quarter of
fiscal year 2013
and increased $0.04 per share or 10% over the
third
quarter of
fiscal year 2012
.
During the third quarter the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $155.1 million over the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 to $1.455 billion net of spending $24.2 million to purchase approximately 640,000 shares of its common stock in the open market. A cash dividend of $0.26 per share will be paid on May 29, 2013 to stockholders of record on May 17, 2013.
According to Lothar Maier, CEO, We are pleased to report a solid quarter with sequential growth at the higher end of our guidance. We grew quarterly revenues 3% sequentially, had a positive book-to-bill ratio and improved our gross margin and operating margin as we continue to control spending where practical. The two end-markets most favorably impacted by the improved bookings were the automotive and industrial end-markets. Looking forward, customers generally acknowledge growth, but continue to order cautiously to the low-end of published lead times. As a result, we are currently estimating revenue growth in the same range we guided last quarter, 1% to 4% for our fiscal fourth quarter.
Except for historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking statements. In particular, the statements regarding the demand for our products, our customers' ordering patterns and the anticipated trends in our sales and profits are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties, including such factors, among others, as the timing, volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped, the timely introduction of new processes and products, general and country specific conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described in our 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
