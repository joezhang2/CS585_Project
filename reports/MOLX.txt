EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS 2003 FISCAL THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Lisle, IL, USA - April 16, 2003 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal third quarter and first nine months ended March 31, 2003 and provided guidance for the fourth quarter ending June 30, 2003. 3rd Quarter and Nine Month Results - ---------------------------------- Revenues of $443.2 million increased 8.5 percent from last year's third quarter of $408.3 million. Revenues in local currencies increased 2.3 percent, as currency translation increased net revenues by $25.5 million compared with last year's third quarter. Net income was $24.8 million, compared with last year's third quarter of $19.7 million. Net return on sales was 5.6 percent, compared with 4.8 percent in the same quarter last year. Earnings per share of $0.13 increased 30 percent compared with the $0.10 reported in the same quarter last year. Currency translation did not have a material effect upon net income, as the major portion of the translation gain occurred in regions currently reporting lower than normal local currency profitability. Although both revenues and net income increased over the prior year's third quarter, these results were below the guidance previously provided for the March quarter. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "It is clear that the modest recovery in the worldwide markets that Molex serves, which began approximately one year ago, has lost momentum, and in fact, took a step backward during the second half of the month of March. We attribute the latter to the current high level of global uncertainty, which magnified the existing caution shown by our customers. On the positive side, we believe we continued to gain market share during the quarter and achieved reasonable, although somewhat disappointing financial results."
"Looking at our regional results compared to last year's fiscal third quarter, in the Americas, revenues increased 0.9 percent as demand remains difficult in the fiber optics, telecom, and corporate infrastructure related markets. In the Far East South, revenues increased 23.5 percent in dollars and 21.7 percent in local currency. In this region we continue to gain market share, based on our many new products and increased penetration with our global customers who continue to transfer manufacturing to the region. In the Far East North (Japan and Korea), revenues increased 26.6 percent in dollars and 12.7 percent in local currency, primarily driven by our new products. In Europe, revenues in local currency declined by 16.5 percent, reflecting Europe's stagnant telecom business and manufacturing transfers by customers primarily to China, as well as Europe lagging behind the other regions in the economic cycle. Revenues in dollars increased by 2.5 percent, as the region was helped by currency translation due to the gain in the Euro. We believe that the outlook in Europe remains challenging and do not expect a recovery in Europe during our current fiscal year." King continued, "Gross profit margin of 33.5 percent was higher than the prior year's third quarter of 32.4 percent. Gross profit margin also improved from the December prior quarter, despite the lower level of sales. This was primarily due to lower raw material cost on a more favorable mix of product sales. Looking forward, we believe gross profit margins will remain highly correlated to sales levels. Our balance sheet remains strong with the Company effectively managing its cash flow. Our quarter ending cash balance increased sequentially by $7.0 million to $334.0 million." The Company's backlog on March 31, 2003 stood at $188.7 million, compared with $203.6 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the backlog would have been $175.6 million. Orders for the March quarter increased 9.8 percent when compared to last year's third quarter. The Company includes in reported backlog only those items having both a purchase order and a scheduled delivery date. However, industry practices are increasingly moving toward indication orders, where customers initially provide a forecast as opposed to a purchase order. In those cases, the recording of the order in the Company's backlog is delayed until the customer requests shipment, at which time the order is also removed from backlog. As transactions under this practice are not included in the period ending backlog, the Company advises caution in relying on the backlog as a single leading indicator. It is estimated that currently 17 percent of the Company's total orders are processed under this practice, up from 8 percent in calendar 1999. The Company anticipates that this industry trend will continue. Revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 2003 were $1.37 billion, compared with $1.26 billion in the prior fiscal year period, a 8.9 percent increase. Net income was $83.0 million compared with last year's $49.1 million. Net income of $83.0 million increased 22.2 percent when compared with last year's proforma net income of $67.9 million which excludes the $25.3 million special charge and one-time positive tax adjustments of $6.4 million. Earnings per share were $0.43 compared with $0.25 reported for the prior fiscal year. On a proforma basis, earnings per share for the prior fiscal year were $0.35, which excludes the special charge of $0.13 offset by the one-time positive tax adjustments of $0.03. For the nine-month period, currency translation increased net revenues by $44.4 million and increased net income by $1.5 million. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ---------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the third quarter were $29.8 million, a 9.1 percent increase when compared with $27.3 million for the same period last year. R&D expenditures for the nine-month period were $89.1 million, versus $83.3 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $47.9 million, versus $38.0 million for the same period last year. Approximately $2.7 million of this increase was due to foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures for the nine-month period were $127.6 million, versus $127.0 million for the same period last year. This is consistent with the Company's plan to increase spending on assets directly related to new products or productivity improvements, while lowering spending on general manufacturing assets. Fiscal 4th Quarter Outlook - -------------------------- The Company also provided guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003. The global economy continues to be challenging, particularly in Europe, and there is no clear outlook as to when business levels will recover from the March downturn. Most of our customers continue to order only for their short-term requirements, providing little advance notice. We are also more cautious at the current time regarding the magnitude and benefit of the seasonal patterns that normally result in a relatively stronger June quarter. On the positive side, we are encouraged that inventory in the majority of our sales channels is at reasonable levels. Based on these facts, the Company expects that revenues for the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003, will be in a range of $450 to $460 million. Based on these revenues, the Company expects that earnings per share will be approximately $0.14. The Company anticipates, providing initial guidance for its next fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, in its earnings announcement for the quarter ending June 30, 2003, which is scheduled for release on July 23, 2003.
Stock Buyback Actions - --------------------- During the quarter, the Company repurchased 810,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $15.0 million. For the nine months ended March 31, 2003, the Company has repurchased 2,677,500 shares for a total of $60.0 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2003.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX TO TAKE 2003 FOURTH QUARTER RESTRUCTURING CHARGE; UPDATES PREVIOUS REVENUE AND EPS GUIDANCE FOR 2003 FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER Lisle, IL, USA - May 29, 2003 - Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronics components company, today announced it intends to record a pretax charge, in its fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30, 2003, of approximately $38 to $40 million, primarily related to the restructuring of its operations for the telecom infrastructure market. Restructuring Actions - --------------------- As a result of continuing weak demand in the telecom infrastructure market, the Company will downsize two facilities in the United States, and write-off manufacturing assets as well as licenses and investments, all of which are dedicated to certain of its fiber optic components, primarily for the telecom industry. The Company will also close two smaller facilities located in the European Region that also supply products for the telecom infrastructure market. As part of these actions, the Company will reduce headcount by approximately 550 full and part time employees. The approximate amount of the pretax charge for all actions mentioned above is $38 to $40 million. Of this amount, approximately $19 million relates to facility and manufacturing assets, $6 million to licenses and investments, and $14 million to staffing reductions. The amount of the net after tax charge for all actions is estimated to be approximately $28 to $30 million. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "It is clear that the high end segment of the telecom market, especially in applications using optical products, will remain at disappointing levels longer that we had anticipated. The actions announced today are a necessary step to further adjust our cost structure and manufacturing presence, and support our initiatives and help us in our overall efforts to get back to our traditional profit goal." Comments on 2003 Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year - ----------------------------------------------- The Company now expects that revenues for the fourth quarter ending June 30, 2003, will be at the higher end of its previous guidance range of $450 to $460 million. Earnings per share after the charge are expected to be approximately $0.01 for the quarter ending June 30, 2003. Prior to the charge, earnings per share are now expected to be $0.15 to $0.16 as compared to the previous guidance of $0.14. The increase is primarily due to the elimination of previously planned bonus payments for employees at the corporate office, as well as at most operations. These actions are being taken in response to the charge mentioned in this release, as well as results that are below our budget for the fiscal year. Based on these results for the June quarter, the Company now expects revenues of $1,825 to $1,830 billion for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, and earnings per share after the charge of approximately $0.44. Earnings per share prior to the charge are expected to be $0.58 to $0.59 for the full fiscal year. Questions Regarding the Restructuring and Charge - ------------------------------------------------ Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Neil Lefort, Vice President, Investor Relations, will be available to answer questions regarding the charge at 7:30 a.m. CST on Friday, May 30, 2003. Please dial (800) 603-3143 to access the call. A 24-hour replay will also be available by dialing (800) 642-1687 / Conference ID 994963.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS 2003 FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR-END RESULTS INCLUDING PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING CHARGE;PROVIDES OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2004 Lisle, IL, USA - July 23, 2003 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 and provided initial guidance for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Restructuring Actions - --------------------- On May 29, 2003, the Company announced its intention to record a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $38 to $40 million in its fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2003. The charge primarily related to the company's active fiber optic operations for the telecom infrastructure market. Included in the fourth quarter and fiscal year results, is the actual pretax restructuring charge of $40.1 million, or $28.6 million net after tax. It is estimated that the elimination of costs associated with these operations should result in a positive addition to FY04 earnings per share of approximately $0.05. Fourth Quarter Results - ---------------------- Revenues of $476.1 million increased 4.3 percent from last year's fourth quarter of $456.3 million. Revenues in local currencies declined 0.8 percent; however, currency translation increased net revenues by $23.4 million compared with last year's fourth quarter. Results for the fourth quarter included an after tax restructuring charge of $28.6 million. Net income was $2.0 million and earnings per share were $0.01. Currency translation did not have a corresponding favorable impact on net income, as the major portion of the revenue translation occurred in Europe where current profitability is low. Fourth Quarter Results Prior to Restructuring Charge - ---------------------------------------------------- Pro-forma net income prior to the restructuring charge was $30.5 million, compared with last year's fourth quarter net income of $27.3 million. Net return on sales was 6.4 percent, compared with 6.0 percent in the same quarter last year. Earnings per share were $0.16, an increase of 14.3 percent compared with the $0.14 reported in the same quarter last year. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "While local currency sales were basically flat versus last year's fourth quarter, local currency net income from operations increased 10.4 percent, primarily due to the Company's aggressive cost reduction programs. Business in the Far East improved during the quarter, and while our customers in the U.S. remain cautious, we believe the tone of business is gradually becoming more positive." Looking at our regional results compared to last year's fiscal fourth quarter, in the Americas, revenues declined 6.2 percent as demand remains challenging in the fiber optics, telecom, and corporate infrastructure related markets. In the Far East South, revenues increased 19.6 percent in dollars and 18.7 percent in local currency. In this region we continue to build upon our advantage as the largest supplier, by introducing many new products for our global customers who continue to transfer manufacturing to the region. In the Far East North (Japan and Korea), revenues increased 13.0 percent in dollars and 5.7 percent in local currencies, primarily driven by our leadership position in the exciting digital electronics market. In Europe, revenues in local currency declined by 11.6 percent, reflecting the impact of customers continuing to transfer production to the Far East, as well as the difficult conditions in many of Europe's larger economies. Revenues in dollars increased by 9.0 percent, as the region was helped by currency translation due to the gain in the Euro. King continued, "Gross profit margin prior to the charge was 33.7 percent, an increase when compared with the prior year's fourth quarter gross margin of 32.2 percent. Gross profit margin prior to the charge also improved modestly from the March prior quarter. Looking forward, we believe gross profit margins will remain highly correlated to sales levels. Our balance sheet remains strong with the Company effectively managing its cash flow. Our quarter ending cash balance increased sequentially by $16.2 million to $350.2 million." Backlog - -------- The Company's backlog on June 30, 2003 stood at $185.6 million, compared with $203.5 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the backlog would have been $178.5 million. Orders for the June quarter increased 3.9 percent compared with last year's fourth quarter. The Company includes in reported backlog only those items having both a purchase order and a scheduled delivery date. However, industry practice is increasingly moving toward indication orders, where customers initially provide a forecast as opposed to a purchase order. In those cases, the recording of the order in the Company's backlog is delayed until the customer requests shipment, at which time the order is also removed from backlog. As transactions under this practice are not included in the ending backlog, the Company advises caution in relying on the backlog as a single leading indicator. The Company anticipates that this industry trend will continue. Full Fiscal Year Results - ------------------------ Revenues for the year ended June 30, 2003 were $1.843 billion, compared with $1.711 billion in the prior fiscal year period, a 7.7 percent increase. Revenue in local currencies increased 3.7 percent, as currency translation increased revenue by $67.8 million compared with the prior fiscal year period. Restructuring charges net of tax included in the results for the year ended June 30, 2003 were $28.6 million, and were $20.3 million in the year ended June 30, 2002. Net income was $84.9 million compared with last year's $76.5 million. Earnings per share were $0.44 compared with last year's $0.39. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, currency translation increased net income by $2.1 million. Full Fiscal Year Results Prior to Restructuring Charges - ------------------------------------------------------- Prior to the charges, pro-forma net income for the year ended June 30, 2003 was $113.4 million compared with last year's pro-forma net income of $96.8 million. Earnings per share were $0.59 compared with $0.49 reported for the prior fiscal year. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ----------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the fourth quarter were $27.9 million, a 2.0 percent decrease when compared with $28.5 million for the same period last year. R&D expenditures for the full fiscal year were $117.0 million, versus $111.8 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $43.5 million, versus $45.5 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the full fiscal year were $171.2 million, versus $172.5 million for the same period last year. September Quarter and FY04 Outlook - ---------------------------------- The global economy continues to be challenging, particularly in Europe. The Company expects that its strength in the Far East will continue to drive performance, and that a modest improvement in the overall markets it serves should begin during the remainder of calendar 2003. While visibility remains difficult, recent estimates indicate that inventory within the supply chain, especially in the OEM and distribution channels, is now at somewhat lower than normal levels. As a result, should demand improve, the Company would anticipate a fairly quick impact on revenue. Based on these conditions, the Company expects that revenues for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2003, traditionally the Company's slowest quarter, will be in a range of $470 to $480 million. Based on these revenues, the Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.15 - $0.16. The Company expects for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, revenues in a range of $1.975 - $2.050 billion, an increase of 7 - 11 percent versus FY03. Net income is expected to grow faster than revenues, due to leverage from the higher volume and the cost reductions implemented during fiscal FY03. Earnings per share are estimated to be in a range of $0.72 - $0.82, which includes a positive effect of approximately $0.05 due to the restructuring charge announced on May 29, 2003. The Company expects capital spending in FY04 to be modestly lower than FY03, in a range of $160 to $170 million. Capital spending will be primarily focused on assets directly related to revenue, or to the expansion of capabilities in lower cost locations. Capacity utilization of indirect or generic manufacturing assets is currently below normal levels, and as a result, the Company will continue to control spending in these areas. The Company will provide additional commentary on its operations at its annual analysts meeting tomorrow July 24, 2003. Please see note below. Stock Buyback Actions - --------------------- During the quarter, the Company repurchased 675,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $15.0 million. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, the Company repurchased 3,352,500 shares of MOLXA common stock for a total cost of $75.0 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2003. Note: Molex will hold an Analysts Meeting on Thursday, July 24, 2003. The location is the Wyndham Northwest Chicago, 400 Park Boulevard, Itasca, Illinois. The meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m. and end at 3:30 p.m. CDT.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS 2004 FISCAL FIRST QUARTER RESULTS Lisle, IL, USA -- October 15, 2003 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003. Fiscal 1st Quarter Results - --------------------------- Revenues of $496.8 million increased 6 percent from last year's first quarter of $469.2 million. Revenues in local currencies increased 4 percent, as currency translation increased net revenues by $10.3 million when compared with last year's first quarter. Net income was $32.1 million compared with last year's first quarter of $30.0 million, an increase of 7 percent. While currency translation had a positive effect on revenue, it had a negative impact on net income. Earnings per share were $0.17 compared with $0.15 reported for the first quarter a year ago. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenues exceeded our forecast and increased sequentially by 4 percent, a respectable result in this seasonally challenging quarter. Compared with last year's fiscal first quarter, revenues increased 6 percent, and although the revenue was helped by currency translation, we were pleased to see this growth and the improvement in earnings per share. The level of new orders during the quarter, especially in the month of September, was also very encouraging. "Looking at our regional results compared with last year's fiscal first quarter, in the Far East South region, revenues exceeded forecast and increased 25 percent in dollars, primarily driven by the digital consumer, PC, and mobile telephone markets. In this region, we are the largest supplier and continue to gain market share, based on our many new products and increased penetration of our global customers who continue to transfer production to the region. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenues increased by 14 percent in both dollars and local currencies, primarily driven by new products for the digital consumer market. In the Americas region, revenues were flat with last year. "In the European region, revenues in local currency declined 10 percent, reflecting Europe's recession and production transfers by our customers primarily to the Far East South. Revenues in dollars increased 4 percent, due to the gain in the Euro." Operating Results and Factors Impacting Profit Leverage - -------------------------------------------------------- King continued, "Gross profit margin increased slightly to 34.1 percent versus last year's first quarter, and sequentially from 33.7 percent when compared with the June quarter prior to the restructuring charge. We believe this to be a reasonable result, considering that our manufacturing plants continue to operate below optimum capacity utilization. Pretax return on sales was 8.9 percent, an increase of 11.3 percent compared with last year's first quarter. The effective tax rate was 27 percent compared with 24 percent in last year's first quarter. This increase was primarily due to a larger mix of pretax income being earned in higher tax locations. Net return on sales was 6.5 percent compared with 6.4 percent in last year's first quarter. Cash flow remains strong and our ending cash balance stood at $320.6 million." King continued, "We were pleased with our overall results and believe that global business conditions continue to improve. Although revenue and earnings per share were stronger than expected, several factors limited expansion of net return on sales for the quarter. They are: - The absence of profit leverage from the $10.3 million favorable currency translation benefit to revenue. Currency translation actually lowered net income by $0.3 million, due to the translation occurring primarily in the European region where current profitability is below average. - Costs for the transition of fiber optic manufacturing announced in the 2003 fiscal fourth quarter earnings release were somewhat higher than anticipated. - The substantial increase in demand in both Far East regions exceeded existing capacity in several new product areas. This resulted in higher manufacturing costs which should gradually decrease as planned capacity additions become available." The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2003 stood at $208.0 million, compared with $196.4 million a year ago and $185.6 million at fiscal year end 2003. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the backlog in this current quarter would have been $196.0 million - virtually flat with last year in local currencies. Bookings for the first quarter increased 9.8 percent sequentially from the June quarter, and 10.5 percent when compared with last year's first quarter. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ------------------------------------------------------------ Research and development expenditures for the first quarter were $26.9 million, compared with $30.1 million for the same period last year. This reduction was due to the adoption of a more narrow definition of research and development for FY04, resulting in a reclassification of expenditures to other expense categories, as well as lower expenditures due to exiting the active fiber business that the Company announced in the June 30, 2003 earnings release. Capital expenditures were $45.3 million for the quarter versus $38.1 million last year. Fiscal 2nd Quarter Outlook and Stock Buyback Actions - ------------------------------------------------------ King continued, "The overall level of new orders during the September quarter was encouraging, and we believe that a majority of our global markets are now in an initial phase of cautious expansion. Our operations in the Far East continue to drive our results. We believe that inventory in the majority of our worldwide sales channels remains below normal levels, and when combined with expanding demand should lead to continued improvement in our financial results." Based on these facts, the Company expects that revenues for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2003, will be in a range of $500 - $510 million. This represents an increase of 10 -12 percent over the second quarter last fiscal year. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.18 - $0.19, an increase of 20 - 26 percent over the second quarter last fiscal year. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 795,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $20 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Other items - ------------- Molex is pleased to announce the addition of Diane Bullock, who will assume the position of Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2004. Diane joins Molex, having held various global financial positions in the automotive components industry and in public accounting. Diane will assume the position following a transition period with Bob Mahoney, Molex's current Chief Financial Officer. Bob will then move to Singapore in the position of Regional President of the Far East South.

Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS STRONG 2004 FISCAL SECOND QUARTER RESULTS; EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 40%; REVENUE UP 20% Lisle, IL, USA - January 15, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2003. Second Quarter and Six Month Results - ------------------------------------ Revenues of $548.9 million increased 20.8 percent from last year's second quarter of $454.6 million. Revenues in local currencies increased 14.6 percent, as currency translation increased net revenues by $28.0 million when compared with last year's second quarter. Net income was $41.2 million compared with last year's second quarter of $28.2 million, an increase of 46.3 percent. Currency translation increased net income by $1.0 million. Earnings per share of $0.21 increased 40.0 percent compared with $0.15 reported for the second quarter a year ago. Revenue in the Far East South increased 34 percent in dollars and 32 percent in local currency, primarily driven by the digital consumer, PC, and mobile phone markets. Revenue in the Far East North (Japan and Korea) increased by 30 percent in dollars and by 18 percent in local currencies. This growth was driven by our new products, especially for the digital, mobile and personal electronics markets including flat panel displays, DVD recorders, digital still cameras and mobile phones. Revenues were also strong in the industrial market, where the Company further expanded market share, especially for semiconductor inspection equipment. In the Americas, revenue increased 6 percent from last year, the strongest result in several years, based on a broad improvement in end markets. In Europe, revenue in local currency increased 3 percent while revenue in dollars increased 22 percent, helped by the strong Euro. Gross profit margin increased to 32.9 percent versus last year's second quarter margin of 32.2 percent. Pretax return on sales was 10.3 percent, versus last year's second quarter margin of 8.2 percent. The effective tax rate was 27.0 percent compared with 24.0 percent in last year's second quarter. This increase was primarily due to a larger mix of pretax income being earned in higher tax locations. Net return on sales was 7.5 percent compared with 6.2 percent in last year's second quarter. Cash flow from operations remains strong and our quarter ending cash balance stood at $327.6 million. Several factors impacted results for the quarter: - "Other income" included a $5.0 million pretax gain on a stock sale and a $5.4 million pretax positive equity adjustment, both arising from an IPO completed by a company in which Molex retains a 20 percent ownership. These were partially offset by $5.0 million in negative adjustments to exit other investments. - There was a $3.4 million pretax negative impact to cost of sales due to additional tariff costs arising from prior years, plus the conversion in Japan to mandated lead-free plating, as well as severance costs resulting from the closure of manufacturing in Puerto Rico. - There was a $2.1 million pretax negative impact to selling and administrative expense arising from the disposal of certain assets, as well as a settlement with a customer. The Company's order backlog on December 31, 2003 stood at $226.6 million, a 30.5 percent increase compared with $173.7 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the current backlog would have been $212.6 million, an increase in local currency of 22.4 percent. Bookings for the second quarter increased 9.6 percent sequentially from the first quarter, and 28.2 percent compared with last year's second quarter. Revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2003 were $1,045.7 million, compared with $923.8 million in the prior fiscal year period, a 13.2 percent increase. Net income of $73.3 million increased 26.0 percent when compared with last year's net income of $58.2 million. Earnings per share were $0.38, compared with $0.30 reported for the prior fiscal year. For the six-month period, currency translation increased net revenues by $38.4 million, but increased net income by only $0.7 million. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ---------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the second quarter were $27.5 million, compared with $29.2 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenditures for the six-month period were $54.3 million, versus $59.3 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $38.6 million, versus $41.6 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the six-month period were $83.9 million, versus $79.7 million for the same period last year. Fiscal 3rd Quarter Outlook and Stock Buyback Actions - ---------------------------------------------------- The level of new orders remains encouraging, especially in the Far East and the Americas. Although visibility remains difficult beyond the March quarter, we believe that a majority of our global markets continue to improve and that inventory in the majority of our worldwide sales channels remains below normal levels. The Company expects that revenues for the third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2004 will be in a range of $550 - $560 million. This represents an increase of 24 - 26 percent over the third quarter last fiscal year. The Company expects earnings per share to be in the range of $0.21 - $0.23, an increase of 60 - 75 percent over the third quarter last fiscal year. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 200,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $5.4 million. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, the Company has repurchased 995,000 shares for a total of $25.4 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. Purchases for the December quarter were below previous quarters in anticipation of the closing of a previously announced acquisition. The Company will continue its quarterly stock buyback program for the remainder of FY04.

Third Quarter and Nine Month Results - ------------------------------------ Revenue was $569.2 million, an increase of $126.0 million, or 28.4 percent, over the prior year quarter. Revenue in local currencies rose 22.3 percent, as currency translation increased net revenue by $27.0 million over the prior year quarter. Net income was $45.5 million for the third quarter, an increase of $20.7 million, or 83.3 percent, over the prior year quarter. Currency translation increased net income by $1.4 million. Earnings per share of $0.24 increased 84.6 percent compared with $0.13 reported for the third quarter a year ago. Revenue in the Far East South region was $151.9 million, an increase of 41 percent, primarily driven by demand from the digital consumer, PC, and mobile phone markets, serving both local and multinational customers. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $122.6 million, up 28 percent in dollars and 18 percent in local currencies, driven by demand for advanced digital home entertainment products and high end mobile phones, all with substantial connector content. Revenue also continues to improve in the industrial market, especially for semiconductor inspection equipment. In the Americas, revenue of $181.6 million rose 14 percent, the strongest increase in several years, due to a broad improvement in end markets. In Europe, revenue of $99.4 million increased 44 percent, also the strongest gain in several years. In this region, growth in local currencies was 24 percent, as foreign currency translation led by the strong Euro helped increase revenue by $14.2 million. Gross profit margin for the third quarter increased to 35.5 percent versus 33.5 percent in the prior year period, primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes. Raw material costs (primarily copper and gold) increased over the prior year quarter and the Company has recently initiated actions across its sales channels to partially recover these higher costs. Pretax return on sales for the third quarter improved significantly to 11.0 percent compared with 7.4 percent in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.0 percent, consistent with the current fiscal year-to-date tax rate, but higher when compared with 24.0 percent in the third quarter of the last fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to a larger mix of earnings in higher tax locations. Net return on sales for the third quarter increased to 8.0 percent compared with 5.6 percent in the prior year third quarter. Revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2004 was $1,614.9 million compared with $1,367.0 million in the prior fiscal year period, an 18.1 percent increase. Net income of $118.7 million rose 43.2 percent compared with last year's net income of $83.0 million. Earnings per share were $0.62 compared with $0.43 reported for the prior fiscal year. For the nine-month period, currency translation increased net revenue by $65.4 million and increased net income by $2.1 million. The Company's order backlog on March 31, 2004 stood at $263.2 million, a 39.5 percent increase compared with $188.7 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the current backlog would have been $249.3 million, an increase in local currency of 32.1 percent. The order backlog increased 16.2 percent sequentially from the second quarter. New orders for the third quarter increased 7.4 percent sequentially from the second quarter and 32.2 percent compared with last year's third quarter. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ---------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the third quarter were $29.9 million compared with $29.8 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenditures for the nine-month period were $84.2 million versus $89.1 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $50.3 million versus $47.9 million for the same period last year. Depreciation expense for the third quarter was $55.6 million versus $54.7 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the nine-month period were $134.2 million versus $127.6 million for the same period last year. The Company now anticipates capital expenditures for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, in a range of $190 - $200 million, up $30 million from initial estimates. The majority of this increase is due to expanding business levels, with $10 million due to currency translation. Fiscal 4th Quarter Outlook and Stock Buyback Actions - ---------------------------------------------------- Commenting on the June quarter outlook, Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We believe that a majority of our global markets continue to improve and that inventory in the majority of our worldwide sales channels remains at reasonable levels. We are pleased with the level of new orders we received during the March quarter, which strengthens our base going forward. Molex's financial position remains strong and a source of significant competitive advantage as our industry continues to emerge from the recession." King continued, "We expect that revenue for the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2004 will be in a range of $600 - $610 million. This represents an increase of 26 - 28 percent over the fourth quarter last fiscal year. These results include revenues of $17 million related to the recently completed Connecteurs Cinch acquisition in Europe. This acquisition will increase Molex's automotive market share in the region to 8 percent on a significantly expanded customer base. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.27 - $0.29, an increase of 70 - 80 percent over the $0.16 reported in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year prior to a restructuring charge. We anticipate providing initial comments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, in the next quarterly earnings release scheduled for July 27, 2004." See note below regarding Analysts Meeting. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 950,000 shares of MOLXA common stock at a total cost of $24.8 million. For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, the Company has repurchased 1,945,000 shares for a total cost of $50.2 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2004. The Company will continue its quarterly stock buyback program for the remainder of FY04.

EXHIBIT 99 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS RECORD REVENUE FOR 2004 FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER; REVENUE UP 33 PERCENT; EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 88 PERCENT Lisle, IL, USA - July 27, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported record revenue results for its fiscal fourth quarter, and a 22 percent revenue increase for its full fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. The Company also provided initial guidance for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. Fourth Quarter Results - ---------------------- Revenue was $631.8 million, an increase of $155.8 million, or 32.7 percent, over the prior year quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 27.7 percent, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $22.0 million over the prior year quarter. Net income was $57.2 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of $55.2 million over the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter included a $28.6 million after-tax charge for restructuring costs and investment write-off. Net income increased 87 percent compared with the prior year quarter results excluding this charge. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $.30, compared with $.01 in the prior year. Excluding last year's charge, earnings per share increased 87.5 percent compared with the prior year quarter. Currency translation increased income for the fourth quarter by $2.6 million. Revenue in the Far East South region was $176.2 million, an increase of 46 percent, primarily driven by demand from the digital consumer, PC, and mobile phone markets, serving both local and multinational customers. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $129.2 million, an increase of 20 percent in dollars and 10 percent in local currencies, driven by demand for advanced digital home entertainment products and high end mobile phones, all with substantial connector content. Revenue also continues to improve in the industrial market, especially for semiconductor inspection equipment. In the Americas, revenue of $185.5 million increased 18 percent, the strongest increase in several years, due to a broad improvement in most segments. In Europe, revenue of $125.9 million increased 60 percent, also the strongest gain in several years. In this region, the recently completed acquisition of Connecteurs Cinch added revenue of $20.5 million and foreign currency translation, led by the strong euro, helped increase revenue by $7.7 million. Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter further increased to 36.0 percent versus 32.6 percent in the prior year period, primarily due to higher manufacturing volumes. Gross profit margin also increased sequentially from the March quarter result of 35.5 percent. Pretax return on sales for the fourth quarter improved significantly to 12.2 percent compared with 8.6 percent in the prior year quarter, before last year's charge. Pretax return on sales also increased sequentially from the March quarter result of 11.0 percent. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.4 percent, as the Company adjusted the full fiscal year tax rate to 26.5 percent versus 27.0 percent recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2004. Net return on sales for the fourth quarter increased to 9.1 percent, the highest quarterly result in several years. Commenting on the fourth quarter, Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We were very pleased to achieve a new record in revenue and what we believe were gains in market share. Profitability has improved sequentially this fiscal year, with the 9.1 percent net return on sales in the fourth quarter significantly above the 6.5 percent net return in the first fiscal quarter and the 8.0 percent recorded in the most recent fiscal third quarter." Full Fiscal Year Results - ------------------------ Revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2004 was $2.247 billion compared with $1.843 billion in the prior fiscal year period, a 21.9 percent increase. Net income of $176.0 million increased $91.1 million compared with last year's net income of $84.9 million. Last year's net income included the after-tax charge of $28.6 million recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter. Net income increased $62.6 million, or 55.2 percent compared with last year's net income of $113.4 excluding this charge. Earnings per share were $0.92 compared with $0.44 reported for the prior fiscal year. The Company's order backlog on June 30, 2004 stood at $332.6 million, a 79.2 percent increase compared with $185.6 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes to currency rates, the current backlog would have been $323.8 million, an increase in local currency of 74.4 percent. The order backlog increased 26.4 percent sequentially from the third quarter. New orders for the fourth quarter of $680.3 million increased 12.2 percent sequentially from the third quarter and 45.0 percent compared with last year's fourth quarter. Included in new orders for the fourth quarter were $20.0 million due to the acquisition completed on April 2, 2004, and an estimated $25.0 million due to customers advancing orders in anticipation of an announced price increase. Without these two factors, new orders would have increased 35 percent from last year's fourth quarter and 5 percent sequentially from the third quarter. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ---------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the fourth quarter were $34.8 million compared with $27.9 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenditures for the twelve-month period were $119.0 million versus $117.0 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $55.5 million versus $43.6 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the twelve-month period were $189.7 million versus $171.2 million for the same period last year. Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was $57.6 million versus $54.3 million for the same period last year. FY05 and September Quarter Outlook - ---------------------------------- Commenting on the '05 fiscal year, Joe King, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, "We believe that the outlook in the majority of our global markets remains strong. While inventory in the supply chain has increased in recent months, this increase has occurred from historically low levels which we believe is reasonable, given the improvement in end markets. Looking forward, while demand beyond the short term remains difficult to predict, we are pleased with the level of orders in the June quarter and, certainly, the higher order backlog provides us with a tailwind heading into the new fiscal year. During fiscal year 2005, our management team will continue to focus on delivering additional profit leverage and increasing market share. Molex's financial position remains strong and is increasingly mentioned by our customers as a source of significant competitive advantage." Based on these conditions, the Company expects that revenues for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2005 will be in a range of $2,600 - $2,675 million, an increase of 16 - 19 percent over the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2004. These projections include revenue of $75 million related to the recently completed acquisition of Connecteurs Cinch. Based on these revenue expectations, net income is expected to grow faster than revenues due to leverage from the higher volume and a modestly lower level of price erosion. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.24 - $1.34, an increase of 35 - 45 percent over the $0.92 reported for fiscal year 2004. These earnings per share expectations assume a tax rate of 27.5 percent for the 2005 fiscal year compared with 26.5 percent for the 2004 fiscal year. The Company estimates capital spending in fiscal year 2005 to be in a range of $215 - $225 million, primarily directed to revenue producing assets and expansion in lower cost locations. For the current September quarter, which is traditionally the slowest due to seasonality, the Company estimates revenues in a range of $620 - - $640 million and earnings per share in a range of $.26 - $29. This would represent strong growth of 25 - 27 percent in revenues and 50 - 70 percent in earnings per share, over last year's September quarter. Stock Buyback Actions - --------------------- During the quarter, the Company repurchased 795,000 shares of MOLXA common stock at a total cost of $20.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2004, the Company has repurchased 2,740,000 shares for a total cost of $70.2 million. These purchases were completed under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2004.

EXHIBIT 99 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX MAKES STRONG START TO FISCAL 2005 YEAR; RECORD REVENUE ACHIEVED, UP 29 PERCENT; EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASE 71 PERCENT Lisle, IL, USA - October 20, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported record revenue results for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. Fiscal First Quarter Results Revenue of $640.2 million increased 29 percent from last year's first quarter of $496.8 million. Revenue in local currencies increased 25 percent, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $19 million when compared with last year's first quarter. Revenue for the first quarter included $18 million from the automotive acquisition in Europe that was completed on April 2, 2004. Excluding the acquisition, revenue increased 25 percent from last year's first quarter. Net income was $55.6 million compared with last year's first quarter of $32.1 million, an increase of 74 percent. Earnings per share of $0.29 increased 71 percent, compared with $0.17 reported for the first quarter a year ago. Joe King, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Revenue growth compared with last year's first quarter revenue was very strong. Revenue also increased sequentially, an excellent result in this seasonally challenging quarter. We believe we are growing significantly faster than the overall connector market, primarily due to our ongoing investment in new products and our global capabilities. We were also pleased with the strong growth in earnings after absorbing higher costs for many of our raw materials." Regional Results Revenue in the Far East South region was $190 million, an increase of 33 percent, primarily driven by the digital consumer, PC, and mobile communication markets. In this region, we continue to gain market share, based on our many new products and increased penetration into our global customers who continue to transfer production to the region. Revenue in the Far East North region (Japan and Korea) was $132 million, an increase of 13 percent in dollars and 6 percent in local currencies. This growth was primarily due to new products for the digital consumer and communication markets. Revenue in the Americas region was $177 million, an increase of 17 percent, due to stronger demand for high-speed, industrial and medical electronics products, which more than offset lower demand in automotive. Revenue in Europe was $128 million, an increase of 73 percent in dollars and 61 percent in local currencies. Excluding the previously mentioned automotive acquisition, revenue increased 49 percent in dollars, as the region recovers from recession. Operating Results Gross profit margin was 35.7 percent compared with last year's first quarter margin of 33.8 percent. Pretax return on sales was 12 percent compared with 8.9 percent in the year ago quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27 percent, the same rate as last year's first quarter. The Company now anticipates an effective tax rate of 27 percent for the 2005 fiscal year, compared with previous guidance of 27.5 percent and a 2004 fiscal year rate of 26.5 percent. Net return on sales was 8.7 percent compared with 6.5 percent in last year's first quarter. Cash and marketable securities were $331.4 million at September 30, 2004. The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2004 stood at $313.6 million, a 51 percent increase compared with $208 million for the same period last year. Without the impact of changes in currency rates, the order backlog would have increased 48 percent. New orders for the first quarter were $622.4 million, an increase of 21 percent compared with last year's first quarter. This was a reasonable result, considering an estimated $25 million in orders were advanced by customers into the June quarter, as discussed in the June 30, 2004 earnings release. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending Research and development expenditures for the first quarter were $33.4 million, an increase of 24 percent when compared with the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $48.4 million for the quarter versus $45.3 million last year. Fiscal Second Quarter Outlook King continued, "Our operations in the Far East continue to drive our results. We expect this trend to continue, based on the magnitude of production transferred by our global customers to the region and supported by our technical capabilities and long term history of working in the region." "It is apparent that many of our customers in the Americas are in the process of adjusting their finished goods inventory to more conservative levels. However, we believe that the amount of actual connector inventory within these channels is reasonable, and therefore the outlook in the majority of our markets remains encouraging. In addition, we expect to gain market share based on our positions within key market segments - such as digital consumer, mobile communication and mobile computing - that are growing faster than the overall connector market, as well as our focus on the emerging medical electronics market." Based on these facts, the Company expects that revenue for the fiscal second quarter ending December 31, 2004, will be in a range of $635 - $650 million. This represents an increase of 16 - - 18 percent over last year's fiscal second quarter. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.29 - $0.31, an increase of 38 - 48 percent over last year's fiscal second quarter earnings per share. Stock Buyback Actions During the quarter, the Company purchased 875,000 shares of MOLXA common stock, at a total cost of $21.9 million. These purchases were done under a $100 million Board authorization for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. Statements in this release that are not historical are forward- looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molex's 10-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and include economic conditions in various regions, product and price competition and foreign currency exchange rate changes. Molex does not undertake to revise these forward- looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX FILES FISCAL FIRST QUARTER REPORT WITH SEC Announces Resignation of Independent Auditors Lisle, IL, USA - November 15, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, announced today that it filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier today. Molex issued a press release on November 11, 2004 disclosing that the filing of such Quarterly Report would be delayed. Molex also announced today that Deloitte & Touche LLP has resigned as the Company's independent auditors effective November 13, 2004 for the reasons described below. As a result, the unaudited financial statements for the quarter included in the 10-Q filing have not been reviewed by an independent public accounting firm under Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100 "Interim Financial Information" as is required by SEC requirements. Molex's management is not aware of any information which would result in any adjustments to the financial information included in the Form 10-Q filed today. The Quarterly Report filed today reflects the $8.0 million ($5.8 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) charge previously disclosed in Molex's November 11 press release related to the omission of certain inter-company inventory in the calculation of profit-in- inventory elimination for prior fiscal periods, of which approximately $3.0 million ($2.2 million after-tax) was related to fiscal 2004. The amount of the charge was unchanged from the amount reflected in the financial results included in Molex's October 20, 2004 earnings release. As disclosed in Molex's November 11 press release, Molex's Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and accounting advisors, conducted an inquiry. The Audit Committee inquiry is complete, and no adjustments were identified as a result of the inquiry. Also included in the results reported in the Quarterly Report for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 is a reversal of a prior year insurance accrual of $2.7 million ($2.0 million after- tax), which was no longer required, and a reduction in inventory allowance of $1.5 million ($1.1 million after-tax). These amounts are unchanged from the amounts reflected in the financial results included in Molex's October 20, 2004 earnings release. On Saturday, November 13, 2004, representatives of Deloitte advised Molex that Deloitte was prepared to complete its SAS 100 review in time to permit a filing of the Form 10-Q in substantially the form in which it was filed today by the November 15 extended deadline for such report, but only if Molex's principal executive officer and former principal financial and accounting officer, who was recently reassigned as Vice President and Treasurer as described in Molex's November 11 press release, no longer served as officers of Molex and certain disclosures relating to the matters in question were agreed upon. Molex's Audit Committee and Board of Directors each unanimously rejected this condition imposed by Deloitte. Following the communication of Molex's position, representatives of Deloitte advised Molex that Deloitte was resigning as Molex's independent auditors effective immediately. Deloitte did not advise the Company that its resignation was due to any disagreements with Molex on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused Deloitte to make reference thereto in its audit report. Fred Krehbiel, Co-Chairman of Molex, stated, "We are extremely disappointed with the timing of Deloitte's resignation and strongly disagree with their approach and the condition that we remove as officers valued members of our senior management team. My brother John and I have complete confidence in the integrity and leadership of our senior management team, and believe that the same principles of character, loyalty and integrity that built Molex's hard-earned reputation over its 66-year history are reflected in the Board's decision regarding this matter." Molex's Audit Committee has initiated contact with an independent public accounting firm, and will move promptly to engage a new accounting firm. The Audit Committee chairman, Douglas Carnahan, stated, "We are encouraged by the level of interest and expect that Molex will engage a new accounting firm shortly." Molex plans to file an amendment to its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 after the SAS 100 review of the unaudited financial statements for that quarter has been completed by new independent auditors. Until such amendment is filed, Molex is not deemed by the SEC to be current or timely in its Exchange Act filings or by Nasdaq to be in compliance with its continued listing requirements. Filing the planned amendment to the Form 10-Q after the SAS 100 review of the interim financial statements has been completed would make Molex current in its SEC filing obligations and in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirement. Statements in this release that are not historical are forward- looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molex's 10-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and include Molex's ability to timely hire a new independent registered public accounting firm, Molex's ability to timely comply with SEC and Nasdaq reporting obligations, economic conditions in various regions, product and price competition and foreign currency exchange rate changes. Molex does not undertake to revise these forward-looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise. The Company's Annual Report, as well as news releases and other supplementary financial data is available by accessing the Company's website at www.molex.com.

As disclosed in such Form 10-Q filing, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") views the Company as delinquent in its filing obligations in these circumstances. As previously disclosed, Molex plans to file an amendment to its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 promptly after the SAS 100 review of the unaudited financial statements for that quarter has been completed by new independent auditors. Filing the planned amendment to the Form 10-Q after the SAS 100 review of the interim financial statements has been completed would make Molex current in its SEC filing obligations and in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirement. On November 15, 2004, Molex received a letter from the Nasdaq staff indicating that Molex is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), which requires Molex to file with the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. copies of all reports filed or required to be filed with the SEC, and the Company's securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from The Nasdaq National Market. Nasdaq has modified and appended an "E" to the trading symbols for Molex common stock (MOLXE) and Class A common stock (MOLAE) which will remain until Molex has remedied this non- compliance. As permitted by the November 15, 2004 letter from Nasdaq and Nasdaq rules, Molex will request a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to review the determination of the Nasdaq staff described above. Molex also expects to request an extension sufficient to allow a successor independent registered public accounting firm to complete its review of the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 and for Molex to file an amended Form 10-Q for that quarter with the SEC. There can be no assurance the Panel will grant the Company's request for such an extension of time. Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. _________ ______________________________________________ On November 13, 2004, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to audit Molex's consolidated financial statements, resigned effective as of such date. The Audit Committee of Molex's Board of Directors did not recommend, nor was it asked to approve, Deloitte's resignation. As of the filing hereof on November 18, 2004, the Audit Committee had commenced the process of identifying and engaging a new independent registered public accounting firm, but has not engaged a new independent registered public accounting firm for Molex. The reports of Deloitte on Molex's consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except as described in the following sentence. The report of Deloitte on Molex's consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2004 indicated that, as described in Note 3 to such consolidated financial statements, the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2003 had been restated. There were no "reportable events" as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004, or during the subsequent interim period through November 13, 2004, except as described in the following seven paragraphs. As disclosed in Molex's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004, included in the results for the three months ended September 30, 2004 is a charge of $8.0 million ($5.8 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), of which $3.0 million ($2.2 million after-tax) related to fiscal 2004. This adjustment related to the omission of certain intercompany inventory in the Company's calculation of profit-in- inventory (PII) elimination. The Company has concluded that the amounts related to fiscal 2004 and prior years are not material, both individually and in the aggregate, to the trends of the financial statements for those periods affected, and to a fair presentation of the Company's results of operations and financial statements. Accordingly, results for fiscal 2004 and prior years have not been restated. Also included in the results for the three months ended September 30, 2004 is a reversal of a prior year insurance accrual of $2.7 million ($2.0 million after-tax), which was no longer required, and a reduction in inventory allowance of $1.5 million ($1.1 million after-tax). In mid-July, 2004, Molex's Corporate Finance Group identified an issue with the "in-transit" intercompany inventory in the calculation of profit-in-inventory elimination. On July 21, 2004, Molex's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer brought this matter to the attention of other members of senior management including Molex's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Molex management determined to further investigate including to determine how this situation occurred, an estimate of the amounts involved, and to review all inventory allowances to ensure that overall inventories were accounted for appropriately. Molex management concluded, based on the preliminary available estimates of the potential magnitude known at that time, that the amounts related to fiscal 2004 and prior years would not be material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the trends of the financial statements for those periods affected, and to a fair presentation of Molex's results of operations and financial statements. Molex subsequently issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended June 30, 2004 on July 27, 2004. On September 10, 2004, a representation letter dated August 20, 2004 was signed by Molex's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and delivered to Deloitte in connection with the audit of Molex's financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2004 and the filing of Molex's Annual Report on Form 10-K on September 10, 2004. Molex's fiscal first quarter ended on September 30, 2004. As part of the quarter-end close process, Molex reviewed the PII issue and initially recorded only a portion of the estimated adjustment attributable to prior years, as the full analysis of all inventory allowances was not complete. At a scheduled meeting on October 15, 2004, management discussed with Deloitte the nature, estimated amount and proposed accounting treatment of the PII omission as it related to prior years. During this meeting, management also discussed with Deloitte an issue which had been identified relating to the treatment of components in Molex's calculations of slow and excess inventory allowance as well as the status of the self-insurance reserve. At a meeting of the Audit Committee on October 19, 2004 to discuss the fiscal first quarter results attended by representatives of Molex and Deloitte, Molex's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and Deloitte discussed with the Audit Committee the omission with respect to PII as well as other items including the reversal of a prior year insurance accrual and the status of the Company's analysis of other inventory allowances. Molex and Deloitte agreed as to the estimated amount of the adjustment with respect to PII, but disagreed regarding Molex's proposed accounting treatment. Deloitte informed Molex that the entire estimated PII impact should be recorded in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. The Audit Committee asked management and Deloitte to work jointly to determine the appropriate accounting treatment, and after further discussions, the entire estimated PII impact was recorded in the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2004. Molex issued a press release announcing its results of operations for the fiscal first quarter on October 20, 2004. At a meeting of the Audit Committee on October 21, 2004, the resolution of the PII adjustment was discussed as well as the adjustment recorded by Molex for the reduction in inventory allowance. The Audit Committee Chairman provided reports of the October 19 and 21 meetings of the Audit Committee to the full Board of Directors on October 22, 2004. On October 21, 2004, in response to a question from Deloitte, Molex's Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer confirmed that she was aware of the potential for a PII adjustment prior to delivery of the representation letter on September 10, 2004. On October 27, 2004, Deloitte for the first time expressed to the Audit Committee that the omission with respect to PII described above should have been disclosed in the representation letter dated August 20, 2004 signed by Molex's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and delivered to Deloitte on September 10, 2004. Molex's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer did not believe that the matter was required to be addressed in that letter. Deloitte also suggested that the Audit Committee inquire as to the circumstances surrounding this matter. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and accounting advisors, conducted an inquiry into the omission and related matters. The Audit Committee concluded that it concurs with management's recommendations as to the accounting treatment for such omission and no additional adjustments were identified as a result of this inquiry. The Audit Committee also concluded that no one deliberately withheld information regarding the PII issue from Deloitte with the intent of affecting Molex's financial statements. The Audit Committee presented the findings of the inquiry to Deloitte. Deloitte requested additional information relating to this matter, including factual discrepancies regarding written materials and recollections of relevant parties. The Audit Committee made further inquiries and provided Deloitte with additional information in response to its requests. Molex filed a Form 12b-25 with the Commission on November 10, 2004 that extended the filing deadline of the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 until November 15, 2004. The Molex Board of Directors on November 10 named Robert Mahoney, an Executive Vice President and former Chief Financial Officer of Molex, as the Acting Chief Financial Officer, and reassigned the prior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer to the position of Vice President and Treasurer. The Board's action was in response to Deloitte having advised Molex that, because of its view that this matter should have been disclosed in the representation letter dated August 20, 2004 delivered to Deloitte on September 10, 2004, Deloitte would require representations and certifications from a new principal accounting and financial officer in connection with Molex's future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission containing financial statements, including the Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. Deloitte further advised Molex that it was considering whether it would require representations and certifications from a new principal executive officer in connection with Molex's future SEC filings. After further discussions among Molex, Deloitte and the Audit Committee, Deloitte advised Molex on November 13, 2004 that Deloitte was unwilling to continue to rely on the representations of Molex's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Treasurer and (former) Chief Financial Officer who had signed the representation letter dated August 20, 2004. Deloitte further advised Molex that Deloitte was willing to complete its review of Molex's unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 to be included in Molex's Form 10-Q for that fiscal quarter, but subject to a new condition. This newly-imposed condition was that Molex's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Treasurer and (former) Chief Financial Officer no longer serve as officers of Molex or in management roles where they have any significant responsibilities for the maintenance of Molex's books and records, preparation of Molex's financial statements, or are an integral part of the Company's underlying system of internal accounting controls. Molex's Audit Committee and Board of Directors each unanimously rejected this condition imposed by Deloitte. Following the communication of Molex's position, representatives of Deloitte advised Molex on November 13, 2004 that Deloitte was resigning as Molex's independent auditors effective immediately. In connection with the audits of Molex's consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2004, and during the subsequent interim period through November 13, 2004, there were no disagreements between Molex and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused Deloitte to make reference thereto in its report, except as described above and in this paragraph with respect to Deloitte's disagreement with the accounting treatment of the PII adjustment initially proposed by Molex management. Deloitte informed Molex that the entire estimated PII impact should be recorded in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. The issue was discussed with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee asked management and Deloitte to work jointly to determine the appropriate accounting treatment, and after further discussions, the entire estimated PII impact was recorded in the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, 2004 as reflected in the earnings press release issued on October 20, 2004 and in the Form 10-Q filed with the Commission on November 15, 2004. Molex has authorized Deloitte to respond fully to the inquiries of any potential successor accountant concerning the subject matter of the foregoing. Molex has requested that Deloitte furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. Molex will amend this Form 8-K and attach a copy of such letter as an exhibit promptly after Deloitte furnishes the letter to Molex. SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REQUESTS NASDAQ HEARING Lisle, IL, USA -- November 22, 2004 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, announced today that Molex has requested a hearing with the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. As previously disclosed, on November 15, 2004 Molex received a letter from the Nasdaq staff indicating that Molex is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), which requires Molex to file with the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. copies of all reports filed or required to be filed with the SEC, and the Company's securities are, therefore, subject to delisting from The Nasdaq National Market. As a result of the previously-announced resignation of Deloitte & Touche LLP, Molex's former independent auditor, on November 13, 2004, the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 included in Molex's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 15, 2004 were not reviewed by an independent public accountant as required by Rule 10-01(d) of Regulation S-X. As disclosed in such Form 10-Q filing, Nasdaq views the Company as delinquent in its filing obligations in these circumstances. Nasdaq has modified and appended an "E" to the trading symbols for Molex common stock (MOLXE) and Class A common stock (MOLAE) which will remain until Molex has remedied this non-compliance. The Molex hearing request delivered to Nasdaq today stays the delisting of the Company's securities pending the Panel's decision. Molex expects to request a time extension sufficient to allow a successor independent registered public accounting firm to complete its review of the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 and for Molex to file an amendment to the Form 10-Q for that quarter with the SEC. There can be no assurance the Panel will grant the Company's request for such an extension of time. Filing the planned amendment to the Form 10-Q after the accounting review of the interim financial statements has been completed would make Molex current in its SEC filing obligations and in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirement. Statements in this release that are not historical are forward-looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molex's 10-K and other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and include Molex's ability to timely hire a new independent registered public accounting firm, Molex's ability to timely comply with SEC and Nasdaq reporting obligations, continued listing of Molex's common stock and Class A common stock on the Nasdaq National Market, economic conditions in various regions, product and price competition and foreign currency exchange rate changes. Molex does not undertake to revise these forward-looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise. The Company's Annual Report, as well as news releases and other supplementary financial data is available by accessing the Company's website at www.molex.com. Molex Incorporated is a 66-year-old manufacturer of electronic components, including electrical and fiber optic interconnection products and systems, switches and integrated products in 55 plants in 19 countries throughout the world.

EXHIBIT 16.1 [Letterhead of Deloitte & Touche LLP] November 30, 2004 Securities and Exchange Commission Mail Stop 11-3 450 5th Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20549 Dear Sirs/Madam: We have read Item 4.01 of Form 8-K of Molex Incorporated (the "Company") dated November 13, 2004 and have the following comments: FIRST PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in this paragraph. SECOND PARAGRAPH We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in this paragraph. THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS We agree with the statements made in these paragraphs. FIFTH PARAGRAPH We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in this paragraph, as we did not complete our review of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 prior to our resignation. SIXTH PARAGRAPH The statements made by the Company in the first four sentences of this paragraph are describing events which occurred in July 2004 shortly after the Company's June 30, 2004 fiscal year end and before the Company had issued a press release on July 27, 2004, announcing its fiscal 2004 results and before the Company filed, on September 10, 2004, its financial statements for fiscal 2004. Deloitte and Touche LLP ("Deloitte" or "D&T") did not become aware of such events until subsequent to October 14, 2004. Our comments below are based solely on discussions with management and the Audit Committee Chairman, and a written chronology (the "Chronology") prepared by the then, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") which was provided to us by the Audit Committee Chairman on November 2, 2004. Based upon the foregoing, we have the following comments: -1- * We agree with the statements made in the first sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, the issue was that intercompany profit included in "in-transit" inventory had not been eliminated in consolidation (the "PII Error"). This error resulted in an overstatement of inventory with a corresponding overstatement of income for each historical period in which the elimination was not made. * We disagree with the statement made in the second sentence of this paragraph because it is incomplete. The CFO's Chronology also indicates that at the July 21, 2004 meeting: (1) the President and Chief Operating Officer and one of the Co-Chairmen of the Company's Board of Directors also attended; (2) in addition to the PII Error, the possible reversal of a self- insurance reserve was discussed; and (3) the CFO's Chronology indicates that "the group also discussed whether this issue" (the PII Error) "should be reported to D&T and the Audit Committee as part of the year-end audit". * We disagree with the statements made in the third sentence of this paragraph because the Chronology indicates that the amount of the PII Error was known at the time of the July 21, 2004 meeting and was subject only to a determination as to how the PII Error had occurred. * We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with management's stated conclusions in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. With respect to the fifth sentence of this paragraph, we agree that the Company issued a press release on July 27, 2004. We make no comment as to the accuracy or completeness of the Company's press release. We agree with the statements made in the sixth sentence of this paragraph; however, such statements do not indicate that the representation letter was also later signed by the Executive Vice President/President Far East South, and that a second representation letter, dated September 10, 2004, reaffirming the representations made as of August 20, 2004, was provided to us and was signed by the Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and the CFO. SEVENTH PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in the first sentence of this paragraph. We disagree with the statements made in the second sentence of this paragraph because it is incomplete and inaccurately suggests that the amount of the PII Error was not known. The Company initially recorded approximately $2 million of the PII Error in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and indicated an intention of recording the remainder in the subsequent fiscal 2005 quarters. Also, the Company indicated that the reversal of the self- insurance reserve would be recorded to offset a portion of the remaining adjustments resulting from the PII Error. The Company's reference to a "full analysis of all inventory allowances" has no impact on the PII Error. -2- We agree with the statements made in the third sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, we had not previously been informed of the PII Error, nor were we informed in the October 15, 2004 meeting that the PII Error and self-insurance reserve matters had been identified by the Company prior to the filing of the Company's 2004 annual report on Form 10-K. We agree with the statements made in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, the Company had not recorded a reduction to its inventory allowances or self-insurance reserve at the time of the October 15, 2004 meeting. The Company's written analysis, provided to us at this meeting, also indicated that the reductions in the inventory component allowance of $300,000 to $500,000 were appropriate, and that the Company's accounts receivable reserve was potentially overstated by approximately $3 million to $4 million. We agree with the statements made in the fifth sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, the potential over accrual of the accounts receivable reserve of $3 million to $4 million was also discussed at the October 19, 2004 Audit Committee Meeting. We disagree with the statements made in the sixth sentence of this paragraph because as of October 19, 2004 we had performed no procedures regarding the amount of the PII Error and were not in a position to have been in agreement with such amount. We agree that we disagreed with the Company's proposed accounting treatment for the PII Error. We agree with the statement made in the seventh sentence as to the timing of recording of such adjustment, however, we disagree with the statement suggesting that the PII Error was an estimate. The amount of the PII Error was determinable and known to management. We agree with the statements made in the eighth sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, after the October 19, 2004 Audit Committee Meeting, the CFO informed us that if the Company were required to record the entire PII Error in the first quarter, she would offset the entry by recording adjustments to inventory allowances so that income for the quarter would not change from the preliminary income amount available at the time of the October 15, 2004 meeting. The reported income amount shown in the Company's October 20, 2004 press release and in its Form 10-Q filing for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 do not differ from the preliminary income amount available on October 15, 2004. With respect to the ninth sentence of this paragraph, we agree that the Company issued a press release on July 27, 2004. We make no comment as to the accuracy or completeness of the Company's press release. We agree with the statements made in the tenth sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, on October 21, 2004, we had not completed our procedures relating to the adjustment recorded by the Company for the reduction in inventory allowance since the support had not been provided to us by the Company. We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in the eleventh sentence of this paragraph. -3- EIGHTH PARAGRAPH We agree that the CFO made the statements as indicated in the first sentence of this paragraph; however, the CFO's characterization of the PII Error as "potential" was not correct because the amount of the PII Error was known in July 2004. We disagree with the statement made in the second sentence of this paragraph because it is incomplete and inaccurate. On October 28, 2004, we informed the Co-Chairmen of the Board that the CFO had knowledge of the errors prior to filing the June 30, 2004 Form 10-K and failed to disclose such errors to us. Later that day, we informed the Audit Committee Chairman. At that time we requested that the Audit Committee, with assistance of experienced counsel, conduct an investigation into the matter to determine the facts and circumstances surrounding the CFO's knowledge of the errors at the time she signed the representation letters; whether anyone else at the Company had knowledge of the errors; whether the CFO had instructed anyone to withhold such information from us; whether there were any other events which had transpired that had not been properly communicated; whether there were any other significant reserve adjustments, accounting matters or errors that had not been disclosed by management to us; and whether any illegal acts had occurred. We advised the Audit Committee Chairman that we would be unable to complete our review of the first quarter until the investigation was completed to our satisfaction and any remedial action was taken. We further informed the Audit Committee Chairman that it was highly unlikely that we would be willing to continue to rely on the CFO's representations in connection with our reviews or audits. We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in the third sentence of this paragraph as to the CEO's and CFO's actual beliefs; however, the stated beliefs are inconsistent with the written representations included in the representation letters to us dated August 20, 2004 and September 10, 2004 and signed by the CEO and CFO on September 10, 2004, which state, among other things, that there are no transactions (such as the PII Error and the self-insurance reserve over-accrual) that had not been properly recorded in the accounting records, and that no matters had come to management's attention subsequent to June 30, 2004 that required consideration as adjustments to or disclosures in the financial statements. We disagree with the statements made in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. As discussed above, on October 28, 2004 we requested that the Audit Committee conduct an investigation and informed them we would be unable to complete our review of the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 until such investigation had been completed to our satisfaction and any appropriate remedial action had been taken. NINTH PARAGRAPH We disagree with the statements made in the first sentence of this paragraph because they are incomplete. On November 1, 2004, we met with the CEO, and he informed us that he set the tone for communications and that he probably did discuss with the CFO not informing Deloitte of the PII Error; and that he had not read the representation letter prior to signing it. On November 2, 2004, the Chairman of the Audit Committee provided us with the Chronology prepared by the CFO stating that the matters in question had been discussed at the July 21, 2004 -4- management meeting. As a result of receiving this information, we informed the Chairman of the Audit Committee that our willingness to rely on representations of the CEO was now also in question. On November 3, 2004, we informed the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the following: (1) we had concluded that we were no longer willing to rely on the representations of either the CEO or the CFO; (2) the Audit Committee should conduct an investigation and engage outside independent counsel to directly assist the Audit Committee; and (3) we would be unable to complete our review of the first quarter until the investigation was completed to our satisfaction and any appropriate remedial actions were taken. We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in the second and third sentences of this paragraph. Such statements are consistent with the written report that was ultimately provided to us. We agree with the statements made in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. We disagree with the statements made in the fifth sentence of this paragraph because they are incomplete. On November 9, 2004, after receiving a verbal report on the results of the investigation, we informed the Audit Committee Chairman and independent counsel that the investigation was not complete and that additional work should be performed to; (1) resolve the discrepancies between the facts as presented to us by the investigators and the information contained in the Chronology, the comments made to us by the CEO discussed above and other information provided to us by the Audit Committee Chairman; (2) perform a search of personal files and emails to determine whether other individuals had knowledge of the matters and whether there were other accounting matters or errors that had not been disclosed to us; and (3) determine whether any illegal acts had occurred. We agree with the statements made in the sixth sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, the written report was provided to us on November 11, 2004 and a written supplement was provided to us on November 13, 2004. TENTH PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in the first sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, we were provided with a draft of the Form 12b-25 less than two hours before the filing deadline. We were in the process of providing our comments on the draft of the Form 12b-25 to the Company's outside counsel, when we were informed by them that there was insufficient time to consider our comments prior to the filing deadline. We make no comment as to the accuracy or completeness of the Company's Form 12b-25 filed on November 10, 2004. We agree with the statements made in the second sentence of this paragraph. We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in the third sentence of this paragraph; however, as previously stated, we had informed the Audit Committee Chairman that we were no longer willing to rely on the representations of either the CEO or the CFO. -5- We disagree with the statements made in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. Various members of Senior Management and the Board informed us that they believed the investigation could show that the CEO did not knowingly misrepresent matters to us. We informed the Company that we could reconsider our willingness to rely on the CEO's representations if the results of the investigation so warranted; however, as the investigation was not complete, we did not withdraw our previous communication regarding our unwillingness to rely on the CEO's representations. ELEVENTH PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in the first and fifth sentences of this paragraph. We disagree with the statements made in the second and third sentences of this paragraph as to the imposition of new conditions. We had previously communicated to the Audit Committee Chairman and the Co-Chairmen of the Board that we were unwilling to rely on the representations of the CEO and CFO and that their having roles in the Company in which they would have significant authority or responsibilities with respect to the Company's accounting books and records, financial reporting, or system of internal control would not be acceptable. After considering the Company's November 10, 2004 announcement that the Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer would be reassigned to the position of Vice President and Treasurer, we concluded that under the circumstances, the parameters of such previous communications would preclude both the CEO and former CFO from being officers of the Company. We informed the Company of such conclusion on November 13, 2004. We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. TWELFTH PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in the first and third sentences of this paragraph. We agree with the statements made in the second sentence as to the timing of recording of such adjustment, however, we disagree with the statements suggesting that the PII Error was an estimate as opposed to an error whose amount was determinable and known to management. We agree with the statements made in the fourth sentence of this paragraph. For purposes of clarity, we did not complete our review of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 prior to our resignation. In addition, we make no comment as to the accuracy or completeness of the Company's press release. THIRTEENTH PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in this paragraph. FOURTEENTH PARAGRAPH We agree with the statements made in the first sentence of this paragraph. -6- We have no basis upon which to agree or disagree with the statements made in the second sentence of this paragraph.

As previously disclosed, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), Molex's former independent registered public accounting firm, resigned on November 13, 2004. During the two most recent fiscal years and through December 9, 2004, the Company has not consulted with E&Y regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided that E&Y concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a reportable event required to be reported under paragraph 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. In connection with the potential engagement of E&Y, Molex and E&Y discussed the nature of the matters described in Item 4.01 of Molex's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 18, 2004 and in the Amendment to such Form 8-K (including the letter of Deloitte filed as an exhibit thereto) filed with the Commission on December 1, 2004, including the reportable event disclosed therein and the matter that was the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in paragraph 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with Deloitte. Molex has determined to adopt a number of measures designed to strengthen Molex's accounting and financial reporting infrastructure and processes, including Molex's intention to add a new director to the Board who would serve on the Audit Committee and qualify as a "financial expert," to hire a Chief Financial Officer to replace the Company's Acting Chief Financial Officer, who would continue to serve as an Executive Vice President and President, Far East South of Molex, and to conduct management and Audit Committee training on accounting, financial reporting and internal controls. In addition, Molex has taken other actions in connection with the transition to E&Y, including those described in the fifth paragraph under Item 5.02 herein. Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers. _________ _________________________________________________________ The Molex Board of Directors named Frederick A. Krehbiel, Co- Chairman of the Board of Directors, as Chief Executive Officer of Molex effective December 9, 2004. The Board also reviewed Molex's management succession plan and indicated that, while no definitive action has yet been taken by the Board, the current expectation is that Martin P. Slark, Molex's President and Chief Operating Officer, would replace Mr. Krehbiel as Chief Executive Officer during the first fiscal quarter following the end of Molex's current fiscal year on June 30, 2005. Frederick A. Krehbiel, age 63, has served as a director of Molex since 1972. In addition to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Krehbiel will continue to serve as Co- Chairman of the Board. Mr. Krehbiel was elected Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Molex in 1988 and Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1993. He became Co-Chairman in 1999 and served as Co-Chief Executive Officer from 1999 to 2001. Mr. Krehbiel also serves on the board of directors of Tellabs, Inc., W. W. Grainger, Inc. and DeVry Inc. As previously disclosed, Frederick A. Krehbiel and John H. Krehbiel, Jr., the Co-Chairman of the Board, are brothers and Fred L. Krehbiel, the President of the Connector Products Division (Americas) and a director of Molex, is the son of John H. Krehbiel, Jr. (collectively the "Krehbiel Family"). The members of the Krehbiel Family may be considered "control persons" of Molex. Reference is made to Molex's proxy statement filed with the SEC on September 15, 2004 for information regarding Frederick A. Krehbiel's employment arrangements with Molex. Martin P. Slark, age 49, has served as President and Chief Operating Officer of Molex since July 1, 2001 and as a director of Molex since 2000. Mr. Slark has worked at Molex since 1976 filling various administrative, operational and executive positions both internationally and domestically. Prior to his current position, he served as Executive Vice President from 1999- 2001. Mr. Slark serves on the board of directors of Hub Group, Inc. In addition, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of J. Joseph King from his positions as Molex's Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors on December 9, 2004. Mr. King will continue to serve Molex in a staff function with responsibilities that include strategic planning and coordination of certain Molex functional areas. The Board also accepted the resignation of Diane Bullock from her positions as Vice President and Treasurer. Ms. Bullock will continue to serve Molex in a staff function with responsibilities that include the coordination of Molex's global procurement and logistics strategy and overseeing Molex's global lean manufacturing program. Neither Mr. King nor Ms. Bullock will be elected an officer of Molex, nor will their positions involve or significantly influence accounting, financial reporting or internal controls. The Board of Directors' actions were taken to facilitate the transition to a new independent auditor and include the conditions requested by Molex's previous independent auditor.

Molex also announced the appointment of Frederick A. Krehbiel, a current Co-Chairman of the Board of Directors, as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and provided guidance regarding Molex's Chief Executive Officer succession plan. Ernst & Young will commence serving as Molex's independent auditor effective immediately and will begin reviewing Molex's financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 under Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100 "Interim Financial Information".

Filing the planned amendment to the Form 10-Q after the SAS 100 review of the interim financial statements has been completed would make Molex current in its SEC filing obligations and in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirement. The Molex Board of Directors named Frederick A. Krehbiel, Co- Chairman of the Board of Directors, as Chief Executive Officer of Molex effective December 9, 2004. Mr. Krehbiel previously served as Molex's Chief Executive Officer from 1988 to 1998 and as its Co-Chief Executive Officer from 1999 to 2001.

UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 _________________ FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 February 14, 2005 ------------------------------------------------ Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) Molex Incorporated ------------------------------------------------------ (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) Delaware 0-7491 36-2369491 --------------- ----------- -------------- (State or other (Commission (IRS Employer jurisdiction File Number) Identification of incorporation) No.) 2222 Wellington Court, Lisle, Illinois 60532 ----------------------------------------- ---------- (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) (630) 969-4550 ---------------------------------------------------- (Registrant's telephone number, including area code) Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below): [ ] Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) [ ] Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) [ ] Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition. - --------- ---------------------------------------------- On February 14, 2005, Molex Incorporated issued a press release announcing its preliminary results of operations for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004. The press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference. The information furnished under Item 2.02 and Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing. - --------- ----------------------------------------------------- As previously disclosed, Molex received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") on November 15, 2004 indicating that Molex was not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14)). That rule requires Molex to file with Nasdaq copies of all reports filed or required to be filed with the SEC. Molex received this letter because Molex's unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 included in Molex's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 15, 2004 had not been reviewed by an independent public accountant under Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100 "Interim Financial Information" ("SAS 100") as required by SEC rules. The November 15, 2004 letter indicated that Molex's securities were subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market. Because Molex had not filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 by February 9, 2005, Molex is also not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) with respect to that filing. As a result, Molex received a letter from Nasdaq on February 11, 2005 indicating its non-compliance with such rule. As permitted by Nasdaq rules, Molex requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel to review the determination of the Nasdaq staff described above and a hearing was held on December 15, 2004. The Nasdaq Panel granted Molex an exception to the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq National Market that provides Molex with an opportunity to remedy the filing deficiencies described above on or before February 15, 2005. Molex subsequently requested and was granted an extension with respect to such exception to March 17, 2005. The Nasdaq Panel's determination to provide this exception and extension is subject to certain conditions, including that (1) Molex file an amended Form 10-Q for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 and a Form 10-Q for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004 on or before March 17, 2005; and (2) Molex timely file all periodic reports with the SEC for all reporting periods ending on or before December 31, 2006; provided that the filing of a Form 12b-25 will not automatically result in an extension of the filing deadlines for the purposes of this condition. The Nasdaq Panel has reserved the right to reconsider the conditions to the continued listing of our securities in the event that any event, condition or circumstance arises that, in its opinion, would make the continued listing of such securities inadvisable or unwarranted. The Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council has the right to review the Nasdaq Panel's decision within 45 days of issuance of the decision and may affirm, modify, reverse, dismiss or remand the decision. Molex expects to file the planned amendment to the first quarter Form 10-Q and the second quarter Form 10-Q after the accounting review of the interim financial statements is completed and prior to March 17, 2005. If accomplished, Molex would then be current in its SEC filing obligations and in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirement. The fifth character "E" will remain appended to the trading symbols of Molex's securities listed on the Nasdaq National Market pending a determination by Nasdaq that Molex has fully complied with the Nasdaq's filing requirement and has evidenced compliance with all other continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq National Market. Additional information regarding the matters described above is available in Molex's press release dated February 14, 2005 attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits. - --------- ---------------------------------- The following exhibits are being furnished as part of this Form 8-K: Exhibit Number Description -------------- ------------ 99.1 Press release of Molex Incorporated dated February 14, 2005.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY 2005 FISCAL SECOND QUARTER AND SIX MONTH RESULTS; PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS; SCHEDULES CONFERENCE CALL TODAY AT 4:00 P.M. (CST) Lisle, Ill., USA - February 14, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLXE and MOLAE - see note), a global electronic components company, today announced its preliminary results for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2004. Molex also announced its preliminary results for the six months ended December 31, 2004, that reflect certain adjustments to its results of operations for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. Molex also provided guidance for the third and fourth fiscal quarters, and an update regarding the status of its anticipated filings of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and efforts to regain Nasdaq compliance regarding the listing of the Company's common stock. Fiscal Second Quarter - --------------------- Molex currently anticipates that its 2005 second fiscal quarter net revenue will be $651.8 million, an increase of 18.7 percent from last year's second quarter of $549.0 million. Revenue in local currencies increased 15.7 percent, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $16.6 million when compared with last year's second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 included $17.7 million from an automotive acquisition in Europe that was completed on April 2, 2004. Molex anticipates that its net income for the 2005 second fiscal quarter will be $52.2 million compared with last year's second quarter of $41.2 million, an increase of 26.7 percent. Currency translation increased net income by $1.0 million, when compared with last year's second quarter. Earnings per share for the 2005 second fiscal quarter are expected to be $0.27, compared with $0.21 for the second quarter a year ago. Operating results for the 2005 second fiscal quarter are below the Company's previous guidance and were impacted by increases in raw material costs (copper, gold and plastic resins) that reduced pre-tax profit by approximately $8.2 million ($6.0 million after tax) when compared to the 2004 second fiscal quarter, and by $2.8 million ($2.0 million after tax) when compared to the 2005 first fiscal quarter. The Company's operating results were also negatively impacted by the weakness of the U.S. dollar, especially when compared to the yen and euro. For example, in a weakening U.S. dollar environment, margins are reduced when products manufactured in Japan at costs denominated in yen, are then sold in the Far East South at selling prices primarily denominated in, or closely linked to, the U.S. dollar. The Company estimates this negative currency transaction effect on 2005 second fiscal quarter pre-tax profit to be approximately $3.5 million ($2.6 million after tax) when compared to the 2004 second fiscal quarter, and by $4.4 million ($3.2 million after tax) when compared to the 2005 first fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company experienced a higher level of sales price erosion in the 2005 second fiscal quarter when compared to the 2005 first fiscal quarter. The preliminary results for the second fiscal quarter include a change of estimate of the Company's reserve for inventory, resulting in a reduction of the Company's reserve, and a corresponding favorable impact on pre-tax income of approximately $1.5 million ($1.1 million after tax). Regional Revenue Results - ------------------------ Revenue in the Far East South region for the 2005 second fiscal quarter is estimated at $204.2 million, an increase of 33.8 percent in dollars and 32.6 percent in local currencies from last year's second fiscal quarter. Revenue in the Far East North region (Japan and Korea) for the 2005 second fiscal quarter is estimated at $133.8 million, an increase of 1.9 percent in dollars and a decrease of 1.4 percent in local currencies from last year's second fiscal quarter. Revenue in the Americas region for the 2005 second fiscal quarter is estimated at $170.9 million, an increase of 2.0 percent from last year's second fiscal quarter. Revenue in Europe for the 2005 second fiscal quarter is estimated at $128.8 million, including $17.7 million from the previously mentioned automotive acquisition, an increase of 50.8 percent in dollars and 39.5 percent in local currencies from last year's second fiscal quarter. Operating Results - ----------------- Gross profit margin for the 2005 second fiscal quarter is estimated to be 34.0 percent compared with last year's second quarter margin of 32.7 percent. Pre-tax return on sales was 11.0 percent for the 2005 second fiscal quarter compared with 10.3 percent in last year's second quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 was 27.0 percent, the same as in last year's second quarter. Net return on sales for the 2005 second fiscal quarter is estimated to be 8.0 percent compared with 7.5 percent in last year's second quarter. Cash and marketable securities were $412.0 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $331.4 million at September 30, 2004. The Company's order backlog on December 31, 2004 was approximately $285.7 million, an increase of $59.1 million, or 26.1 percent compared with $226.6 million as of December 31, 2003. The impact of changes in currency rates accounts for approximately $9.6 million of the increase in order backlog. New orders for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $607.8 million, an increase of 7.7 percent compared with last year's second quarter. Research and Development Expenditures and Capital Spending - ---------------------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were approximately $34.5 million, an increase of 25.5 percent when compared with the same period last year. Capital expenditures were approximately $56.9 million for the 2005 second fiscal quarter versus $38.6 million in last year's second quarter. Six Month Results and First Fiscal Quarter Adjustments - ------------------------------------------------------ Molex currently anticipates that its net revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2004 will be $1.292 billion, compared with $1.046 billion in the first six months of the prior fiscal year, a 23.5 percent increase. Molex anticipates that its net income for the first six months of fiscal 2005 will be $104.7 million compared with net income of $73.3 million in the first six months of the prior fiscal year, a 42.8 percent increase. Earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2004 are expected to be $0.55, a 44.7 percent increase as compared with $0.38 reported for the first six months of the prior fiscal year. For the six-month period, currency translation increased net revenues by approximately $35.0 million and increased net income by $3.0 million. The foregoing results for the six months ended December 31, 2004 include the Company's review of certain accounting matters and practices that resulted in adjustments to the Company's first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004. This review resulted in correction of errors in the Company's reserve for accounts receivable, its accrual for vacation pay, in the recording of a contingent gain, and in the recording of the first quarter profit- in-inventory charge. The correction in the Company's reserve for accounts receivable resulted in a reduction of such reserve by approximately $4.1 million ($3.0 million after tax), which change had a positive impact on pre-tax income for the 2005 first fiscal quarter. The other corrections, which had a negative impact on pre-tax income for the 2005 first fiscal quarter, resulted in an increase in the Company's vacation accrual of approximately $5.5 million ($4.0 million after tax), the reversal of a contingent gain previously recorded in the 2005 first fiscal quarter of $1.9 million ($1.4 million after tax), on the sale of an investment that provides for potential earn-out payments, and an increase of $1.1 million ($0.8 million after tax) in the previously disclosed profit-in-inventory charge. In addition, the Company made a correction of an error in its calculation of inventory reserve that had a positive impact on pre-tax income for the 2005 first fiscal quarter of $0.1 million. As a result of these adjustments, pre-tax income for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2004 was $72.2 million, net income was $52.5 million, and earnings per share (basic and diluted) was $0.28. The previously disclosed results in the Company's Form 10-Q for such fiscal quarter, which did not reflect these adjustments, were pre-tax income of $76.6 million, net income of $55.6 million, and earnings per share (basic and diluted) of $0.29. These adjustments will be reflected in the planned amendment to the Company's Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2005 described below. Fiscal Third Quarter and Fourth Quarter Outlook - ----------------------------------------------- Based on current market conditions, the Company expects net revenue in the third fiscal quarter to be in a range of $630 million to $640 million. Achieving the midpoint of this range represents a decline of approximately $17 million from net revenue for the second fiscal quarter. This anticipated sales decline reflects weaker demand particularly in the following segments: European telecom; Japanese domestic market for certain digital products; as well as a post Christmas pause in the mobile communications and consumer electronics markets in the Far East South as our customers change models. In addition, as a significantly higher amount of the Company's business is now done in the Far East South, the impact of the shut down for Chinese New Year is expected to be greater during the third fiscal quarter. Net revenue for last year's third fiscal quarter was $569.2 million. The Company also expects further impact from higher manufacturing costs on Japanese export products due to the increase in the value of the yen, as well as increased costs for plastic resins. The Company will incur additional legal and accounting costs, currently estimated at approximately $2.6 million pre-tax. As a result, the Company expects earnings per share in the third fiscal quarter to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.24, compared with $0.24 in last year's third quarter. The Company is moving quickly to respond to this downturn. Plans are being implemented to reduce expenses throughout our global operations. The Company is also accelerating production transfers from Japan to manufacturing facilities within China. For example, the Company plans to increase the manufacturing output of its facility in Dalian, China, approximately 60 percent by the end of the current fiscal year. The Company also plans to add 60 percent to the square footage of its largest manufacturing facility in Shanghai, also by the end of the current fiscal year. In addition, the Company expects to build a sixth manufacturing facility in China located in the country's southwest region. Sales and profit for the fourth fiscal quarter are expected to increase over the high end of the third fiscal quarter estimates. The Company will provide an update for the fourth fiscal quarter in the third fiscal quarter earnings release. Accounting Matters - ------------------ On December 9, 2004, Molex's Audit Committee engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its independent public accounting firm. Ernst & Young is working to complete its review of Molex's financial statements for the first and second fiscal quarters of fiscal 2005 under Statement of Auditing Standards No. 100 "Interim Financial Information" ("SAS 100"). Subsequent to the engagement of Ernst & Young and the Nasdaq hearing described below, Molex received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance regarding Molex's Exchange Act filings. Molex submitted its response to the SEC, received a follow-up letter from the SEC, and submitted a further response to the SEC. Molex recently received an additional follow-up letter from the SEC and is in the process of preparing its response. While Molex believes that it has appropriately accounted for the adjustments described in this press release, certain of the SEC comments being addressed by the Company question whether some of such adjustments are being properly recorded in the appropriate period. Molex plans to file an amendment to its Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2005 and to file its Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter of 2005 as soon as practicable after Ernst & Young has completed its SAS 100 review of the quarterly financial statements to be included in such filings. The Company expects that this will occur after the SEC staff's comments have been satisfactorily resolved. Nasdaq Matters - -------------- Because Molex had not filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 by February 9, 2005, Molex is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). That rule requires Molex to file with Nasdaq copies of all reports filed or required to be filed with the SEC. Molex received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq") on February 11, 2005 indicating its non-compliance with such rule. In connection with this, Molex had requested and received a second extension that provides Molex with an opportunity to remedy its non-compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq National Market on or before March 17, 2005. Earlier on November 15, 2004, Molex had received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that Molex was not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) because Molex's unaudited financial statements for the 2005 first fiscal quarter included in Molex's Form 10-Q filed with the SEC had not been reviewed by an independent public accountant under SAS 100. The November 15, 2004 letter indicated that Molex's securities were subject to delisting from the Nasdaq National Market. Molex requested and was granted an extension to February 15, 2005. As noted above, this deadline subsequently was extended to March 17, 2005. Molex expects to file the planned amendment to the first quarter Form 10-Q and the second quarter Form 10-Q after the accounting review of the interim financial statements is completed and prior to March 17, 2005. If accomplished, Molex would then be current in its SEC filing obligations and in compliance with the applicable Nasdaq continued listing requirement. * * * * Details of Earnings Conference Call - ----------------------------------- The Company's conference call will be held at 4:00 p.m. CST (5:00 p.m. ET) on Monday, February 14, 2005.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS 2005 FISCAL THIRD QUARTER RESULTS ANNOUNCES CHARGE FOR PRODUCTION TRANSFERS AND COST REDUCTIONS TO BE TAKEN IN 2005 FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2006 BOARD INCREASES STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $250 MILLION and ANNOUNCES ELECTION OF NEW CEO AND COO EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005 Lisle, Ill., USA -- April 25, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today announced results for its third fiscal quarter and first nine-months ended March 31, 2005 and a manufacturing plant realignment program designed to reduce long-term costs and better optimize plant utilization. The Company also announced general and administrative cost reduction initiatives and an increase in its stock repurchase program. Fiscal Third Quarter Results ____________________________ Revenue of $612.8 million increased 7.7 percent from last year's third fiscal quarter of $569.2 million. Revenue in local currencies rose 4.7 percent as currency translation increased net revenue by $17 million when compared to last year's third fiscal quarter. Revenue for the third fiscal quarter included $18.6 million from a business that was acquired in April 2004. Revenue declined sequentially from the second fiscal quarter by $39 million, primarily due to the mobile phone and computer markets that were down approximately $22 million and $10 million respectively. This was due to a combination of model changeovers, slower production after a significant holiday ramp, and inventory adjustments by our customers. There were modest increases in both the automotive and telecom infrastructure markets offset by modest reductions in other market segments. When compared with last year's third fiscal quarter, revenue in the Far East South increased by 20.2 percent in dollars and 18.4 percent in local currency. In the Far East North (Japan and Korea), revenue increased 3.9 percent in dollars and decreased 1.4 percent in local currency. In the Americas, revenue declined 8.5 percent. In Europe, revenue increased 22.8 percent in dollars and 16.3 percent in local currency. Excluding the business acquired in April 2004, revenue increased 4.0 percent in dollars and declined 2.4 percent in local currency. Net income of $44.8 million decreased 1.4 percent from last year's third fiscal quarter of $45.5 million. Currency translation increased net income by $1.3 million compared with last year's third quarter. Earnings per share were $0.24 compared with $0.24 for last year's third quarter. Included in the results for this year's third quarter was a gain of $4.9 million pretax ($3.6 million after-tax) resulting from additional consideration earned from the previous sale of an equity investment in an affiliate. Also included in the quarter was $2.5 million in legal and accounting costs arising from the previously announced resignation of the Company's former auditors and subsequent related events. The Company continues to be negatively impacted relative to the prior year by higher raw material costs. The Company has been somewhat successful in passing on these increases to its distribution sales channel (20 percent of total sales), however any price increases to the remaining sales channels have not fully recovered the higher costs. The level of sales price erosion for the third fiscal quarter improved to a level modestly below the Company's normal 5 percent year-over-year expectation. The order backlog on March 31, 2005 stood at $264 million compared with $263 million a year ago. Without the impact of changes due to currency translation, the backlog would have been $259 million. Research and development expenditures for the third quarter were $32.8 million, compared with $29.9 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $49.8 million for the third quarter, compared with $50.3 million for the same period last year. Cash and marketable securities were $447 million at March 31, 2005, compared with $412 million at December 31, 2004 and $351 million at March 31, 2004. Plant Realignment and Cost Reduction Program and Related Charges ________________________________________________________________ The Company also announced that it plans to realign part of its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize its plant utilization and to reduce SG&A. As a result, the Company expects to take an estimated pretax charge of $25 to $30 million in the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and an additional estimated pretax charge of $20 to $30 million during fiscal 2006. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions and the resulting fiscal 2006 charge will be dependent upon a number of factors including the Company's efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. The facility closures involve the Company's operations in the Americas and Europe. In the Americas, the Company will close an industrial manufacturing facility in New England and cease manufacturing in its Detroit automotive facility. The automotive development center also located in Detroit will continue in operation. Production from these facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. In Europe, the Company will close manufacturing facilities in Ireland and Portugal, and reduce the size of a development center in Germany. Production from these manufacturing facilities will be transferred to existing plants within the region. Included in the charge is an amount to expense certain product related tooling in the Far East South and Europe. Also included in the charge will be costs to reduce the Company's selling, general and administrative costs in the Americas, Europe, and at the corporate office. The Company estimates that it will reduce headcount by approximately 1,200 people partially offset by additions at the facilities where production is being transferred. Total savings from the restructuring have not yet been finalized; and the Company expects to provide additional information in the future. The Company also advised that in addition to the restructuring charge, in May 2005 it will conduct its annual impairment review of goodwill, intangible assets and investments in subsidiaries and that non-cash charges could be taken once the review is completed. Fred Krehbiel, Co-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "This is an extremely difficult but necessary step towards a more focused manufacturing base in order to meet the requirements of our customers. At the same time, we are working to reduce our SG&A to a level that is both competitive and sustainable and ultimately to provide the level of returns Molex and our shareholders expect. Implementation of this restructuring will begin in the fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and will continue through fiscal 2006. We expect to provide additional details as we move through the process." Nine-Month Results __________________ Revenue for the nine-months ended March 31, 2005 was $1.9 billion, an increase of 18.0 percent compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue for the nine-months included $54.2 million from a business that was acquired in April 2004. Net income of $149.6 million increased 25.9 percent compared with last year's net income of $118.7 million. Earnings per share were $0.78 compared with $0.62 reported for the prior fiscal year. For the nine-months, currency translation increased revenue by $51.4 million and increased net income by $4.3 million. Senior Management Promotions ____________________________ The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has elected Martin Slark as Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer effective July 1, 2005, consistent with the succession plan announced in the Company's December 9, 2004 press release. The Company also announced that Liam McCarthy has been elected President and Chief Operating Officer effective July 1, 2005. During his 28-year career at Molex, McCarthy (49) has held diverse functional positions in all four of the Company's geographic regions. He began his career as a Cost and Management Accountant at Molex Ireland, followed by operating assignments in Japan, Singapore, and the Americas where he served as President of the Data-Communication division. Prior to this promotion, he was Vice President of Operations, Europe. In addition, Molex announced effective June 30, 2005, that Werner Fichtner, President of Europe for 23 years will be retiring and that taking his place will be Graham Brock (50). Brock has been with Molex for 28 years and has held positions in the U.S. and Europe and currently serves as Vice President of Sales and Marketing in Europe. The Company also announced the timing of the retirement of Ron Schubel who has been with Molex for 23 years and has served as President of the Americas for the last 7 years. Schubel will begin to transfer his duties to Dave Root effective October 1, 2005 and then move in April 2006 to a corporate role prior to his retirement in October 2006. Root (51) has been with Molex 23 years, including assignments as General Manager of Molex operations in both Hong Kong and Singapore. Currently he is Vice President of Sales and Marketing in the United States. Fiscal Fourth Quarter Operations Outlook ________________________________________ The Company expects net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2005 to be in a range of $625 million to $640 million. This estimate includes a sequential increase in both the mobile phone and computer markets, but not to the levels seen in the 2005 second fiscal quarter. Earnings per share after the charge are expected to be in a range of $0.13 to $0.15. The estimated reduction in earnings per share from the charge, assuming the mid-range, is expected to be $0.11. Short-term market indicators for the Company are mixed. Orders have strengthened in March and early April, but lead times are short and it is difficult to forecast expected results. However, the Company believes it is well positioned for profitable growth from global market opportunities. Molex's competitive advantages include a strong balance sheet, its emphasis on growth via new products, and its ability to design, manufacture and service customers anywhere in the world. As one of the first in the industry to manufacture in the Far East, the Company has important customer relationships and significant technical resources making it a leader in this fast growing region. Today, Molex has four integrated design centers and 24 factories in the region. Molex currently has six factories in China, is completing additions to two, and finalizing plans to build a seventh. Added Mr. Krehbiel, "I am as excited now about the Company's future as I have ever been. We have a terrific management team and tremendous future potential." Increase in Stock Buyback Authorization _______________________________________ The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase Molex shares on a discretionary basis. The authorization allows the repurchase of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (MOLX) and/or Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) during the period ending December 31, 2006 up to an aggregate value of $250 million. This replaces the Company's current authorization to repurchase shares up to an aggregate value of $100 million during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. Under this authorization the Company had purchased 940,000 shares of MOLXA at a total cost of $23.6 million. * * * * * * Statements in this release that are not historical including those in the "Fiscal Fourth Quarter Operations Outlook" are forward-looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX WILL EXPAND ERNST & YOUNG LLP AUDIT ENGAGEMENT Fiscal 2005 results to be released on September 8, 2005 Analyst Meeting to be held on September 13, 2005 Updates Outlook for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2005 FY06 Outlook to be released July 26, 2005 with a conference call at 4:00PM CDT Lisle, Ill., USA -- July 19, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors has requested Ernst & Young LLP to audit its financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2004. In December 2004, the Company announced that it had retained Ernst & Young to replace its former auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, and audit Molex's financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. In connection with its fiscal year end processes, Molex discussed engaging its former auditor to perform the procedures considered necessary in order to deliver a written consent to use the previously audited financial statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004. The former auditor advised Molex that it did not wish to accept this engagement, but did not withdraw its previously issued audit reports with respect to such financial statements. Molex's Audit Committee has requested Ernst & Young to audit the fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 financial statements in addition to performing an audit of Molex's fiscal 2005 financial statements. Ernst & Young is in the process of assessing its independence with respect to fiscal years 2003 and 2004, and has stated that it will accept this engagement if it determines that it is independent with respect to those years. Due to the need to expand the scope of Ernst & Young's audit engagement from one fiscal year to three fiscal years, Molex expects that its fiscal 2005 results will be released on September 8, 2005 and a webcast conference call will be held promptly following the release. Molex expects to file its Form 10-K, including audited financial statements, on or before the September 13, 2005 filing deadline. June Quarter FY05 Outlook _________________________ Molex also announced that, based on a preliminary review of operating results for the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2005, it remains comfortable with the guidance for operating results as provided in its April 25, 2005 press release. Further, the total restructuring and building impairment charge previously estimated to be in a range of $25 to $30 million pre- tax is now expected to be in the range of $30 to $35 million pre- tax.

EXHIBIT 99.1 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX ANNOUNCES OUTLOOK FOR FULL YEAR FISCAL 2006 AND FIRST QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2005 Lisle, Ill., USA -- July 26, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today announced its outlook for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, and for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005. Outlook ------- Fiscal Year 2006 outlook ------------------------ The Company anticipates that its growth in fiscal 2006 will be led by the Far East North and Far East South regions, while business in the Americas and Europe is expected to increase modestly. The Company expects strong demand for digital consumer products, including high definition televisions and digital audio players, hand-held devices and data storage products. In the industrial and distribution markets the Company expects solid growth, but with below average growth rates expected in telecom infrastructure and automotive markets. The Company also expects to continue to increase sales in the medical and commercial military markets. Based on these conditions, the Company estimates that net revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 will be in a range of $2.675 billion to $2.750 billion. Based on these net revenue expectations, earnings per share including a pre-tax restructuring charge expected to be between $15.0 million and $25.0 million, are estimated to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.12. The reduction in earnings per share from this restructuring charge is estimated to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.09. Two items included in these estimates are expected to reduce fiscal 2006 earnings per share in total by approximately $0.08. These are: - Adoption of FASB 123(R) requiring the expensing of stock option costs. This non-cash accounting charge is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2006 earnings per share by approximately $0.05, and is expected to reduce first fiscal quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.01. - An increase in the effective tax rate to 28.5 percent, compared with 27.0 percent reported for the first three quarters of fiscal 2005, primarily due to anticipated changes in the mix of earnings by country. This is expected to negatively impact fiscal 2006 earnings per share by approximately $0.03, and is expected to reduce first fiscal quarter earnings per share by less than $0.01. Update on cost reduction plan and expected annual savings --------------------------------------------------------- The Company has made substantial progress in its plan to realign part of its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize its plant utilization. At the time the cost reduction plan was announced in April 2005, the Company expected a pre-tax charge for restructuring in the range of $25 million to $30 million for fiscal 2005 and $20 million to $30 million for fiscal 2006. The Company now anticipates that the fiscal 2005 pre-tax charge will be in the range of $30 million to $35 million and that the fiscal 2006 charge will be in the range of $15 million to $25 million. The timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken. The actual timing of the facility closures and related headcount reductions are dependent upon a number of factors, including the Company's efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transfer of production. Though it is difficult to precisely forecast the timing of the plant closures and the amount of realizable cost savings, the Company expects that the pre-tax savings from the restructuring activities will be in the range of $10 million to $15 million for fiscal 2006. These savings are expected to be heavily weighted toward the end of the fiscal year, by which time the plant relocations are expected to be substantially completed. The full-year pre-tax impact for fiscal 2007 of these expected savings is estimated to be in the range of $32 million to $40 million. FY06 capital spending and research and development -------------------------------------------------- The Company estimates capital spending in fiscal 2006 to be in a range of $220 million to $240 million, primarily for investment in revenue producing assets, and for expanding our manufacturing in lower cost locations. The Company estimates spending for research and development in fiscal 2006 to be in a range of $145 million to $155 million. Fiscal first quarter outlook ---------------------------- For the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2005, the Company estimates that net revenue will be in a range of $640 million to $660 million. Based on these net revenue expectations, earnings per share including a pre-tax restructuring charge expected to be between $4 million to $6 million, are estimated to be in a range of $0.21 to $0.23. The reduction in earnings per share from this restructuring charge is estimated to be in a range of $0.01 to $0.03. Martin Slark, Chief Executive Officer, concluded, "Molex is well positioned for profitable growth from an increasing number of global market opportunities. As one of the first in the industry to manufacture in the Far East, we have important customer relationships and significant technical resources. Molex currently has six factories in China and expects to soon begin construction of a seventh. During fiscal 2006 we intend to continue the process of transitioning to a lower cost basis." Future corporate activities --------------------------- Molex has scheduled a conference call to discuss the above topics for 4:00 p.m. CDT on Tuesday, July 26, and is available live and in replay to all investors through the Internet by accessing the "Investors" section of the Company's website at www.molex.com. You may also dial (800) 603-3143 to participate in the conference call. International callers please dial (706) 634-0917. Please dial in at least five minutes prior to the start of the call. Molex will also offer a 48-hour replay of the conference call by dialing (800) 642- 1687 / ID 8117861. As previously announced on July, 19, 2005, the Company anticipates that its fiscal 2005 results will be released on September 8, 2005, and a web-cast conference call will be held promptly following the release. Molex expects to file its Form 10-K, including audited financial statements, on or before September 13, 2005. Molex's annual meeting with analysts will be held on September 13, 2005 in Chicago. In addition, the Company plans to schedule meetings during the same week in New York and San Francisco at which a condensed version of the September 13, 2005 presentations will be made. * * * * Statements in this release that are not historical are forward-looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and include, among others, the discussion under "Outlook" and "Future Corporate Activities" above. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with the timing of the Company's release of earnings as well as the timing and results of the audits of the Company's fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005 financial statements, and those associated with the operation of our business, including the risk that customer demand will decrease either temporarily or permanently, whether due to the Company's actions or the demand for the Company's products, and that the Company may not be able to respond through cost reductions in a timely and effective manner; price cutting, new product introductions and other actions by our competitors; fluctuations in the costs of raw materials that the Company is not able to pass through to customers because of existing contracts or market factors; the challenges attendant to plant closings and restructurings, including the difficulty of predicting plant closing and relocation costs, the difficulty of commencing or increasing production at existing facilities, and the reactions of customers, governmental units, employees and other groups; the challenges attendant to plant construction; and the ability to realize cost savings from restructuring activities.

The Compensation Committee reviewed and determined fiscal 2006 salary levels for the officers listed on Exhibit 99.1 hereto. Such salary determinations, along with the effective dates thereof, are set forth in the schedule attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto. (b) Reviewed and approved Cash Merit Bonus Plan for Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the fiscal year 2006 cash merit bonus plan. This plan provides that cash bonuses will be paid to executive officers based on the achievement of certain profit before tax and individual performance objectives. The cash bonus opportunity for executive officers under such plan ranges from 0% to 150% of base salary. Payments to executive officers under the plan may be more or less than a target bonus as a function of the Company's results or individual performance. The cash bonus opportunity is 30% of base salary based on achievement of minimum performance goals, 60% of base salary based on achievement of target performance goals and 150% of base salary based on achievement of maximum performance goals. If minimum performance goals are not achieved, no bonus is payable under this plan. In addition, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may downwardly adjust the potential bonus award to a lesser percentage, including 0%, to take into consideration unusual events. An overview of the cash merit bonus plan is attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. (c) Reviewed and approved a revision to retirement arrangement with Goro Tokuyama. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved a revision to the previously disclosed retirement arrangement with Goro Tokuyama, Regional President of Molex's Far East North Region. The revisions reflect Mr. Tokuyama's previously announced resignation as an executive officer of the Company and take into account changes in Mr. Tokuyama's compensation due to a merit pay increase. An overview of the revised arrangement is attached as Exhibit 99.3 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. On July 28, 2005, the Molex Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, took the following actions regarding supplemental executive retirement benefits. Molex maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") that provides senior executives, including executive officers, with certain benefits upon retirement. All amounts payable under the SERP are payable in cash. In response to federal income tax law changes governing non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements, the Board approved freezing Molex's existing SERP in order to ensure that SERP benefits that are not subject to the new tax law continue to be provided under the terms of the SERP, without adverse tax consequences for the participants. At the same time, the Board approved a new Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that provides for supplemental retirement benefits that are subject to the new tax law, on terms and conditions intended to comply with the new tax law. A copy of such Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan is attached as Exhibit 99.4 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. On July 28, 2005, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, met and approved the adoption of the 2005 Molex Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which non-employee directors of the Company may defer their compensation for board service. The Plan provides that any non-employee director may elect to defer all or a portion of his or her director fees, including annual retainer, board meeting fees, and board committee meeting fees, paid by the Company to a deferred compensation account. A participant may elect to have the amount deferred (1) accrue interest during each calendar quarter at a rate equal to the six month Treasury Bill rate in effect at the beginning of each calendar quarter, or (2) credited as stock "units" whereby each unit is equal to one share of Molex common stock. If the participant elects to receive a stock-based rate of return, the number of deferred stock units credited to a participating director's account equals the amount of the deferred cash compensation divided by the fair market value of Molex common stock on the date the deferred fees would otherwise be paid. Dividend equivalents are earned on deferred stock units based upon the fair market value of a share of Molex Common Stock on the dividend payment date. At the time of distribution, any stock units are converted into cash by multiplying the number of units by the fair market value of the stock as of the payment date. The Plan provides that distribution of the aggregate value of the participant's account is to commence within 30 days of the earliest of the following events: (1) termination of service with Molex after age 59 1/2; or (2) age 59 1/2 if termination with Molex occurs before age 59 1/2; or (3) disability; or (4) death; or (5) an unforeseeable emergency (as defined in the Plan). The cumulative amount that is deferred for each participating director is subject to the claims of the general creditors of Molex. A copy of the Outside Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan is attached as Exhibit 99.5 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing summary description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such Plan. Item 8.01 Other Events. _________ ______________ On July 28, 2005, Molex issued a press release announcing an increase in the Company's cash dividend. The press release is filed as Exhibit 99.6 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Payment or payments shall be made in the form or forms elected by the Participant on the Participant's Deferral Forms. 6.4 Benefits Upon Disability.

Upon a Participant's death, the Committee shall pay to the Participant's Beneficiary a benefit equal to the remaining balance in the Participant's Account in a single lump sum payment. Payment shall be made as soon as administratively feasible following the Participant's death. 6.6 Payment Forms. (a) Unless a Participant otherwise elects in accordance with paragraph (b) below, a Participant's Account shall be paid in a single lump sum. (b) In lieu of a lump sum form of payment, a Participant may elect to receive distribution of any Deferred Amount in the form of substantially equal annual installment payments. A Participant may select the number of years over which the aggregate amount of any Deferred Amount is to be paid, up to a maximum of five years. Such election shall be made in the form required by the Committee and shall be filed with the Committee with each Deferral Form. During the payout period, earnings shall accrue on a Participant's Account in the manner provided in Section 7.3. The amount of each installment payment shall be equal to the balance remaining in the Participant's Account immediately prior to each such payment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one, and the denominator of which is the number of installment payments remaining, with the last installment consisting of the balance of the Participant's vested Account, as liquidated to close the Account. A Participant may change his or her benefit payment election only as described in Section 6.7. If no valid installment payment election is in effect when distribution is to be made, then payment of the Participant's Account shall be made in a single lump sum. 6.7 Changes to Time and Form of Payment. (a) A Participant may extend an existing Early Benefit Distribution election for any Expatriate Deferral and/or Participant Deferral under the Plan, provided the distribution shall be deferred to a date that is at least five years after the date the distribution would otherwise have commenced. (b) A Participant who has elected a lump sum distribution may later change such election to installment payments, selecting a payment period from one to five years, provided the first installment payment shall be deferred to a date that is at least five years after the date the lump sum distribution would otherwise have been made. (c) A Participant who has an installment payment election in effect may change such election so as to delay the start of the installment period (or extend the installment period to a maximum of five years), provided the first installment payment shall be deferred to a date that is at least five years after the date the initial installment payment would otherwise have commenced. A Participant, however, shall not be permitted to change an installment election to a lump sum payment. (d) Any such election changes shall be completed in accordance with Committee rules, and shall not be effective unless made more than twelve (12) months before the date payment would otherwise be made or begin to be made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, election changes that have the effect of accelerating the time for payment shall be prohibited. 6.8 Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant may request that all or a portion of his or her Account balance be distributed at any time by submitting a written request to the Committee demonstrating that he or she has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, and that the distribution is necessary to alleviate the financial hardship created by the Unforeseeable Emergency. The Committee shall have the sole discretionary authority to determine whether a Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency. Upon the finding that the Participant has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee shall distribute to the Participant in a lump sum that portion of his or her Account necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency, plus taxes attributable thereto, provided that the Committee has taken into account the extent to which the hardship is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, or by liquidation of the Participant's assets, unless such liquidation itself would cause a severe financial hardship. Distributions made pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be made as soon as administratively practicable after the Committee has reviewed and approved the request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, distributions due to Unforeseeable Emergencies shall only be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Treasury under Code Section 409A. 6.9 Source of Assets for Benefits.

Each Account may be further subdivided into subaccounts for the purpose of tracking the funds associated with each different form of payment and each Expatriate Deferral, if any. The establishment and maintenance of Participants' Accounts, however, shall not be construed as entitling any Participant to any specific assets of an Employer. 7.2 Deferred Amounts. Deferred Amounts shall be credited to a Participant's Account on the date of funding pursuant to Section 8.6. 7.3 Earnings and Losses. Each Participant's Account shall be credited with earnings (or losses) thereon daily or some less frequent time period as agreed upon by the Committee and the Trustee.

Except as provided in Section 8.4, the Trust shall consist of two or more separate investment funds as selected from time to time by the Committee among which Participants may elect to have their respective Deferred Amounts invested. Subject to the provision of Section 8.4, the Committee shall have the authority to select and change the number of investment funds available and to set the investment guidelines of each investment fund and to otherwise set policy and establish the funding strategies utilized by the Trust as the Committee may deem appropriate. All or any portion of any investment fund may, on a temporary basis, be retained in cash or invested in property other than that specified as the primary type of investment for such investment fund. Any investment fund may be partially or entirely invested in any common or commingled fund which is invested in property of the kind specified for such investment fund. 8.4 Investment Managers. The Committee may designate one or more investment managers to control and manage (including the power to direct the acquisition and disposition of) the investment funds and to make professional investment decisions or recommendations.

Subject to the provisions of Section 8.4, each Participant shall make an Investment Election to invest his or her Account among the investment funds provided for in Section 8.3 in any combination in multiples of one percent (1%). To the extent that a Participant shall have made no election hereunder, such Participant's Account shall be allocated to the investment fund having investment guidelines that contemplate the least risk of loss of principal as determined by the Committee. To the extent that a Participant makes no new election provided for hereunder in accordance with Section 5.6, the allocation of his or her Account among the investment funds shall remain unchanged. 9.2 Change of Prior Election. Subject to rules and procedures as the Committee may establish, each Participant may change the allocation of his Account among the investment funds provided for in Section 8.3 by making a new Investment Election. The Committee shall have the authority and discretion to limit reallocation or trading practices that the Committee or an Investment Manager determines to be abusive or adverse to the investment fund or to the interests of other Plan participants. 9.3 Form of Election. The Investment Elections shall be made in such form and in such manner as the Committee shall prescribe. 9.4 Transfer of Funds.

Article 10. Beneficiary Designation 10.1 Designation of Beneficiary. Each Participant shall be entitled to designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries who, upon the Participant's death, shall receive the amounts that otherwise would have been paid to the Participant under the Plan. All designations shall be signed by the Participant, and shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee. The Participant may change his or her designation of Beneficiary at any time, on a form prescribed by the Committee. The filing of a new Beneficiary designation form by a Participant shall automatically revoke all prior designations by that Participant. 10.2 Death of Beneficiary. In the event that all the Beneficiaries named by a Participant, pursuant to Section 10.1 herein, predecease the Participant, the Deferred Amounts that would have been paid to the Participant shall be paid to the Participant's estate. 10.3 Ineffective Designation.

EXHIBIT 99.5 MOLEX 2005 OUTSIDE DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN __________________________________________________________ (Effective as of January 1, 2005) ARTICLE I. GENERAL 1.1 Name of Plan - The name of this plan shall be the MOLEX DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (hereinafter the "PLAN"). 1.2 Purpose - The purpose of the PLAN is to extend to outside directors of MOLEX INCORPORATED (hereinafter referred to as "MOLEX") a vehicle under which they may elect in advance to defer and invest future earnings in order to provide a settlement source of funds at retirement. 1.3 Effective Date - The effective date of the PLAN is January 1, 2005. 1.4 Plan Year - The PLAN YEAR shall be a year commencing July 1 and ending the following June 30 until December 31, 2004. After December 31, 2004, the PLAN YEAR shall be a year commencing on January1 and ending the following December 31. 1.5 Eligibility - The outside directors of MOLEX (hereinafter "PARTICIPANTS") are eligible to participate in the PLAN. ARTICLE II. DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT 2.1 Establishment of Account - A separate deferred compensation account (hereinafter "ACCOUNT") will be established and maintained for each PARTICIPANT. 2.2 Aggregate Value of Account - The AGGREGATE VALUE of a PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT will be determined by the amount of compensation that the PARTICIPANT elects to defer ("DEFERRED COMP") plus the value added (or subtracted) from interest on cash equivalents, dividends and stock appreciation on stock equivalents depending on the growth pattern as more fully set forth in ARTICLE IV hereof. 2.3 Allocation of Deferred Compensation - DEFERRED COMP will be credited to the PARTICIPANT'S ACCOUNT as of the date such compensation would otherwise have been payable. ARTICLE III. INCOME TO BE DEFERRED 3.1 Type of Income - For each PLAN YEAR, a PARTICIPANT may defer any portion of his or her directors' fees. 3.2 Minimum Deferral - Any DEFERRED COMP for each PLAN YEAR must be at least $1,000.00 on an annual basis. ARTICLE IV. ACCOUNT GROWTH PATTERNS 4.1 Mutual Exclusivity for Each Annual Deferral - For each PLAN YEAR, a PARTICIPANT may choose to allow his ACCOUNT to accrue earnings (or losses) in accordance with one of the growth patterns set forth in this ARTICLE. Once DEFERRED COMP is credited to an established ACCOUNT, the PARTICIPANT may not switch prior DEFERRED COMP in that ACCOUNT for that year to an alternate growth pattern. The PARTICIPANT will be able to select an alternate growth pattern for future deferrals in other PLAN YEARS. 4.2 Interest Bearing Account - If an Interest Bearing Account is elected, the DEFERRED COMP for a particular PLAN YEAR will be treated as a cash ACCOUNT with interest compounded quarterly. The rate of interest shall change quarterly on the first day of July, October, January and April and be equal to the interest quoted for six-month treasury bills then in effect as determined by a brokerage firm or commercial bank. 4.3 Stock Account - If a stock account is elected, the DEFERRED COMP for a particular PLAN YEAR will be converted into stock units ("UNITS"), each UNIT corresponding to one share of MOLEX INCORPORATED Common Stock, $.05 par value ("STOCK"). The amount of UNITS shall be equal to the DEFERRED COMP dividend by the fair market value of the STOCK on the date the compensation would otherwise have been payable. The resulting number of UNITS shall be credited to the PARTICIPANT and said UNITS shall be increased by imputing dividends (either cash or stock) on each UNIT or fraction thereof which is credited to the PARTICIPANT under the PLAN on each dividend payable date. Such dividend UNITS will be converted into additional UNITS on the basis of current market value of the STOCK on the applicable payable date. At the time of payment of any portion of the ACCOUNT, the UNITS will be converted into cash by multiplying the number of UNITS to be paid at the payment date by the current fair market value of the STOCK as of the payment date. ARTICLE V. DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNT 5.1 Time of Distribution - The distribution of the AGGREGATE VALUE to a PARTICIPANT shall commence within thirty (30) days of the earliest of one of the following events: 1. termination of service with MOLEX after age 59 1/2; or 2. age 59 1/2 if termination with Molex occurs before age 59 1/2; or 3. disability; or 4. death; or 5. an unforeseeable emergency. 5.2 Form and Manner of Distribution - If PARTICIPANT'S service is terminated, he/she will receive payment of the AGGREGATE VALUE in accordance with PARTICIPANT'S written election or, in the event of an unforeseeable emergency, in a manner within the discretion of the ADMINISTRATOR as set forth in paragraph 7.2. 5.3 Definitions Under This Article - For purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply: 1. Disability shall mean that a PARTICIPANT is disabled by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last at least 12 continuous months and he or she is: * Unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity or * Receiving income replacement benefits for a period of not less than 3 months under an employer disability plan. 2.Unforeseeable Emergency shall mean: * Severe financial hardship resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of PARTICIPANT, spouse or dependent, * Loss of property due to casualty, or * Other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising from events beyond the PARTICIPANT'S control.

An overview of the amended and restated fiscal 2006 cash merit bonus plan (the "cash merit bonus plan") is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, and is incorporated herein by reference. The following summary of the cash merit bonus plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibit. The cash merit bonus plan covers all executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer.

The cash bonus opportunity is 30% of base salary based on achievement of minimum performance goals, 60% of base salary based on achievement of target performance goals (the "Target" referenced in Exhibit 99.1) and 120% of base salary based on achievement of maximum performance goals. If the minimum performance goals are not achieved, no bonus is payable under this plan. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may downwardly adjust the potential bonus award to a lesser percentage, if any, to take into consideration unusual events. In addition, the Committee, in its discretion, may award an additional percentage not to exceed 30% of base salary to reflect unusual contributions to Molex.

Exhibit 99.2 Contact: Neil Lefort Vice President, Investor Relations (630) 527-4344 MOLEX REPORTS RECORD REVENUE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 Reaffirms September quarter and fiscal year 2006 outlook Completes Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 compliance Investor meetings to be held in Chicago, San Francisco and New York Lisle, IL, USA - September 8, 2005 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ:MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended June 30, 2005, including record revenue for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2005. The Company also announced that the audit of its financial statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 has been completed, and that the financial results for those fiscal years remain as previously reported. FY2005 Fourth Quarter Results - ----------------------------- Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was $643.8 million, an increase of $11.9 million, or 1.9% over the prior year quarter. Revenue in local currencies decreased 1.0%, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $16.9 million over the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of the weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen and euro. Revenue in the Far East South region was $192.0 million, an increase of 9.0% over the prior year's quarter, primarily driven by demand from the digital consumer, PC, and mobile phone markets. In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $131.0 million, an increase of 1.4% in dollars and a decrease of 2.3% in local currencies. In the Americas, revenue of $187.8 million increased 1.2%. In Europe, revenue of $125.3 million remained flat in dollars and declined 6.3% in local currencies. Net Income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 was $4.9 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with $57.2 million, or $0.30 per share in the prior year quarter. The Company continues to realign its manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and optimize plant utilization. As a result, the Company recorded a previously announced restructuring charge of $27.9 million ($21.6 million after- tax) in the fourth fiscal quarter. The Company also recorded previously announced charges that included a non-cash goodwill impairment of $22.9 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), and building impairment of $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax). The reduction per share from these charges was $0.24. In addition, other non-operating items primarily related to tax adjustments increased net income by $5.4 million, or $0.03 per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 60.4%, principally impacted by the goodwill impairment charge for which no tax benefit was provided, and by a reduction of tax reserves. In addition, during the fourth fiscal quarter the Company adjusted the full fiscal year tax rate to 28.8%, compared with 27.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2005. Full FY2005 Results - ------------------- Revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2005 was a record $2.549 billion compared with $2.247 billion in the prior fiscal year, a 13.4% increase. Revenue in local currencies increased 10.2%, as currency translation increased net revenue by approximately $72.1 million over the prior fiscal year. Net income was $154.4 million, or $0.81 per share, compared with $176.0 million, or $0.92 per share in the prior fiscal year. These results for fiscal 2005 include a $0.24 per share reduction due to the charges mentioned above. The Company's order backlog on June 30, 2005 was $259.5 million, compared with $332.6 million on June 30, 2004. This decrease was partially attributable to significantly higher distribution orders recorded in the June fiscal 2004 quarter in advance of a price increase. In addition, during fiscal 2005 the Company provided additional vendor-managed inventory to customers. Under this method, the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. New orders for the fourth quarter were $651.6 million, up 7.2% sequentially, and have continued at an encouraging pace in the current September quarter. Cash and marketable securities were $497.6 million at June 30, 2005, compared with $447.2 million at March 31, 2005 and $338.7 million at June 30, 2004. Research and Development and Capital Spending - --------------------------------------------- Research and development expenditures for the fourth quarter were $32.9 million, compared with $34.8 million for the same period last year. Research and development expenditures for the twelve-month period were $133.6 million, compared with $119.0 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $75.7 million, up 36.5% compared with the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the twelve-month period were $230.9 million, up 21.7% compared with $189.7 million for the same period last year. Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was $55.2 million, compared with $57.6 million for the same period last year. Depreciation expense for the twelve-month period was $227.7 million, compared with $225.2 million for fiscal 2004. Stock Buyback Actions - --------------------- During the June quarter, the Company repurchased 1,030,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 425,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $34.6 million. These purchases were completed under a $250 million Board authorization for the period ending December 30, 2006. The Company has approximately $215 million remaining under the current authorization. September Quarter and FY2006 Outlook - ------------------------------------ Based on a current review of its forecast operating results, the Company remains comfortable with its guidance for operating results for the first quarter ending September 30, 2005, and the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006, as provided in its July 26, 2005 press release. FY2003 and FY2004 Audit - ----------------------- As previously announced on July 19, 2005, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors requested Ernst & Young LLP to audit the Company's financial statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 in addition to its fiscal 2005 audit. This has now been completed and the financial results for those fiscal years remain as previously reported.

Cash and marketable securities were $423.2 million at September 30, 2005, compared with $497.6 million at June 30, 2005 and $331.4 million at September 30, 2004. As described below, during the September quarter the Company spent $50.1 million to repurchase its common stock.
New Orders and Backlog
New orders for the first quarter of $693.2 million were encouraging, an increase of 11% over the prior year September quarter, and an increase of 6% sequentially from the quarter ended June 30, 2005. New orders for the first quarter reached their highest level since the June 2000 quarter. The Companys order backlog on September 30, 2005 was $288.0 million, compared with $313.6 million on September 30, 2004. A portion of this decline is due to the increased prevalence of providing vendor-managed inventory to customers. Under this method, the receipt of the new order and the shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog. The September quarter backlog increased 11% from $259.5 million on June 30, 2005.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the September quarter were $34.6 million, compared with $33.4 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $64.1 million, compared with $48.4 million for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the September quarter included approximately $10 million for buildings, primarily for expansion in China and facility consolidation within the Americas due to the restructuring. Depreciation expense was $53.4 million, compared with $56.5 million for the same period last fiscal year.
December 2005 Second Quarter Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2005, will improve sequentially to a range of $670 to $690 million. This represents an increase of 3 to 6 percent compared with last years second fiscal quarter. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.26 to $0.29. This forecast includes an estimated restructuring charge of $3.5 million ($2.5 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share) related to the previously announced restructuring activity.
Restructuring Charge Update for Fiscal 2006
The Company now expects that the total pretax restructuring charge for fiscal 2006 will be in a range of $15 to $20 million, compared with a previous estimate of $15 to $25 million.
Stock Buyback Actions
During the September quarter, the Company repurchased 1,430,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 543,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $50.1 million. The Companys Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $250 million of common stock through December 31, 2006. Approximately $165 million is remaining under the current authorization.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this release that are not historical are forward-looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and include, among others, the discussion under December 2005 Second Quarter Outlook and Restructuring Charge Update for Fiscal 2006 above. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with the operation of our business, including the risk that customer demand will decrease either temporarily or permanently, whether due to the Company's actions or the demand for the Company's products, and that the Company may not be able to respond through cost reductions in a timely and effective manner; price cutting, new product introductions and other actions by our competitors; fluctuations in the costs of raw materials that the Company is not able to pass through to customers because of existing contracts or market facto rs; the challenges attendant to plant closings and restructurings, including the difficulty of predicting plant closing and relocation costs, the difficulty of commencing or increasing production at existing facilities, and the reactions of customers, governmental units, employees and other groups; the challenges attendant to plant construction; and the ability to realize cost savings from restructuring activities. Other risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molexs documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2005. Molex disclaims any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise.

Lisle, IL, USA  January 19, 2006 -- Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported record revenue and orders for its second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.  In addition, the Company raised guidance for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2006.  
Second Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, was a record $697.3 million, an increase of 7.0% over the same period last fiscal year.  Revenue in local currencies rose 8.5%, as currency translation lowered net revenue by approximately $9.9 million, compared with last years second quarter.  Revenue for the December quarter increased 5.7% sequentially from the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
Net income for the December quarter was $58.5 million, or $0.31 per share, compared with $52.2 million, or $0.27 per share in the prior year quarter.  Included in the current quarter results was a restructuring charge of $6.5 million ($5.0 million after-tax or approximately $0.03 per share), relating to a previously announced restructuring program.
Revenue in the mobile phone market was very strong and increased 20% over last years second quarter, and 10% sequentially.  Revenue in the consumer market was also strong, increasing 12% over last year, and 11% sequentially.  Revenue in the automotive market increased 13% over last year, and was flat sequentially.  Revenue in the data products and industrial markets was flat, versus both the prior year and sequentially.
Revenue in the Far East South region, the Companys largest region, was $235 million, an increase of 15% over last years second quarter in dollars, and a similar increase in local currencies.  In the Far East North region (Japan and Korea), revenue was $130 million, a decline of 3% in dollars and an increase of 2% in local currencies.  In the Americas region, revenue of $198 million rose 16%, the highest growth rate in several years.  In Europe, revenue of $117 million declined 9% in dollars and 3% in local currencies compared with last years second quarter.  
Selling, general and administrative expense was $159.8 million for the December quarter, compared with $153.8 million for the prior year quarter and $161.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.  SG&A expense included a reduction of $2.7 million ($1.9 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share), due to factoring an account receivable that the Company had provided for in the September 2005 quarter.  SG&A expense also included the effect of adopting Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.123(R), Share-Based Payment, which increased expense by $2.9 million ($2.1 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share).
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%.  This tax rate is consistent with prior guidance, but higher than the 27.0% rate in the prior year quarter, primarily due to changes in the mix of earnings by country.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented, We were very pleased with our financial results for the December quarter.  The mobile phone and consumer markets were very strong and had a significant impact on our revenue growth and profit improvement.  In these markets, our growth was partially driven by our new products and design wins at the leading manufacturers.   In the Americas, we were pleased with our growth in the distribution and medical electronics markets.  Our growth in automotive was primarily due to the introduction of new products.
Slark continued, Our restructuring efforts are moving forward.  We were pleased with the 40 basis point sequential improvement in gross profit margin, despite a difficult raw material cost environment.  A considerable number of our management initiatives are devoted to reducing manufacturing overhead and improving margins on an individual product basis.  While a portion of the gross margin improvement was due to increased revenue, especially in our higher profit markets, we believe our internal efforts are working and contributed to this improvement.
Cash and marketable securities were $419.8 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $423.2 million at September 30, 2005 and $412.0 million at December 31, 2004.  As described below, during the December quarter the Company spent $45.0 million to repurchase its common stock.
Orders and Backlog
Orders for the second quarter were a record $703.4 million, an increase of 15.7% over the prior year December quarter, and an increase of 1.5% sequentially from the quarter ended September 30, 2005. The Companys order backlog on December 31, 2005 was $297.5 million, compared with $285.7 million on December 31, 2004.  The December quarter backlog increased 3.3%, from $288.0 million on September 30, 2005.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the December quarter were $35.7 million, compared with $34.5 million for the same period last year.  Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $66.9 million, compared with $56.9 million for the same period last year.  Depreciation expense was $52.1 million, compared with $58.3 million for the same period last fiscal year.

Revenue for the six-months ended December 31, 2005 was $1.36 billion, an increase of 5.0% compared with the prior fiscal year.  Net income of $105.2 million, or $0.56 per share, increased 0.4% compared with last years net income of $104.7 million, or $0.55 per share.  Included in the current year results was a restructuring charge of $11.4 million ($8.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.05 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program.  For the six-months, currency translation had a minor impact on revenue, but decreased net income by $1.6 million.
March 2006 Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2006 Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2006, will be in a range of $690 to $710 million.  This represents an increase of 12% to 15% compared with last years third fiscal quarter.  The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $0.28 to $0.30.  This represents an increase of 17% to 25% compared with last years third fiscal quarter.  This forecast includes an estimated restructuring charge of $4.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or approximately $0.02 per share) related to the previously announced restructuring activity.  
The Company now expects that revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 will be in a range of $2.725 to $2.800 billion, compared with previous guidance of $2.675 to $2.750 billion.  Based on these revenue expectations, earnings per share are estimated to be in a range of $1.15 to $1.19, compared with previous guidance of $1.07 to $1.12.

Merger Agreement
     On June 30, 2006, Molex Incorporated ("Molex"), MLX Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Molex ("Purchaser"), and Woodhead Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides for the acquisition of the Company by Molex. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Shares"), in exchange for $19.25 per Share in cash (the "Offer Price"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an Offer to Purchase and a related Letter of Transmittal that will be distributed to the Company's stockholders by Purchaser and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, collectively constitute the "Offer."
     Subsequent to the successful completion of the Offer and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Molex. At the effective time of the Merger, each Share then outstanding (other than (i) treasury Shares, (ii) Shares that are owned by Molex, the Purchaser or any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Molex, or (iii) stockholders who have properly exercised dissenters' rights under the Delaware General Corporation Law) will be converted into the right to receive in the Merger the same $19.25 per Share cash Offer Price, without interest. Any uncancelled options to purchase Shares that remain outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will be entitled to an amount in cash equal to the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per Share exercise price of such option, multiplied by the number of unexercised Shares subject to the option.
     The Offer is not subject to a financing condition. The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of Shares which represents at least a majority of the outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis on the date of purchase, as well as all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, the German Act Against Restraints of Competition and any material applicable foreign statutes or regulations having expired or been terminated. The Offer is also subject to a number of other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
     As part of the Merger Agreement, the Company granted to the Purchaser an irrevocable option to purchase the number of newly-issued Shares at a per share purchase price equal to the Offer Price that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Purchaser immediately following consummation of the Offer, results in Purchaser owning 90% of the fully diluted shares (the "Top-Up Option"). However, the number of Shares subject to the Top-Up Option is limited to the number of Shares authorized and available for issuance and, in any event, the Top-Up Option cannot be exercised if such exercise would require stockholder approval under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. If the Top-Up Option is exercised by Purchaser (resulting in Purchaser owning 90% or more of the fully diluted shares), Purchaser will be able to effect a short-form merger under the Delaware General Corporation Law, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement.
 
     The Merger Agreement includes customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, Molex and the Purchaser. In addition to certain other covenants, the Company has agreed not to solicit, initiate or encourage any acquisition proposal from a third party, disclose non-public information to any third party in connection with any acquisition proposal, or engage in substantive discussions regarding any acquisition proposal, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
     The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Molex and the Company, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including a termination by the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal in circumstances permitted by the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to pay Molex a termination fee of $7.0 million and reimbursement of expenses of up to $2.5 million.
     The above description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference. There are representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement which were made by the parties to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in these representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Merger Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating its terms. Moreover, certain representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that is different from certain standards generally applicable to stockholders or were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Based upon the foregoing reasons, you should not rely on the representations and warranties as statements of factual information.
Additional Information
     This document is neither an offer to purchase nor solicitation of an offer to sell securities. The tender offer for the Company's outstanding shares of common stock described in this filing has not commenced. At the time the offer is commenced, the Purchaser will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the SEC, and the Company will file a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the offer. The tender offer statement (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other offer documents) and the solicitation/recommendation statement will contain important information that should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. Those materials will be made available to the Company's stockholders at no expense to them. In addition, all of those materials (and all other offer documents filed with the SEC) will be available at no charge on the SEC's website: www.sec.gov.
     On June 30, 2006, Molex and the Company issued a joint press release, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, relating to the Merger Agreement. The press release is incorporated herein by this reference.

Notice to Investors
:
     This announcement is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. The tender offer for the outstanding shares of Woodhead Industries common stock described in this press release has not commenced. At the time the offer is commenced a wholly-owned subsidiary of Molex will file a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and Woodhead will file a solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the offer. The tender offer statement (including an offer to purchase, a related letter of transmittal and other offer documents) and the solicitation/recommendation statement will contain important information that should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the tender offer. Those materials will be made available to Woodhead stockholders at no expense to them. In addition, all of those materials (and all other offer documents filed with the SEC) will be available at no charge on the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.
     Statements in this press release regarding the proposed acquisition of Woodhead, the expected timetable for completing the transaction, future financial and operating results, benefits and synergies of the transaction, future opportunities for the combined company and any other statements about managements' future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on management's beliefs, certain assumptions and current expectations. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact (including statements containing the words "believes," "will," "plans," "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions) should also be considered to be forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements, including: the ability to satisfy the merger agreement conditions and consummate the transaction, the ability of Molex to successfully integrate Woodhead's operations and employees; the ability to realize anticipated synergies and cost savings; and the other factors described in Molex's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2005, Woodhead's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2005 and their respective subsequent SEC filings. Molex and Woodhead disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this document.

Item 8.01
Other Events
     The Company has become aware of certain media articles that do not accurately describe certain aspects of the option misdating previously disclosed in the Company's August 2, 2006 press release. The executive stock options described in the press release, over the twelve fiscal years reviewed, were found to have been misdated in a number of instances to dates either before or after the date the options were approved by the Compensation Committee. Further, the option misdating was not the result of clerical error and the executive officer who was responsible for the misdating has been reassigned. Investors should rely on the Company's August 2, 2006 press release for information regarding this matter, which press release was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on August 2, 2006, and is incorporated herein by reference. The Company assumes no responsibility for, and undertakes no obligation to correct or update, inaccurate media reports regarding this or other matters except to the extent required by law.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On January 8, 2007, Molex Incorporated issued a press release announcing preliminary estimates of second quarter 2007 results. A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. This information and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Neil Lefort Senior Vice President (630) 527-4344
Lisle, IL, USA  January 08, 2007  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today announced preliminary results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2006.
Although the Company has not finalized its financial results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2006, revenue for the second quarter is now estimated to be in a range of $830 to $840 million. The previous outlook for the second quarter, which was provided on October 19, 2006, was for revenue in a range of $830 to $850 million. The Company now estimates that earnings per share for the second quarter will be in a range of $0.34 to $0.37. The previous outlook for the second quarter was for earnings per share in a range of $0.39 to $0.43.
The reduction in earnings per share is due to lower than expected gross margin. This primarily occurred in the mobile phone business, a result of lower sales and higher price erosion, as well as an external demand shift within that market. This demand shift resulted in a greater portion of sales by the Company into lower content and less profitable mobile phone devices. In addition, the Company increased inventory reserves as a result of reduced customer demand and because some customers delayed taking deliveries in the later part of the second quarter.
New orders slowed during the second quarter and are now estimated to be in a range of $770 to $780 million. Future visibility in the current demand environment is complicated by uncertainty over the level of customer inventory adjustments, as well as general concerns regarding global economic growth in calendar 2007. In addition, the Company's short lead-time on customer orders makes forecasting difficult. For these reasons, we do not believe that at this time we can continue to provide an outlook for revenue or earnings per share beyond the second quarter. However, given the lower order rate in the second quarter, the Company now expects that its financial results for the 2007 fiscal year will be below its previous outlook given October 19, 2006.
The Company's second quarter results are scheduled to be announced at approximately 3:00 p.m., Central Time on Thursday, January 18. A conference call will be held at 4:00 p.m., Central Time on Thursday, January 18 to discuss the second quarter results.
Internet users will be able to access the web-cast live and in replay in the "Investors" section of the Company's website at .

Forward-Looking Statements
The above estimates are based on preliminary information about the second quarter of 2007. Although the quarter is now completed, the Company is still in the early stages of its standard financial reporting closing process. As a result, as the Company completes its closing process, actual results could differ from those preliminary estimates. Statements in this release that are not historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with the operation of our business, including the risk that customer demand will decrease either temporarily or permanently, whether due to the Company's actions or the demand for the Company's products, and that the Company may not be able to respond through cost reductions in a timely and effective manner; price cutting, new product introductions and other actions by our competitors; fluctuations in the costs of raw materials that the Company is not able to pass through to customers because of existing contracts or market factors; the challenges attendant to plant closings and restructurings, including the difficulty of predicting plant closing and relocation costs, the difficulty of commencing or increasing production at existing facilities, and the reactions of customers, governmental units, employees and other groups; the risks associated with the integration of the Woodhead acquisition; the challenges attendant to plant construction; and the ability to realize cost savings from restructuring activities, as well as difficulty implementing the transition to a Market-Focused Global Organization. Other risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molex's documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Item 1A of its Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006 and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. This release speaks only as of its date and Molex disclaims any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise.
Molex Incorporated is a 68-year-old manufacturer of electronic components, including electrical and fiber optic interconnection products and systems, switches and integrated products, with 54 plants in 18 countries throughout the world. Molex is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (MOLX and MOLXA) in the United States and on the London Stock Exchange. The Company's voting common stock (MOLX) is included in the S&P 500 Index.

Overview
     As disclosed in our press release of January 18, 2007 (the "January Press Release"), we have been considering revising our previously issued financial statements to reflect evolving understanding of the views of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the qualitative aspects of stock option misdating. On January 26, 2007, management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors (the "Board") determined that we should amend our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 to reflect the restatement of the consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures for the fiscal years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 and for each of the quarters in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, and that we should amend our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2006. Accordingly, the financial statements and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued or filed by us relating to prior periods should not be relied upon pending completion of the restatements. Our Audit Committee has discussed these matters with Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm.
     Our decision to restate our consolidated financial statements was based on the results of an internal inquiry and independent investigation into our past stock option granting practices. In an August 2, 2006 press release (the "August Press Release"), we announced that we undertook a voluntary internal review of our past practices related to grants of stock options. As a result of this preliminary review, our Board formed a Special Committee of independent directors to commence an investigation of our stock option granting practices for the period 1995 through 2006.
     In the August Press Release, we announced that both we and the Special Committee concluded that the dates of stock option and restricted stock grants to executive officers and other employees in a number of instances differed from the dates such grants were approved by the appropriate Board committee such that the price on the approval date was higher than the price on the stated grant date. The Special Committee concluded that no stock options granted to outside directors were misdated. The executive officer that the Special Committee determined was responsible for the misdating was removed from his position as an executive officer and has subsequently retired.
     We provided in the August Press Release the aggregate unrecorded non-cash expense relating to misdated executive officer grants. We also stated that for grants to other employees (non-executive officers) we and the Special Committee concluded that it was impracticable to determine the actual measurement dates of the grants, but that even if all such dates were determinable there would not be a material understatement of expense. The analysis of the grants to employees relied on in this determination included a range of potential measurement dates determined by reviewing the dates on available documentation such as final spreadsheets listing the employees and the number of shares to be granted to such employees, e-mails, and other correspondence.
     We announced in the August Press Release that our current executive officers agreed to repay their portion of the $685,000 in total gains realized by them as a result of the misdating and also agreed to increase the exercise prices of their unexercised options so that there would be no future gain due to misdating of grants, all of which has occurred. We further announced in the August Press Release that we and the Special Committee concluded that the stock option misdating did not result in a material misstatement to our financial statements and no change to previously issued financial statements was required under generally accepted accounting principles.
 
     Following our August Press Release, the SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant issued a letter on September 19, 2006 providing guidance regarding the proper accounting for various historical stock option granting practices. In light of this guidance, and an informal request from the SEC, we undertook an effort to determine or estimate appropriate measurement dates of the misdated stock options granted to employees, other than executive officers, in order to calculate an understatement of expense relating to such options, rather than relying on a range of potential measurement dates for determining the understatement of expense.
     Based on this analysis, we and the Special Committee continue to believe that the stock option misdating did not result in a quantitatively material misstatement to our financial statements; however, due to evolving understanding of the views of the staff of the SEC relating to the qualitative aspects of this issue, we are making the restatement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to record the following:
Share-Based Compensation
     The effect of recognizing additional share-based compensation expense resulting from the misdated grants is as follows (in thousands):
Other Adjustments
     In addition, as disclosed in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, we corrected certain other errors during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, which were immaterial to the fiscal 2005 and prior years' financial statements. In connection with the restatement, we will also correct these errors in the respective fiscal years.
Summary
     The following shows the shared-based compensation adjustments, the other adjustments, and the related tax effects of all adjustments for the fiscal years 2002 to 2006. The increase (decrease) in net income for each type of adjustment is as follows (in thousands):
 
     The effect that these adjustments had on diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years 2002 to 2006 is as follows:
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
     This current report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the SEC's and the United States Attorney's review of our stock option granting practices, the timing of the amended filing, and the impact of the restatement on us and our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated, including those stated in Item 1A "Risk Factors" of our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference and in other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC. The statements made herein are made only as of the date of this report. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
Exhibit 3.1(ii)
 
 
 
     The registered office of the Corporation shall be located in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.
SECTION 1. REGISTERED OFFICE.
     The Corporation may also have offices at such other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.
SECTION 2. OTHER OFFICES.
     Meetings of stockholders may be held at such place, if any, as may be designated by the Board of Directors or officers calling such meetings.
SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETING.
     The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held on a weekday on such date as the Board of Directors may determine, and shall be held at a time and place to be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. If the election of directors shall not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting of the stockholders as soon thereafter as the Board of Directors determines is reasonably convenient.
SECTION 2. ANNUAL MEETING.
     Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3. SPECIAL MEETINGS.
     A notice stating the date, time and place (if any) of the meeting, and in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat not less than 10 or more than 60 days prior thereto, except as otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.
SECTION 4. NOTICE.
     Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 4 shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation and shall also be deemed revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by a form of electronic transmission in accordance with these Bylaws shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by another form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. For
 
purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
     Any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation may be given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at such address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholders by written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice as set forth in this Section 4 shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
     Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
     When a meeting is adjourned, notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place (if any) thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, if the adjournment is for not more than 30 days, and if no new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact only such business, which might have been transacted at the original meeting as originally notified.
SECTION 5. ADJOURNED MEETINGS.
     The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Whether or not such quorum is present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, only such business which may have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be transacted. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or pursuant to any other regulation applicable to the Corporation or its stockholders, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of shares of capital stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any questions brought before such meeting (other than the election of directors). Except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or any other series or class of stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, at all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, a plurality of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors.
SECTION 6. QUORUM.
     Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, including the rights of any holder of Preferred Stock, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.
SECTION 7. VOTING.
 
     Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date.
     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be not more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (ii) in the case of any other action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), shall be not more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 8. FIXING OF RECORD DATE.
     
SECTION 9. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.
     (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request that the Board of Directors fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such written notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise within ten days after the date on which such written notice is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date after the expiration of such ten day time period on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8 or this Section 9, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
     (b) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 9 and applicable law, to the Corporation of written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and un-revoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 9 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     (c) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days after the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 9, a valid written consent or valid written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section 9 and applicable law, and not revoked.
     
SECTION 10. STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS PROPOSALS.
     
(a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
          Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 10 and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 10. In order for business to be properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder, such business, as determined by the chairman of the meeting, must be a proper subject under Delaware corporate law.
(1) Nominations and Business Proposals.
          For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 10, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal place of business of the Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however that in the event the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought
(2) Notice to Corporation.

          Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by these Bylaws shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal place of business of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(3) Increase in Number of Directors.
     
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders.
          Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 10, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 10.
(1) Nominations of Directors.
          Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been set forth as the purpose(s) of the special meeting in the Corporation's notice of the special meeting. Nominations by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders if a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal place of business of the Corporation not earlier than the 90th day prior to the special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to the special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at the meeting. Stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as director if elected), and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, the name and address of such stockholder and of such beneficial owner, and the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of records by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.
(2) Notice to Corporation.
     
(c) General.
          The Secretary shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10. The Secretary shall make any such determination and shall notify the interested stockholder of such determination (including the reasons for any determination that the interested stockholder's nomination or proposal was not made in compliance with this Section 10) within fifteen days after the Corporation's receipt of the stockholder's notice required by this Section 10. If the Secretary determines that such nomination or proposal is not in compliance with this Section 10, the interested stockholder shall have until the later of the expiration of the applicable notice period or five days after receipt by such stockholder of any such notice declaring that such
(1) Acceptance of Nominations and Proposals.
 
stockholder's nomination or proposal was not made in compliance with this Section 10 to rectify any deficiency cited in such notice and to resubmit such stockholder's nomination or proposal to the Secretary at the principal place of business of the Corporation. Any resubmitted nomination or proposal shall contain only such nominations or proposals as were submitted to the Corporation in such stockholder's notice which did not comply with this Section 10. The Secretary shall determine whether any such resubmitted nomination or proposal is in compliance with this Section 10, and shall notify the interested stockholder of such determination (including the reasons for any determination that the interested stockholder's resubmitted nomination or proposal was not made in compliance with this Section 10), within five additional days of the Corporation's receipt of such stockholder's resubmitted nomination or proposal.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 10. Nothing in this Section 10 shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provision of the Certificate of Incorporation.
(2) Compliance with Exchange Act.
          For purposes of this Section 10, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
(3) Definitions.
     The Secretary shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 11 or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
SECTION 11. LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE.
     The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
SECTION 12. INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS.

The Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes of directors, known as Class I, Class II and Class III, with the term of office of one Class expiring each year. Each Class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, successors to the Class of directors whose term expires at that meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third annual meeting following their election and until their successors shall be elected and qualified, subject to prior death, retirement, resignation or removal.
(a) Election and Tenure of Directors.
     The board shall comprise a number of not less than six nor more than 15 directors as determined by resolution of the Board of Directors. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the Class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of such director's current term or his or prior death, retirement, resignation or removal, and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board of Directors among the three Classes of directors such that the Classes are as nearly equal as possible, and each director so elected shall hold office for the same term as the other members of the Class to which the director is assigned. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board of Directors shall shorten the term of an incumbent director.
(b) Number of Directors.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation or the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to the provision of the Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes unless expressly provided by such terms.
(c) Directors Elected by Preferred Stockholders.
     Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled solely by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a quorum, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.
SECTION 2. VACANCIES.
 
     A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held without other notice than this by-law, immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders at the place thereof; provided that if such annual meeting is held by remote communication, a notice of the regular meeting of the Board of Directors specifying the place thereof shall be provided to each director in accordance with Section 5 of this Article III.

Item 2.05
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
.
     On June 18, 2007, Molex Incorporated ("Molex") announced a plan to implement restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve return on invested capital in connection with the new global organization to be launched on July 1, 2007. Molex currently estimates that the total pre-tax charge related to this restructuring effort will be $100 to $125 million over the fiscal year 2007 fourth quarter and fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Molex expects that the restructuring charge will be made up of headcount reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures. Molex expects to take an estimated pre-tax charge of approximately $20 million in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter related primarily to severance and other employee-related costs. At this time, Molex is not able to make a determination of the estimated amount or range of amounts to be incurred in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 for each major type of cost and the charges and future cash expenditures associated therewith.
     Molex's analysis is preliminary and therefore is subject to change. Molex plans to announce further details in its next earnings release scheduled for Wednesday, August 1, 2007, and as initiatives are finalized. The timing of the implementation of these initiatives and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors including Molex's efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transition. Molex currently expects to complete implementation of these actions by the end of fiscal year 2009.

Lisle, IL, USA  June 18, 2007  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today announced a revised outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30, 2007, and restructuring charges in connection with the introduction of the new global reorganization.
As the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter ending June 30, 2007 nears completion, revenue for the quarter is now estimated to be in a range of $780 to $810 million. The previous outlook for the quarter provided on April 19, 2007 was for revenue in a range of $810 to $850 million. Earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter are estimated to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.34, excluding the impact of the expected restructuring charges mentioned below. The previous outlook for the quarter was for earnings per share in a range of $0.34 to $0.38.
The reduction in estimated revenue and earnings per share is primarily due to lower than expected demand in the mobile phone, consumer and data business, including lingering inventory corrections at some larger customers.
Restructuring Charges and Related Cost Savings
In its release dated April 19, 2007, the Company announced that it was in the process of identifying significant opportunities to reduce costs and to improve return on invested capital in connection with the new global organization to be launched on July 1, 2007. The Company currently estimates that the total pretax charge related to head-count reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures will be $100 to $125 million. The Company expects an estimated pretax charge of approximately $20 million in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, primarily related to severance and other employee-related costs. The remaining pretax charges of $80 to $105 million will be incurred in the next two fiscal years. Additional details relating to these charges will be provided in the next scheduled earnings release (see below).
The Company expects that when fully implemented, the annualized pretax savings from the restructuring activities will be in a range of $75 to $100 million. Additional details relating to the cost savings will also be provided in the next earnings release.
 
The fiscal 2007 fourth quarter results are scheduled to be announced at approximately 3:00 p.m. CST on Wednesday, August 1. A conference call will be held at 10:15 a.m. CST on Thursday, August 2. The conference call will be held as part of the Annual Analysts meeting in Chicago, which is scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m. CST on Thursday, August 2.
Access to the conference call and the segments of the Analysts meeting relating to the restructuring charges and related cost savings will be available to those not attending. Further details will be provided.
Forward-Looking Statements
The above estimates are based on preliminary information about the fourth quarter of 2007. As a result, as the Company completes its closing process, actual results could differ from those preliminary estimates. Statements in this release that are not historical are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with the operation of our business, including the risk that customer demand will decrease either temporarily or permanently, whether due to the Company's actions or the demand for the Company's products, and that the Company may not be able to respond through cost reductions in a timely and effective manner; price cutting, new product introductions and other actions by our competitors; fluctuations in the costs of raw materials that the Company is not able to pass through to customers because of existing contracts or market factors; the challenges attendant to plant closings and restructurings, including the difficulty of predicting plant closing and relocation costs, the difficulty of commencing or increasing production at existing facilities, and the reactions of customers, governmental units, employees and other groups; and the ability to realize cost savings from restructuring activities, as well as difficulty implementing the transition to a New Global Organization. Other risks and uncertainties are set forth in Molex's documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Item 1A of its
Form 10-K/A
for the year ended June 30, 2006. This release speaks only as of its date and Molex disclaims any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements or to provide any updates regarding information contained in this release resulting from new information, future events or otherwise.

Item 2.05
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
.
     On June 18, 2007, Molex Incorporated ("Molex") filed a current report on Form 8-K regarding its multi-year plan to implement restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve return on invested capital in connection with the new global organization launched on July 1, 2007. At that time, Molex was unable to make a determination of the estimated amount or ranges of amounts to be incurred for each major type of cost and the charges and future cash expenditures associated therewith as required by Item 2.05 of Form 8-K. Molex undertook to announce further details as initiatives are finalized.
     Molex is filing this Form 8-K/A to amend the June 18, 2007 Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein. Molex estimates that the total pre-tax charge related to this restructuring effort will be $100 to $125 million over the fiscal year 2007 fourth quarter and fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Molex expects that the restructuring charge will be made up of headcount reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures.
     Molex recorded $36.9 million of the total pretax charge in the fiscal year 2007 fourth quarter, including $28.2 million for employee termination benefit costs and $8.7 million for manufacturing asset impairments or write-offs.
     During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, Molex will focus on reducing operating costs consistent with its goal of improving return on invested capital. Molex estimates that approximately $35 million of the remaining estimated pretax restructuring charge of $65 to $85 million will be recorded in fiscal 2008, with the remainder in fiscal 2009. Molex expects that when fully implemented by the close of fiscal year 2009, the annualized pretax savings from the restructuring activities will be in the range of $75 to $100 million. Molex estimates pretax savings of $20 to $25 million in fiscal 2008.
     Molex's analysis is preliminary and therefore is subject to change. The timing of the implementation of these initiatives and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors including Molex's efforts to achieve a phased and efficient transition. Molex expects to announce further exit and disposal costs and intends to file amendments to the report once it is able to make good faith determinations of the estimated costs and future cash expenditures associated with its multi-year restructuring initiatives.

Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, IL, USA  August 1, 2007  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2007 fourth fiscal quarter and announced a 50% increase in the cash dividend.
2007 Fourth Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $791.8 million, an increase of 1.0% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies declined 0.9% as currency translation increased revenue by $14.9 million, compared with last year's June quarter. Revenue for the quarter included $54.7 million from Woodhead Industries, which the Company acquired on August 10, 2006.
Net income for the June quarter was $32.7 million, or $0.18 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a charge of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after-tax or approximately $0.16 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. Also included in the current quarter was the favorable resolution of an income tax contingency and other items amounting to approximately $0.04 per share. This compares with net income of $70.5 million, or $0.38 per share in the prior year quarter that included restructuring charges of $10.7 million ($7.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.04 per share). Currency translation increased net income by $0.3 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented, "The June quarter operating results were within our revised outlook announced on June 18, 2007. When compared with last year's June quarter, revenue increased in the industrial, automotive, medical and military portions of our business. However, the June quarter was significantly impacted by difficulties in the mobile phone market where revenue declined 15% from the March quarter, and by 30% compared to last year's June quarter. While the majority of these declines are customer specific, the overall mobile phone market is currently being driven by growth in entry level phones having lower functionality and connector content. We believe this is the result of initial demand in the developing economies, and that these large markets will eventually transition to more sophisticated higher content devices. Revenue in both the consumer and data markets declined by 5  6% compared to last year's June quarter, due in part to concerns regarding consumer spending as well as lingering inventory corrections at some larger customers."
 
Gross profit margin for the June quarter was 30.0%, compared with 31.1% in the March quarter, and 33.0% in last year's June quarter. The reduction from the March quarter was primarily due to revenue declines in several of the Company's more profitable markets, resulting in higher fixed manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue. SG&A expense for the June quarter was 20.4% of revenue, compared with 20.1% in the March quarter, and 19.6% in last year's June quarter. The effective tax rate for the June quarter was 26.2%, reflecting a reduction in income tax expense due to the favorable resolution of an income tax contingency in the amount of $4.6 million, a change in mix of earnings in countries with tax rates that are lower than the U.S. tax rate, offset by various tax adjustments.
2007 Fiscal Full Year Results
Revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2007 was $3.27 billion, an increase of 14.1% compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies increased 11.8% as currency translation increased revenue by $60.2 million compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue for the year included $202.5 million from Woodhead Industries, which the Company acquired on August 10, 2006. Revenue increased 9% in the consumer market, 3% in the telecom market (including both infrastructure and mobile), and 6% in the data market. Revenue in the automotive market increased 11%. Revenue in the industrial market, including the acquisition of Woodhead Industries increased 100% and by 16% excluding Woodhead.
Net income was $240.8 million, or $1.30 per share. Included in the fiscal year results was a restructuring charge of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after-tax or approximately $0.16 per share). Also included in the fiscal year were favorable tax and other adjustments of approximately $0.04 per share. Currency translation increased net income by $1.2 million when compared to the prior year. These results compare with net income of $236.1 million, or $1.26 per share for the prior year. Included in the prior year results was a restructuring charge of $26.4 million ($19.2 million after-tax or $0.10 per share).
Orders and Backlog
Orders for the June quarter were $775.8 million, compared with $785.2 million in the prior year June quarter, and $782.8 million in the March quarter. The Company's order backlog on June 30, 2007 was $332.5 million, compared with $370.0 million in the prior year June quarter, and $345.9 million in the March quarter. Woodhead Industries contributed bookings of $58.6 million to the current quarter, and had a backlog of $24.3 million on June 30, 2007.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the June quarter were $37.4 million, compared with $35.7 million in the prior year June quarter. Capital expenditures for the June quarter were $77.4 million, compared with $82.9 million in the prior year June quarter. Depreciation expense was $59.9 million, compared with $53.7 million in the prior year June quarter.
Cash and Working Capital
During the June quarter total cash increased by $87.8 million to $460.9 million. Accounts receivable declined by $7.2 million and the level of accounts receivable outstanding improved by 2 days. Inventory declined by $22.7 million with a reduction in days outstanding of 2 days.
 
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Company also announced that its Board of Directors has approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.1125 per share, an increase of 50 percent from the previous cash dividend of $0.075 per share. The new regular quarterly cash dividend will be payable on October 25, 2007 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2007 for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board. Martin P. Slark commented, "The cash dividend has been increased by 200% since the beginning of fiscal 2006. The current increase reflects our current strong financial position, and the expected improvement in return on invested capital from our reorganization and restructuring actions."
Stock Buyback Actions
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 415,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 130,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $14.9 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of common stock through September 30, 2007. As of June 30, 2007, approximately $15.2 million was remaining under this authorization.
Reorganization and Restructuring Update
The Company has transitioned to a new global organization structure effective July 1, 2007. The new structure realigns the company into five product-focused global divisions and one global sales and marketing division and replaces the previous geographic based regional organization. When the Company announced this initiative on August 2, 2006, it mentioned a major benefit would be to leverage its global resources and streamline operations. As a result, significant opportunities to reduce cost and to improve return on invested capital have been identified and are now being implemented.
On June 18, 2007 the Company announced a restructuring plan that is expected to result in pre-tax charges of $100 to $125 million. The plan includes head-count reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures. As previously mentioned, the Company recorded $36.9 million of the total pretax charge in the June 2007 quarter, including $28.2 million for employee termination costs and $8.7 million for manufacturing asset impairments or write-offs.
During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, the Company will focus on reducing operating costs consistent with its goal of improving return on invested capital. In a global industry with short order lead-times and an extremely diversified range in both number and complexity of products, the manufacturing component of restructuring must be approached sequentially to avoid any potential impact to delivery performance. This phased approach is reflected in the Company's financial guidance for fiscal 2008. Based on the current implementation schedule, the Company estimates that approximately $35 million of the remaining estimated pretax restructuring charge of $65 to $85 million will be recorded in fiscal 2008, with the remainder in fiscal 2009. The Company expects that when fully implemented by the close of fiscal year 2009, the annualized pretax savings from the restructuring activities will be in the range of $75 to $100 million. The Company estimates pretax savings of $20 to $25 million in fiscal 2008.
 
2008 Fiscal Year and First Fiscal Quarter Outlook
The Company believes it has a strong competitive position in its major markets which is being enhanced by the global reorganization. In addition, the Company's current financial position is strong and supportive of new product development and strategic acquisitions.
Although the direction of the global economy is uncertain, the Company believes that it is useful to provide its initial outlook for the coming year. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, revenue is estimated in a range of $3.25 to $3.35 billion. The Company expects that earnings per share will be in a range of $1.25 to $1.33. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.15 per share. The Company's revenue estimate is based upon the current level of orders and the expectation of low single-digit growth in the connector market. The outlook has been tempered by signs of a potential contraction in consumer spending primarily in the developed economies. The estimate also includes a reduction of approximately $70 million in revenue compared with fiscal year 2007 from non-core businesses the Company has exited.
The Company expects that revenue for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2007, will be in a range of $770 to $800 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.25 to $0.29. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.01 per share.
The Company estimates that capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 will be in a range of $280 to $310 million. Capital expenditures were $296.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements in this release that are not historical are forward-looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those stated. Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and include, among others, the discussion under "Reorganization and Restructuring Update" and "2008 Fiscal Year and First Fiscal Quarter Outlook", as well as statements regarding the integration of, and potential synergies from the Woodhead acquisition, customer demand and inventory levels and future growth expectations. These risks and uncertainties include those associated with the operation of our business, including the risk that customer demand will decrease either temporarily or permanently, whether due to the Company's actions or the demand for the Company's products, and that the Company may not be able to respond through cost reductions in a timely and effective manner; price cutting, new product introductions and other actions by our competitors; fluctuations in the costs of raw materials that the Company is not able to pass through to customers because of existing contracts or market factors; the challenges attendant to plant closings and restructurings, including the difficulty of predicting plant closing and relocation costs, the difficulty of commencing or increasing production at existing facilities, and the reactions of customers, governmental units, employees and other groups; the risks associated with the integration of the Woodhead acquisition; the challenges attendant to plant construction; and the ability to realize cost savings from restructuring activities, as well as difficulty implementing the transition to a Market-Focused Global Organization.

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Neil Lefort    Senior Vice President (630) 527-4344          
Lisle, IL, USA  October 18, 2007  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2008 first fiscal quarter.
2008 First Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 was $792.6 million, a decrease of 4.5% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies declined 6.4% as currency translation increased revenue by $15.9 million, compared with last year's September quarter. Revenue increased $0.8 million over the June 2007 quarter.
Net income for the September quarter was $53.3 million, or $0.29 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a pretax charge of $2.6 million or approximately $0.01 per share, relating to the previously announced restructuring program. Currency translation increased net income by $1.5 million when compared to the prior year quarter.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented on the quarter, "While revenue was down from last year, we were encouraged by the sequential booking and revenue improvement. When compared to the June quarter, revenue in the mobile phone market increased 9.7%, while revenue in the consumer and data markets increased by 7.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Total orders increased 4.6% sequentially, with the first positive book to bill ratio since the previous September quarter."
Gross profit margin for the September quarter was 29.8%, compared with 30.0% in the June quarter, and 32.5% in the prior year September quarter. The reduction from last year was primarily due to the lower revenue resulting in a higher fixed manufacturing ratio, as well as higher price erosion and increased material costs for purchases of copper, plastics, and gold.
SG&A expense for the September quarter was 20.3% of revenue, compared with 20.4% in the June quarter, and 20.0% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the September quarter was 30.0%.
 
Orders and Backlog
Orders for the September quarter were $811.5 million, compared with $864.6 million in the prior year September quarter, and $775.8 million in the June quarter. The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2007 was $353.3 million, compared with $425.5 million in the prior year September quarter, and $332.5 million in the June quarter.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the September quarter were $39.9 million, compared with $40.7 million in the prior year September quarter. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $49.1 million, compared with $75.6 million in the prior year September quarter and $77.4 million in the June quarter. Depreciation expense was $58.6 million, compared with $56.4 million in the prior year September quarter and $59.9 million in the June quarter.
As mentioned in our press release on April 19, 2007, one major goal of the new product-focused organization structure is to improve return on capital by streamlining operations and leveraging existing global resources. As part of this initiative, the product divisions have identified reductions in capital expenditures. The Company now estimates that capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008 will be in a range of $260 to $275 million compared with a previous estimate of $280 to $310 million.
Cash and Working Capital
During the September quarter total cash decreased by $13.6 million to $447.3 million. This includes $60.5 million used to repurchase stock. Accounts receivable and inventory days remained at approximately the same levels as in the June quarter.
Restructuring Update
On June 18, 2007, the Company announced a restructuring plan through the end of fiscal year 2009, which includes total estimated pretax charges of $100 to $125 million, and when fully completed estimated annualized pretax savings of $75 to $100 million. The plan includes headcount reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures, which should result in lower operating costs and improved return on invested capital. As previously reported, $36.9 million in restructuring charges were recorded in the June quarter and the Company estimates that fiscal 2008 restructuring charges will approximate $35.0 million, with the remainder to be recognized in fiscal 2009.
The restructuring actions to date include a reduction of 540 employees primarily in North America and Europe. To better align capacity, a manufacturing plant in Ireland and an engineering center in Germany are being closed. In addition, distribution centers in China and Japan were consolidated, while four manufacturing plants in China were combined into two larger facilities. Also, in connection with the integration of Woodhead, the closure of a facility in Wales was announced.

Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1,940,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 500,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $60.5 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2008, and approximately $139.5 million remains under this authorization.
Second Quarter Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2007, will be in a range of $800 to $840 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.29 to $0.33. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.02 per share.

In addition, on November 13, 2007, the Board adopted a resolution permitting the issuance of uncertificated securities. The amendments were made to Sections 1 and 4 of Article V of the Bylaws. Molex's Bylaws were amended and restated in order to ensure that the Company's listed securities are eligible for participation in the Direct Registration System.
The foregoing summary description of the amendments to Molex's Bylaws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended and restated Bylaws, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1(ii) and incorporated herein by reference.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
 
 
 
     The registered office of the Corporation shall be located in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.
SECTION 1. REGISTERED OFFICE.
     The Corporation may also have offices at such other places, both within and without the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require.
SECTION 2. OTHER OFFICES.
     Meetings of stockholders may be held at such place, if any, as may be designated by the Board of Directors or officers calling such meetings.
SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETING.
     The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held on a weekday on such date as the Board of Directors may determine, and shall be held at a time and place to be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. If the election of directors shall not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting of the stockholders as soon thereafter as the Board of Directors determines is reasonably convenient.
SECTION 2. ANNUAL MEETING.
     Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3. SPECIAL MEETINGS.
     A notice stating the date, time and place (if any) of the meeting, and in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat not less than 10 or more than 60 days prior thereto, except as otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.
SECTION 4. NOTICE.
     Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 4 shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation and shall also be deemed revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by a form of electronic transmission in accordance with these Bylaws shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by another form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. For
 
purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
     Any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation may be given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at such address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholders by written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice as set forth in this Section 4 shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
     Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
     When a meeting is adjourned, notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place (if any) thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, if the adjournment is for not more than 30 days, and if no new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact only such business, which might have been transacted at the original meeting as originally notified.
SECTION 5. ADJOURNED MEETINGS.
     The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Whether or not such quorum is present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, only such business which may have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be transacted. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or pursuant to any other regulation applicable to the Corporation or its stockholders, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of shares of capital stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any questions brought before such meeting (other than the election of directors). Except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or any other series or class of stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, at all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, a plurality of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors.
SECTION 6. QUORUM.
     Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, including the rights of any holder of Preferred Stock, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.
SECTION 7. VOTING.
 
     Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date.
     In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be not more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (ii) in the case of any other action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), shall be not more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 8. FIXING OF RECORD DATE.
     
SECTION 9. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.
     (a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request that the Board of Directors fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such written notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise within ten days after the date on which such written notice is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date after the expiration of such ten day time period on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8 or this Section 9, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
     (b) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 9 and applicable law, to the Corporation of written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and un-revoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 9 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
     (c) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days after the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 9, a valid written consent or valid written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section 9 and applicable law, and not revoked.
     
SECTION 10. STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS PROPOSALS.
     (a) 
Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
          Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 10 and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 10. In order for business to be properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder, such business, as determined by the chairman of the meeting, must be a proper subject under Delaware corporate law.
(1) Nominations and Business Proposals.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Contact: Neil Lefort Senior Vice President (630) 527-4344
Lisle, IL, USA  January 23, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2008 second fiscal quarter.
2008 Second Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was $841.6 million, an increase of 0.5% over the same period last fiscal year and 6.2% over the September 2007 quarter. Revenue in local currencies declined 4.0% as currency translation increased revenue by $37.5 million compared with last year's December quarter.
When compared with the September quarter, revenue in the telecom communications market increased 12.4%, primarily due to a 14.3% increase in revenue for mobile phones. Revenue in the data and consumer markets increased 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively. Revenue in the automotive market increased 3.8%, primarily due to gains in Japan and Europe. Revenue in the industrial market declined 2.3%.
Net income for the December quarter was $59.2 million, or $0.33 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a pretax charge of $7.3 million, or approximately $0.02 per share, relating to the previously announced restructuring program. Earnings per share were $0.36 in the prior year December quarter and $0.29 in the September 2007 quarter.
Gross profit margin for the December quarter was 30.1%, compared with 29.8% in the September quarter and 30.9% in the prior year December quarter. The reduction from last year was due primarily to price erosion and the higher material purchase costs for gold. The average market price of gold for the quarter increased 28% when compared with the prior year quarter. The Company continues to benefit from a gold hedge covering close to one-half of fiscal 2008 usage.
SG&A expense for the December quarter was 19.7% of revenue, compared with 20.3% in the September quarter, and 20.0% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the December quarter was 30.0%.
 
Orders for the December quarter were $858.9 million, increasing 10.3% compared with the prior year quarter and 5.8% sequentially. Order growth in telecom was excellent, again due to the improving mobile phone market. The Company's order backlog on December 31, 2007 was $374.7 million, compared with $375.9 million in the prior year December quarter, and $353.3 million in the September quarter.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented on the quarter, "Revenue reached a record level and earnings per share was at the high end of our outlook. We were also encouraged that sequential trends remained positive with a 1.02 book to bill ratio for the quarter. Gross profit margin improved when compared with the September quarter, and our cost reduction program is on track. We have now completed two quarters under the new product division organization and the results to date are encouraging. The product divisions have already demonstrated the potential under this structure to reduce capital spending and control headcount and other resources. In addition, the global sales and marketing organization has successfully transitioned without any adverse impact to customers or our traditional order patterns. As the product divisions work to execute their new global strategies, we expect the benefits of the new organization to increasingly contribute to our financial results."
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the December quarter were $43.1 million, compared with $40.4 million in the prior year December quarter. Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $53.3 million, compared with $80.2 million in the prior year December quarter and $49.1 million in the September quarter. Capital expenditures for the first two quarters of fiscal 2008 were $102.4 million, or 6.3% of revenue, compared to $155.8 million, or 9.3% of revenue in the prior year period. This reduction is consistent with the Company's goal of increasing asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth.
Depreciation expense was $60.3 million, compared with $58.3 million in the prior year December quarter and $58.6 million in the September quarter.
Cash and Working Capital
During the December quarter, total cash declined by $4.7 million to $442.6 million. This includes $51.2 million used to repurchase stock. Total accounts receivable and inventory days remained at approximately the same levels as in the September quarter.
Six-Month Results
Revenue for the six-months ended December 31, 2007 was $1.63 billion, a decrease of 2.0% compared with the prior fiscal year. During this period currency translation increased revenue by $53.3 million. Net income of $112.5 million, or $0.61 per share, declined 21.2% compared with last year's net income of $142.7 million, or $0.77 per share. Included in the current fiscal results was a pretax charge of $9.9 million, or approximately $0.04 per share, relating to the restructuring program.

Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 400,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $51.2 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2008, and approximately $88.2 million remains under this authorization.
Third Quarter Outlook
The Company entered the third quarter with a very strong balance sheet, and its cost reduction initiatives proceeding as planned. Business levels improved during the second quarter, especially outside the United States. We are benefiting from our considerable global presence both in demand and stronger currency translation. While forecasting the short-term environment is difficult given the global economic uncertainty, we believe that aggregate inventory within the supply chain is at reasonable levels. While the Company has not seen a reduction in demand, lead-times and visibility remain short term. The Company believes that its cost reduction initiatives, as well as the progress shown in lowering capital investment, are prudent steps, especially during times of economic uncertainty.
The Company expects that revenue for the third fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2008, will be in a range of $820 to $860 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.31 to $0.35. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.02 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, IL, USA  April 22, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2008 third fiscal quarter.
2008 Third Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was $822.3 million, an increase of 1.9% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies declined 4.4% as currency translation increased revenue by $51.1 million compared with last year's March quarter.
When compared with the same period last fiscal year, revenue in the telecom market increased 5.7%. Revenue in the data and consumer electronics markets increased 8.7% and 1.7% respectively. Revenue in the automotive market increased 5.4%, due to gains in Japan and Europe. Revenue in the industrial market declined 18.4%, the result of divesting certain low margin businesses and a delay in shipments related to a seasonal project.
Net income for the March quarter was $50.3 million, or $0.28 per share. Included in the current quarter was an after-tax charge of $4.9 million ($0.03 per share) relating to the previously announced restructuring program and an income tax charge of $10.5 million ($0.06 per share) due to foreign tax credit adjustments resulting from the recent filing of our fiscal 2007 tax return. Without these charges, earnings per share would have been $0.37 per share. Earnings per share were $0.33 (including a restructuring charge of $0.02) in the December 2007 quarter and $0.35 in the prior year March quarter.
Gross profit margin for the March quarter was 30.9%, improving to the highest level since the prior year March quarter when gross profit margin was 31.1%. SG&A expense for the March quarter was 20.4% of revenue, compared with 19.7% in the December quarter, and 20.1% in the prior year quarter. The effective tax rate for the March quarter was 42.1%, reflecting the income tax charge mentioned previously.
 
Orders for the March quarter were $898.0 million, increasing 14.7% compared with the prior year quarter and 4.5% sequentially. Orders have increased sequentially in each of the three quarters during the current fiscal year. Year over year order growth was strong in all major markets, with the exception of the industrial market which was flat. Compared with the prior year quarter, order growth in the telecom market was very strong increasing by 35%. Order growth was strong in the data and consumer electronics markets which increased 13.0% and 11.1% respectively. Order growth in the medical electronics market was 14.1%. While the medical electronics market currently represents only 2.7% of total revenue, the Company expects significant long term growth in this market coincidental with the aging population demographics.
The Company's order backlog on March 31, 2008 increased 33.2% to $461.0 million, compared with $346.0 million in the prior year March quarter. Backlog as of December 2007 was $375.0 million.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman, commented on the third quarter, "We were very pleased with our operating results, especially the sequential improvement in gross profit margin. Since the transition to the new global product division and sales and marketing organization, we have made steady progress in improving operating efficiencies. We have also reduced capital spending as a percentage of revenue by 210 basis points during the current fiscal year. In the March quarter our restructuring activities advanced significantly with the completion of our plant expansion in China."
"Demand trends were very positive with record new orders and a 1.09 book to bill ratio. We believe this demonstrates the enhanced ability of our global sales and marketing organization to generate additional business including design wins in our customers new products."
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the March quarter were $41.7 million, compared with $40.6 million in the prior year March quarter. Capital expenditures for the March quarter were $61.0 million, compared with $63.6 million in the prior year March quarter. Capital expenditures for the first three quarters of fiscal 2008 were 6.7% of revenue, compared with 8.8% of revenue in the prior year period. This reduction is consistent with the Company's goal of increasing asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth.
Depreciation expense was $61.8 million, compared with $58.3 million in the prior year March quarter and $60.3 million in the December quarter.
Nine-Month Results
Revenue for the nine-months ended March 31, 2008 was $2.46 billion, a decrease of 0.7% compared with the prior fiscal year. During the current fiscal year, currency translation increased revenue by $104.4 million. Net income of $162.8 million, or $0.89 per share declined 21.7% compared with last year's net income of $208.0 million, or $1.12 per share. Included in the current fiscal year results is an after-tax charge of $11.1 million ($0.06 per share) relating to the restructuring program and an income tax charge of $10.5 million ($0.06 per share) as a result of foreign tax credit adjustments resulting from the recent filing of our fiscal 2007 tax return.

Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2,085,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 325,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $54.4 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2008, and approximately $33.8 million remains under this authorization.
Fourth Quarter Outlook
Martin P. Slark commented, "We entered the fourth quarter with considerable momentum. New orders in the third quarter were a record. We believe we have significant competitive advantage by combining our new product technologies with our global presence, both in access to stronger overseas demand and through the diversification of a global customer base. The recently implemented product division based organization is also providing opportunities to expand both sales and profits. In addition, the restructuring initiatives are moving forward, with increases in operating margins expected in fourth quarter."
As a result, the Company anticipates a sequential improvement in revenue and earnings per share for the fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2008. The Company expects that revenue will be in a range of $850 to $890 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.36 to $0.40. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.03 per share.

Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, Ill, USA  August 5, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2008 fourth fiscal quarter.
2008 Fourth Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 was $871.9 million, an increase of 10.1% over the same period last fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies increased 1.9% as currency translation improved revenue by $64.9 million, compared with last year's June quarter.
Net income for the June quarter was $52.6 million, or $0.29 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a charge of $15.0 million ($9.9 million after-tax or approximately $0.06 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program and an income tax charge of $10.9 million ($0.06 per share) due to foreign tax credit adjustments. This compares with net income of $32.7 million, or $0.18 per share in the prior year quarter that included restructuring charges of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after-tax or approximately $0.16 per share). Without these two charges, earnings per share in the June quarter would have been $0.41 per share, a 20.6% increase when compared with $0.34 in the prior year quarter.
Martin P. Slark, CEO and Vice-Chairman commented, "The June quarter revenue and operating results were within our previous outlook. We were pleased with the 10.1% increase in revenue to a record level, although currency translation was a contributing factor. We continue to benefit from our strong presence in Asia/Pacific and our focus on new product development. The sequential increase in revenue of 6%, when compared with the March quarter was also encouraging, and less impacted by currency."
When compared with last year's June quarter, revenue increased in the telecom and data markets by 28% and 10% respectively. This strong growth is the result of our leadership in providing complete solutions utilizing high speed, optical, and micro-miniature advanced integration technologies. Consumer electronics increased 17%, the result of global demand for digital entertainment products, as well as increased penetration at several fast growing customers. Revenue in the automotive market increased 1%, reflecting a challenging environment particularly in North America, and an external strike that was ultimately settled during the quarter. Revenue in the industrial market was down 10%, impacted by actions taken to divest certain low margin businesses, as well as slower economic activity in the United States and Europe. Revenue grew 18% in medical electronics and 12% in military/aerospace. While these markets represent a small portion of current revenue, we believe they present excellent growth opportunities.
 
Gross profit margin for the June quarter was 31.0%, compared with 30.9% in the March quarter, and 30.0% in last year's June quarter. SG&A expense for the June quarter was 19.6% of revenue, compared with 20.4% in the March quarter and 20.4% in last year's June quarter. The effective tax rate for the June quarter was 42.2%, reflecting the income tax charge previously mentioned.
Orders and Backlog
Orders were $858.0 million, up 10.6% when compared with $775.8 million in the prior year June quarter. This is a reasonable order rate and consistent with the estimated revenue growth for the September quarter. The order backlog on June 30, 2008 was $436.5 million, compared with $332.5 million in the prior year June quarter, and $460.7 million in the March quarter.
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the June quarter were $39.0 million, compared with $37.4 million in the prior year June quarter. Capital expenditures for the June quarter were $71.2 million, compared with $77.4 million in the prior year June quarter.
2008 Fiscal Full Year Results
Revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 was $3.33 billion, an increase of 1.9% compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies declined 3.3% as currency translation increased revenue by $169.3 million, compared with the prior fiscal year.
Net income was $215.4 million, or $1.19 per share, as compared with net income for the prior year of $240.8 million, or $1.30 per share. Included in the fiscal year results were restructuring charges of $31.2 million ($21.0 million after-tax or $0.12 per share) and income tax charges related to changes in prior years' foreign tax credits of $17.2 million ($0.09 per share). Included in the prior year results was a restructuring charge of $36.9 million ($30.3 million after-tax or $0.16 per share).
Capital expenditures for the fiscal year were $234.6 million, or 7.0% of revenue, down significantly from the prior year level of $296.9 million, or 9.1% of sales. This reduction is consistent with the Company's goal of increasing asset efficiency by lowering the incremental investment required to drive future growth.
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Board of Directors has approved an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.1525 per share, an increase of 36% from the previous cash dividend of $0.1125 per share. The new regular quarterly cash dividend will be payable on October 24, 2008 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2008, for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board. This is the fifth increase in the last five years and represents a CAGR over the period of 44%.
 
Stock Repurchase Actions and New Authorization
During the quarter, we repurchased 1,054,500 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 175,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $33.4 million. The Board of Directors had previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common stock through June 30, 2008. During the fiscal year, we purchased an aggregate amount of $199.6 million of Common Stock.
The Board of Directors has again authorized the repurchase of Molex shares on a discretionary basis. The authorization allows the repurchase of the outstanding Common Stock (MOLX) and/or Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) during the period ending June 30, 2009, up to an aggregate value of $200 million.
Restructuring Update and Increase/Extension of Program
On June 18, 2007 we announced a two-year restructuring program with the goal of reducing operating costs and capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue. The plan is proceeding on schedule. The initial estimate for total annualized pretax savings was in the range of $75 million to $100 million, and a pretax restructuring charge in a range of $100 million to $125 million.
We remain committed to achieving our operating profit goal. The cost reduction savings are as expected, however the benefit to incremental profit has been diminished by inflation and rising raw material costs. While recent trends in raw material costs have been positive, we believe it prudent to remain focused on operating cost reduction. As a result, the scope of the restructuring program will be increased. The revised estimate for annual pretax savings is $100 million to $120 million, and for a total pretax restructuring charge of $125 million to $140 million. These actions are expected to be completed early in fiscal 2010.
2009 Fiscal Year and First Fiscal Quarter Outlook
The actions taken over the last several years to strengthen our organization by transitioning to a Product Division Structure have been successfully completed. The new structure has contributed to reducing both capital deployed and operating costs in relationship to revenue. The new organization has also enhanced our strength in the developing markets, and our ability to deploy our technical and selling resources on a more global basis, when compared with the previous regional structure. As a result, and supported by our financial strength, we are able to significantly increase the cash dividend and to renew the stock repurchase authorization. Our financial strength is also supportive of new product development and strategic acquisitions.
While our visibility is limited, thus making it difficult to forecast the first half of calendar 2009, we believe it useful to provide investors with our initial view for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009. We also think it prudent to temper our internal forecast by considering, to the extent possible, concerns in the external economic environment, and have done so in the following outlook.
We believe that current demand and connector inventories within the supply chain support a positive revenue outlook, and that our cost reduction and pricing initiatives will contribute to growth in earnings per share in an estimated range of 11% to 17%.
 
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, revenue is estimated in a range of $3.50 to $3.60 billion. The mid-point of this estimate represents growth of 6.7% over fiscal year 2008. GAAP earnings per share are estimated in a range of $1.33 to $1.43. These estimates include a restructuring charge in a range of $50 to $65 million, with a mid-point impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.22 per share. Without these charges, earnings per share are estimated in a range of $1.55 to $1.65. These results assume an effective tax rate of 32.0%.
During FY09 the focus of the organization will be on increasing market share, the introduction of new products, and the reduction of operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, the pricing initiatives introduced during the 2008 fourth fiscal quarter and effective July 1, 2008, will be continued during the fiscal year.
Revenue for the first fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2008, is estimated in a range of $860 to $880 million. The mid-point of this estimate represents growth of 9.8% when compared with the prior year September quarter. GAAP earnings per share are estimated in a range of $0.35 to $0.40. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.01 per share.
Capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 are expected to be in a range of $230 to $250 million, or approximately 6.75% of the mid-point estimated revenue.

ITEM: Cost Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
     On June 18, 2007, Molex Incorporated ("Molex") filed a current report on Form 8-K regarding its multi-year plan to implement restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve return on invested capital in connection with the new global organization launched on July 1, 2007. Molex is filing this Form 8-K/A to amend the June 18, 2007 Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein.
     Molex's initial estimates were that the total pre-tax charge related to this restructuring effort would be $100 to $125 million over the fiscal year 2007 fourth quarter and fiscal years 2008 and 2009, and that the restructuring charge would be made up of headcount reductions, realignment of manufacturing capacity and certain plant closures. The plan is proceeding on schedule and we remain committed to achieving our operating profit goal. The cost reduction savings are as expected, however the benefit to incremental profit has been diminished by inflation and rising raw material costs. While recent trends in raw material costs have been positive, we believe it prudent to remain focused on operating cost reduction. As a result, the scope of the restructuring program will be increased. The revised estimate for annual pretax savings is $100 million to $120 million, and for a total pretax restructuring charge of $125 million to $140 million. These actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2010.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Contact: Neil Lefort Senior Vice President (630) 527-4344
Lisle, Ill., USA  October 28, 2008  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2009 first fiscal quarter.
2009 First Fiscal Quarter Results
Operating results were similar to the revised outlook provided on October 2, 2008. Revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 was $839.0 million, an increase of 5.9% over the same period last fiscal year. Currency translation increased revenue by $44.0 million. Revenue using constant exchange rates was flat compared with last year's September quarter.
When compared with last year's September quarter, revenue increased in the telecom and data markets by 28% and 5% respectively. Revenue in the consumer and medical markets both increased by 5%. Revenue in the automotive and industrial markets declined by 11% and 9% respectively, reflecting the many economic issues impacting these markets.
Gross profit margin for the September quarter was 29.7%, compared with 29.8% in the prior year September quarter. SG&A expense for the September quarter was 19.8% of revenue, compared with 20.3% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in the SG&A expense ratio reflects a lower cost structure resulting from the restructuring initiative which began in fiscal 2007. The effective tax rate for the September quarter was 32.0%, compared with 30.0% in the prior year quarter.
Net income for the September quarter was $44.3 million, or $0.25 per share. Included in the current quarter results was a pretax charge of $21.8 million ($15.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.09 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. This compares with net income of $53.3 million, or $0.29 per share in the prior year quarter that included restructuring charges of $2.6 million ($1.5 million after-tax or approximately $0.01 per share).
Orders and Backlog
Orders for the September quarter were $795.9 million, compared with $811.5 million in the prior year September quarter. The Company's order backlog on September 30, 2008 was $385.5 million, compared with $353.3 million in the prior year September quarter.
 
Research and Development and Capital Spending
Research and development expenditures for the September quarter were $43.5 million, compared with $39.9 million in the prior year September quarter. Capital expenditures for the September quarter were $45.3 million, compared with $49.1 million in the prior year September quarter. The Company has already implemented plans to reduce capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 significantly below the low end of the range of its initial estimate of $230 million, and will make further reductions should economic conditions not improve
.
Restructuring Update
On August 5, 2008, the Company announced an increase in its restructuring plan through the end of fiscal year 2010, which now includes total estimated pretax charges of $125 to $140 million, and when fully completed estimated annualized pretax savings of $100 to $120 million. Cumulative restructuring charges of $89.9 million were recorded through September 30, 2008, and the Company estimates that the remaining restructuring charges in fiscal 2009 will approximate $45.0 million, with the remaining $5 million to be recognized in fiscal 2010.
The restructuring charge of $21.8 million recorded in the September quarter was primarily focused on reducing both the automotive and industrial manufacturing footprint and cost structure. This charge includes closures of a European manufacturing plant and a European design center supplying the automotive market, and two North American manufacturing plants supplying the industrial market. Also, on October 2 we announced the closure of a manufacturing plant in Japan.
nd
Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 732,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and 900,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) at a total cost of $38.8 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009, and approximately $161.2 million remains under this authorization.
Outlook
The Company expects that revenue for the second fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2008, will be in a range of $750 to $800 million, and earnings per share will be in a range of $0.18 to $0.22. These estimates include a restructuring charge of approximately $0.04 per share.
Based on current global economic conditions, the Company has limited visibility to forecast revenue beyond one fiscal quarter, and as a result, will provide guidance for one quarter only at this time. The Company currently believes that operating results for fiscal 2009 will be below the range provided in its outlook on August 5, 2008, and cautions investors not to rely on prior estimates.

Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, Ill., USA  January 27, 2009  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2009 second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008.
2009 Second Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the second fiscal quarter was similar to the revised outlook provided on December 8, 2008. The Company continues to be impacted by the global slowdown in all markets, and compounded by customers reducing their levels of component inventory. Revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 was $666.7 million, a decrease of 20.8% from the same period last fiscal year, and 20.5% from the September 2008 quarter. Revenue in local currencies fell 20.9% as currency translation increased revenue by $1.1 million, compared with last year's December quarter.
Gross profit margin was 26.4%, compared with 30.1% in the prior year December quarter and 29.7% in the September 2008 quarter. These decreases were primarily due to lower absorption of manufacturing overhead costs caused by lower production levels. SG&A expense declined $21.1 million from last year's December quarter, and $21.7 million from the September 2008 quarter, due to significant cost reduction and restructuring activities.
Net loss was $87.2 million, or ($0.50) per share. Included in the quarter results was a pretax restructuring charge of $39.8 million ($29.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.17 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. Also included was a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $93.1 million (both pretax and after-tax), or approximately $0.53 per share, related to a previous acquisition in the transportation division. The December quarter compares with net income of $59.2 million, or $0.33 per share in the prior year quarter that included a pretax restructuring charge of $7.3 million, or approximately $0.02 per share after-tax. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 6.1%, due to the goodwill impairment charge that does not result in a tax benefit. Excluding goodwill, the tax provision reflects an annualized rate of 34%, as compared with the September quarter rate of 32%.
During the quarter, significant actions were taken to reduce headcount and lower the cost of employee benefits. These included changes in retirement medical benefits, a reduction in planned contributions to the profit sharing trust and a reduction in the planned incentive bonus payout. The one-time cost reductions relating to these changes increased pretax profit in the December quarter by $14.2 million and are incremental to the previously announced restructuring program. In addition, manufacturing employees worked reduced hours in the plants most impacted by the economic slowdown. Due to the sudden strengthening of the U.S. dollar at the end of October, we also recognized an exchange gain that increased pretax profit in the December quarter by $14.3 million. The combined effect of the benefit changes and exchange gain was $0.11 per share.
 
Orders for the December quarter were $562.2 million, down 34.5% compared with the prior year quarter and down 29.4% sequentially. The Company's order backlog on December 31, 2008 was $285.3 million, compared with $374.7 million in the prior year December quarter and $385.5 million in the September quarter.
Capital expenditures for the December quarter were $51.3 million, compared with $53.3 million in the prior year December quarter and included expenditures related to plant construction as part of the Company's restructuring program. Capital expenditures for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 were $96.6 million or 6.4% of revenue, compared with $102.4 million or 6.3% of revenue in the prior year period. As a result of lower demand, the capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2009 was significantly reduced and is now estimated in a range of $170 to $190 million. This compares with fiscal 2008 spending of $234.6 million.
Spending for research and development was $41.2 million, compared with $43.1 million in the prior year quarter. Product development expenditures were modestly lowered in reaction to the decline in new product development. During the first half of fiscal 2009, the Company introduced 113 new products, and is committed to providing the investment necessary to remain a technology leader in the industry.
Cash flow from operations was $100 million for the December quarter and $190 million for the six months ended December 31, 2008. Cash and marketable securities was $458 million at the end of the quarter.
Restructuring Update
The restructuring charge of $39.8 million recorded in the December quarter was primarily related to severance for headcount reductions across all divisions, and the costs associated with a plant closure in Japan and in our European automotive business. The automotive business also plans to close additional plants in Europe and Asia Pacific while the industrial business plans to consolidate two Canadian facilities and close a U.S. warehouse.
The Company increased the scope of the restructuring program and now estimates a total pretax charge through the end of fiscal year 2010 of approximately $220 million, compared with a previous estimate of $125 to $140 million. Cumulative restructuring charges of $129.7 million were recorded through December 31, 2008, and the Company estimates that the additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2009 will approximate $55 million, with the remaining $35 million to be recognized in fiscal 2010. The expected annualized cost savings of the restructuring program have increased to approximately $200 million.
Acquisition Update
During the quarter, the Company completed a small acquisition in Japan. With this acquisition the Micro Products Division acquired specific advanced technologies, which should enhance their existing competitive advantage in markets including consumer electronics, mobile handsets and medical devices.
Six-Month Results
Revenue for the six-months ended December 31, 2008 was $1.5 billion, a decline of 7.9% compared with the prior fiscal year. During this period currency translation increased revenue by $45.1 million. Net loss of $42.9 million, or ($0.24) per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $61.6 million ($45.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.26 per share), and a pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $93.1 million, or $0.53 per share.

Stock Buyback
During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock (MOLX) and 875,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) at a total cost of $37.5 million. The Board of Directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of common stock through June 30, 2009, and approximately $123.7 million remains under this authorization.
Outlook
The uncertain global economy is making it difficult for our customers to provide specific timing as to when orders could begin to recover. In addition, lead-times have further compressed, resulting in 60-70% of revenue being ordered in the same quarter that it is shipped. As a result, the Company considers it prudent to provide a wide range in its outlook, and estimates revenue in the range of $500 to $570 million for the March quarter. We also believe that orders should improve during the quarter, after customer inventory levels adjust to lower production levels and as customers begin production in the facilities temporarily closed in December. Should this occur, we would expect revenue to improve later in the March quarter, but this was not factored into our current outlook. Given the wide range of potential revenue and the difficulty in quantifying the impact of product mix on overall margin, the Company will not provide an outlook for earnings per share at this time.
The Company's cost reduction strategy includes both permanent and short term initiatives. The restructuring program, which began in April 2007, includes all actions to permanently reduce costs and the manufacturing footprint. The short term actions include the previously mentioned reductions in work schedules and employee compensation and benefits. These short term actions are in reaction to the severe economic downturn and revenue levels temporarily below what the Company considers as normal. We believe that this approach enables the Company to generate a positive cash flow from operations and maintain its current cash dividend, while retaining the level of resources and skills necessary to lead when the global economy recovers.
In the December quarter, actions were finalized to further reduce operating cost beginning in the March quarter. Effective February 1, 2009, salaries will be reduced for officers and salaried employees in the U.S., as well as in most international operations.

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
     (b) Dave B. Root, Executive Vice President and President of Molex Incorporated's ("Molex") Commercial Products Division was planning to retire in 2010, and has now decided to accelerate his retirement as a result of the consolidation of our Transportation Products Division and Commercial Products Division as part of our global restructuring plan. As a result of such consolidation, effective March 31, 2009, David B. Root stepped down as President of the Commercial Products Division of Molex Incorporated ("Molex"). Mr. Root will remain employed by Molex until his retirement on December 31, 2009 (the "Separation Date"), during which time he will remain available for consultation with Molex. Effective April 1, 2009 James E. Fleischhacker has taken over as President of the newly consolidated division which will continue to be known as the Commercial Products Division.
     (e) On April 2, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Molex approved a Separation Agreement in connection with Mr. Root's retirement. Molex and Mr. Root entered into the Separation Agreement on April 6, 2009.
     Under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Root will be entitled to receive the following material pay and benefits: (i) continued base annual salary less applicable tax withholdings and current benefits until the Separation Date; (ii) a severance payment in the monthly amount of $19,734.72, less applicable U.S. tax withholdings during the period of 54 months beginning on the first day of the month that is at least six months after the Separation Date; (iii) participation in the Molex Retiree Medical Plan; and (iv) employment benefits associated with his current expatriate assignment in Singapore, which will terminate as of June 30, 2009. The Separation Agreement also provides that any non-vested or unexercised stock options (or any other non-vested equity awards) will be cancelled effective on the Separation Date.
     Molex is not obligated to make payments due under the Separation Agreement unless Mr. Root complies with the confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition and non-disparagement covenants set forth in the Separation Agreement following his retirement.
     This description is qualified in its entirety by the Separation Agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (d) Exhibits.
     10.1 Separation Agreement between David B. Root and Molex Incorporated dated April 6, 2009.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Date: April 6, 2009
 

Exhibit 10.1
     This Separation Agreement (the "Agreement") is between David B. Root for and on behalf of himself, his spouse, family, heirs, assigns, legal representatives, agents and attorneys (jointly, "Root"), and Molex Incorporated and all of its subsidiaries, successors, divisions, affiliates, directors, past and present officers, benefit plans, benefit plan administrators, trustees, fiduciaries, insurers, employees and agents (jointly, the "Employer").
1. .
Agreement
     If Root signs and does not revoke this Agreement, he will receive:
2. .
Separation Benefits
 
 
      Root agrees that during the Separation Period, he shall comply with the following provisions:
3. .
Root's Obligations
 
     In exchange for the benefits set forth in this Agreement to which Root would not otherwise be entitled, he is waiving and releasing all known or unknown claims and causes of action he has or may have, as of the day he signs this Agreement, against the Employer arising out of or relating to his employment, including his separation from employment. The claims Root is releasing include, but are not limited to, any and all allegations that the Employer:
4. 
General Release
.
 
 
     Excluded from the General Release above are any claims or rights which cannot be waived by law. Also excluded from the General Release is Root's right to file a charge with an administrative agency (such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) or participate in any agency investigation. Root is, however, waiving his right to recover money in connection with such a charge or investigation. Root is also waiving his right to recover money in connection with a charge filed by any other individual or by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any other federal or state agency.
5. 
Exclusions From General Release
.
     A "covenant not to sue" is a legal term which means Root promises not to file a lawsuit in court. It is different from the General Release of claims set forth above. Besides waiving and releasing the claims covered by the General Release, Root further agrees never to sue, either alone or, directly or indirectly, in conjunction with any other individual entity, or person, the Employer or its predecessors, successors, parents, joint ventures, subsidiaries, partners and assigns, as well as its past and present officers, directors, employees, shareholders, owners, benefit plans, benefit plan administrators, trustees, fiduciaries, counsel, insurers, attorneys and agents, in any forum for any reason, including but not limited to claims, laws or theories covered by the General Release, and Root represents and warrants that he has not filed any such claim to date. Notwithstanding this Covenant Not To Sue, Root may bring a claim against the Employer to enforce this Agreement or to challenge the validity of the General Release under the ADEA, as amended.
6. 
Covenant Not To Sue
.
     If Root sues the Employer in violation of this Agreement:
 
(As indicated above, it would not violate any part of this Agreement to sue the Employer to enforce this Agreement, or to challenge the validity of the general Release under the ADEA.)
     Root also agrees that he:
7. 
Employee Acknowledgments
.
     Root agrees that he will not disclose, directly or indirectly, the terms of this Agreement and shall keep such terms confidential, including but not limited to the fact and amount(s) of the payments set forth in this Agreement, except that he may make necessary disclosures to his immediate family, attorney(s), tax advisor(s) or as may be required by law; provided, however, if this Agreement is required to be filed with the US Securities Exchange Commission and thereby becomes public information, such nondisclosure provision shall not apply. The benefits set forth in this Agreement are contingent on Root keeping the confidentiality promise contained in this Section. Root also acknowledges the Employer's right to enforce this confidentiality provision in any court of competent jurisdiction. Root further agree that if he breaches this confidentiality provision, the Employer will be irreparably harmed as a matter of law and will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief, plus its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing this provision.
8. 
Confidentiality
.
     The fact and terms of this Agreement are not an admission by the Employer of liability or other wrongdoing under any law.
9. 
Non-Admissions
.
     Root agrees that:
10. 
Additional Employee Acknowledgments
.
 
     After Root signs this Agreement, he will have seven (7) days to revoke it if he changes his mind. If Root wants to revoke the Agreement, he should deliver a written revocation to Ana G. Rodriguez within seven (7) days after he signed it. If Root revokes this Agreement, he will not receive the benefits described in Section 2. However, his revocation of this Agreement will not affect his eligibility, or that of his spouse, to elect continued medical or dental coverage under COBRA, but he will be required to pay the same premiums as any other participant, and the coverage will be limited to the period provided by COBRA. Root's revocation will not affect his entitlement to any benefit to which he is otherwise entitled under the terms of any benefit plan or applicable law.
11. .
Revocation
      If any part of this Agreement is found to be invalid, the rest of the Agreement will be enforceable.
12. .
Severability
      This is the entire Agreement between Root and the Employer regarding the separation of his employment with the Employer and resolves all matters, claims and disputes between Root and the Employer. Other than what is provided in this Agreement, Root is not entitled to receive any other benefits and the Employer is not obligated to provide any other benefits.
13. .
Complete Agreement
 
     This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.
14. .
Counterparts
     This Agreement shall be effective on the eighth day after Root signs this Agreement if he does not revoke it before then.
15. .

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Neil Lefort Senior Vice President (630) 527-4344
Lisle, Ill., USA  April 21, 2009  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2009 third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2009.
2009 Third Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 of $505.5 million was at the lower end of the range estimated in the release dated January 27, 2009. Revenue decreased 38.5% from the same period last fiscal year, and 24.2% from the December 2008 quarter. Revenue continued to be impacted by the global slowdown, made worse by customer initiatives to reduce their inventory. Revenue in local currencies fell 37.1% as currency translation decreased revenue by $12.0 million, compared with last year's March quarter.
Gross profit margin was 18.5%, compared with 30.9% in the prior year March quarter, and 26.4% in the December 2008 quarter. The decline in gross profit margin reflected lower absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from significantly lower production volume. SG&A expense declined $28.6 million from last year's March quarter and $5.5 million from the December 2008 quarter, due to the cost reduction and restructuring programs.
Net loss was $58.6 million, or ($0.34) per share. Included in the quarter results was a pretax restructuring charge of $44.3 million ($34.0 million after-tax or approximately $0.20 per share), relating to the previously announced restructuring program. The March quarter compares with net income of $50.3 million, or $0.28 per share in the prior year quarter that included a pretax restructuring charge of $6.4 million, or approximately $0.03 per share after-tax. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3%.
Orders for the March quarter were $475 million, down 47% compared with the prior year quarter and down 16% from the December 2008 quarter. The Company's order backlog on March 31, 2009 was $251 million, compared with $461 million at March 31, 2008 and $285 million at December 31, 2008. Orders improved each month during the quarter, and the book to bill ratio was positive for the month of March.
Capital expenditures for the March 2009 quarter were $31.1 million, compared with $61.0 million in the prior year March quarter and $51.3 million in the December 2008 quarter. Capital spending during the March quarter was primarily for production tooling related to new product development. Capital expenditures for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 were $127.7 million or 6.3% of revenue, and included expenditures related to plant construction as part of the restructuring program. This compares with $163.4 million or 6.7% of revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2008. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were significantly reduced to maximize cash flow in this difficult economy and are now estimated in a range of $165 to $185 million for the full year. This compares with fiscal 2008 spending of $234.6 million.
 
Research and development expense was $34.9 million, compared with $41.7 million in the prior year quarter due primarily to salary reductions and cost containment activities. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 the Company released 158 new products. During the March quarter new design activity improved significantly, and consistent with the company's goal of remaining a technology leader in the industry, spending for R&D is expected to increase in subsequent quarters.
Cash flow from operations was $121.3 million for the March quarter and $311.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2009. Cash and marketable securities was $505.9 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of $48.2 million from December 31, 2008.
Martin P. Slark, CEO, commented on the quarter, "We believe that the revenue and orders for the quarter were below the level of current market demand, a result of inventory reductions within the supply chain. When combined with our initiatives to reduce our own inventory, manufacturing volume was below the level required to break-even on an operating basis. We have been aggressive in our response to the business environment, including making salary reductions for officers and salaried employees in the U.S. as well as in most international operations. In addition, we have lowered headcount by 25% over the last two quarters."
Slark continued, "During the quarter we also successfully managed our cash flow. For example, inventory declined by 19.5% sequentially, while accounts receivable declined by 26.0% sequentially and returned to a normal level of 75 days sales outstanding. Capital expenditures were tightly controlled and reduced to the lowest level in several years. These initiatives improved our cash position providing us with additional security during these tough times."
Restructuring Update
The restructuring charge of $44.3 million recorded in the March quarter was primarily related to severance for headcount reductions and the costs associated with plant closures. Since the end of the quarter the Company announced the closure of a manufacturing plant in Japan.
The total estimated pretax restructuring charge through the end of fiscal year 2010 has increased to a range of $240 to $250 million. Cumulative restructuring charges were $174 million through March 31, 2009, and the Company estimates that the additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2009 will approximate $50 million, with the remaining $20 to 25 million to be recognized in fiscal 2010. The expected annualized cost savings from the restructuring program is approximately $200 million.
Nine-Month Results
Revenue for the nine-months ended March 31, 2009 was $2.0 billion, a decline of 18.1% compared with the prior fiscal year. During this period, currency translation increased revenue by $33.1 million. Net loss of $101.5 million, or ($0.58) per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $105.9 million ($79.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.45 per share), and a pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $93.1 million, or $0.53 per share.

Outlook
The improved order rate in the month of March has continued through the date of this release, and we anticipate that both revenue and orders for the June quarter will be above the March quarter. While orders appear to have bottomed in the March quarter, future visibility remains limited. As a result, the Company considers it prudent to provide a wide range in its outlook, and estimates revenue in the range of $525 to $575 million for the June quarter.
The Company's cost reduction strategy includes both permanent and short term initiatives. The permanent cost initiatives should enhance financial leverage in the recovery. The short term actions are in response to the economic downturn and lower than normal revenue levels. We believe that this approach maximizes cash flow from operations, while retaining the level of resources and skills necessary to improve our competitive position when the global economy improves.

The obligation of the Applicable Borrower to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by any Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, such Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of any Issuing Bank; that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse any Issuing Bank from liability to the Applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the applicable Issuing
Obligations Absolute
provided
 
Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.
          (g) . The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Applicable Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether such Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve such Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

          (h) . If any Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that such Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans; that, if any Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous or current Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and
 
including the date such amount is made available to the Applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (x) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (y) the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) or (ii) in the case of the Applicable Borrower, (A) the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (B) the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Borrowing, including any applicable Mandatory Costs Rate (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency).

          SECTION 2.08. . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type, in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Company may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type and denominated in the Foreign Currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Company.
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
 
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
          (e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (unless such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, in which case such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration commencing on the last day of such Interest Period). Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration.

Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments
          (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
provided
          (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments
provided
 
delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
          (d) On up to two occasions, the Company may, from time to time, at its option, seek to increase the total Commitments by up to an aggregate amount of $75,000,000 (resulting in maximum total Commitments of $270,000,000) upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such increase and shall be delivered at a time when no Default has occurred and is continuing. After delivery of such notice, the Administrative Agent or the Company, in consultation with the Administrative Agent, may offer the increase (which may be declined by any Lender in its sole discretion) in the total Commitments on either a ratable basis to the Lenders or on a non pro-rata basis to one or more Lenders and/or to other Lenders or entities reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Company. No increase in the total Commitments shall become effective until the existing or new Lenders extending such incremental Commitment amount and the Company shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a document in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent pursuant to which any such existing Lender states the amount of its Commitment increase, any such new Lender states its Commitment amount and agrees to assume and accept the obligations and rights of a Lender hereunder and the Company accepts such incremental Commitments. The Lenders (new or existing) shall accept an assignment from the existing Lenders, and the existing Lenders shall make an assignment to the new or existing Lender accepting a new or increased Commitment, of a direct or participation interest in each then outstanding Loan and Letter of Credit such that, after giving effect thereto, all Revolving Credit Exposure hereunder is held ratably by the Lenders in proportion to their respective Commitments. Assignments pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made in exchange for the principal amount assigned plus accrued and unpaid interest and commitment and letter of credit fees. The Company shall make any payments under Section 2.16 resulting from such assignments. Any such increase of the total Commitments shall be subject to receipt by the Administrative Agent from the Company of such supplemental opinions, resolutions, certificates and other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
          SECTION 2.10. . (a) Each Applicable Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each of its Revolving Loans on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Company shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt

          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from
 
each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima
facie
provided
          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
          (f) If at any time the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of the Lenders exceeds the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) immediately prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess. To the extent that, after the prepayment of all Loans an excess of the Revolving Credit Exposure over the aggregate Commitments still exists, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) promptly cash collateralize the Letters of Credit in the manner described in Section 2.06(j) in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
          (g) The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate LC Exposure and the Dollar Equivalent of each Loan on each Exchange Rate Date. If at any time the sum of such amounts exceeds 105% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) immediately prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess. To the extent that, after the prepayment of all Loans an excess of the sum of such amounts over the aggregate Commitments still exists, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) promptly cash collateralize the Letters of Credit in the manner described in Section 2.06(j) in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
          SECTION 2.11. . (a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
Prepayment of Loans
 
          (b) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09(c). Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.
provided
          SECTION 2.12. . (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the difference between the Commitment of such Lender and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender (excluding its Swingline Exposure) during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day of April, July, October and January of each year (to the extent accrued during the preceding calendar quarter) and on the date on which the Commitments terminate (to the extent not previously paid), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
Fees
          (b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Company and such Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the third
 
Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
          (c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
          (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
          SECTION 2.13. . (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
Interest
          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
          (c) Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest as determined in accordance with Section 2.05.
          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
          (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, upon the final maturity thereof and upon termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
provided
          (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on Borrowings denominated in Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), (ii) interest on Borrowings denominated
 
in any other Foreign Currency for which it is required by applicable law or customary to compute interest on the basis of a year of 365 days or, if required by applicable law or customary, 366 days in a leap year, shall be computed on such basis, and (iii) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          SECTION 2.14. . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in any currency:
Alternate Rate of Interest
     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such currency shall be ineffective, (ii) such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, an ABR Borrowing or (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, as a Borrowing in respect of which the rate to apply to each Lender's applicable Loan is an interest rate equal to the sum of (1) the Applicable Rate for Eurocurrency Loans, (2) the rate notified to the Administrative Agent by such Lender as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be paid in respect of the applicable Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to such Lender of funding its applicable Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select and (3) the Mandatory Costs Rate, if any, applicable to such Lender's applicable Loan, and (iii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (if such Borrowing is requested to be made in Dollars) or shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at the rate described under (ii)(B) above.
          SECTION 2.15. . (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement compensated for by the Mandatory Cost Rate or pursuant to Section 2.21(b)) or any Issuing Bank; or
 
     (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company (or, in the case of paragraph (a), the Applicable Borrower) shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.16. . In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency
Break Funding Payments
 
Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the Applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event, which loss, cost or expense shall be an amount equal to the amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Eurocurrency Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits in the applicable currency of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurocurrency market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          SECTION 2.17. . (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Applicable Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Applicable Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes
provided
          (b) In addition, the Applicable Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
          (c) The Applicable Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Applicable Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Applicable Borrower by a Lender or Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
          (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Applicable Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Applicable Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Applicable Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall, upon the request of the Applicable Borrower, deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by such Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate.
          (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of or credit for any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by one of the Borrowers or with respect to which one of the Borrowers has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund or the amount of such credit to the Applicable Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Applicable Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that the Applicable Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority or loses the benefit of such credit. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
provided
          SECTION 2.18. . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn, Floor 7, Chicago, Illinois 60603, except payments to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
 
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of (i) principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in the currency in which such Loan is denominated, (ii) reimbursement obligations shall be made in the currency in which the Letter of Credit in respect of which such reimbursement obligation exists is denominated or (iii) any other amount due hereunder or under another Credit Document shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall at or before such time have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
          (b) So long as no Event of Default exists, all payments by any Borrower hereunder shall be applied as directed by such Borrower ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of payments then due to such parties. If at any time during the existence of an Event of Default insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders except as contemplated by Section 9.04 in respect of assignments to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such
provided
 
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (i) at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated in Dollars) and (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of an amount denominated in a Foreign Currency).
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid in any order determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
          SECTION 2.19. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay, or to cause the Applicable Borrower to pay, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the
provided
 
Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
          SECTION 2.20. .
Subsidiary Borrowers
          (a) The Company may, at any time or from time to time, designate any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Company that is a Foreign Subsidiary as a "Subsidiary Borrower" hereunder by furnishing to the Administrative Agent a Designation Letter in duplicate, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, together with the items described in paragraphs (e) and (f) of Section 4.01 relating to such Subsidiary Borrower in substantially the same form and scope as those delivered with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower designated on the date of this Agreement (or, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require if there were no such deliveries) and such other documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any such designation by the Company. Upon such designation and the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Lender thereof (which approval each Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to grant within ten (10) Business Days unless such Lender has in good faith determined that there exists a practical or legal impediment to its performance as a Lender with respect to such Foreign Subsidiary (or that it would incur any incremental expense as a result of such designation for which it would not be entitled to be compensated hereunder)), such designated Foreign Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder (with the related rights and obligations) and shall be entitled to request Revolving Loans on and subject to the terms and conditions of, and to the extent provided in, this Agreement.
          (b) So long as all Loans made to any Subsidiary Borrower and any related obligations have been paid in full, the Company may terminate the status of such Subsidiary Borrower as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Administrative Agent a Termination Letter in duplicate, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary. Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Subsidiary Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery or (ii) the obligations of the Company under the Parent Guaranty or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guaranty with respect to any such unpaid obligations.
          SECTION 2.21. . (a) For so long as any Lender is required to comply with (i) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial
Additional Reserve Costs
 
Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (ii) the requirements of the European Central Bank, in each case in respect of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans, such Lender shall be entitled to require the Applicable Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth in hereto.

     (iii) if the Company cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to Section 2.22(c), the Company shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
     (iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to Section 2.22(c), then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; or
     (v) if any Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to Section 2.22(c), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12.(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and

          In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.

     (d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, Ill., USA  August 4, 2009  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its 2009 fourth fiscal quarter and its full fiscal year 2009, both ended June 30, 2009.
2009 Fourth Fiscal Quarter Results
Revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 of $570.6 million was at the higher end of the range estimated in the release dated April 21, 2009 and increased 12.9% from the March 2009 quarter. Revenue decreased 34.6% from the prior year June quarter and fell 31.4% in local currencies as currency translation decreased revenue by $27.9 million.
Gross profit margin was 24.1%, compared with 18.5% in the March 2009 quarter, and 31.0% in the prior year June quarter. The increase in gross profit margin from the March quarter reflects the higher revenue level and cost savings from the previously announced restructuring program. The decline in gross profit margin from the prior year June quarter reflected lower absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from significantly lower production volume.
SG&A expense declined $2.4 million from the March quarter and $34.4 million from last year's June quarter, due to the cost reduction actions and additional savings from the restructuring program. Research and development expense was $39.6 million, compared with $34.9 million in the March 2009 quarter. The increase in research and development expense underscores the Company's commitment to new product development and supports the goal of remaining a technology leader in the industry. During fiscal 2009 the Company released 194 new products.
Net loss was $219.7 million or $1.27 per share for the quarter. Included in the quarter results was a pretax restructuring charge of $28.0 million ($21.1 million after-tax or $0.12 per share), relating to the restructuring program. We also recorded pretax intangible asset impairments and other charges of $17.6 million ($11.1 million after-tax or $0.07 per share) and a pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $171.0 million ($0.99 per share) for our Automation & Electrical business unit of our Custom & Electrical segment due to the impact of the recent downturn in the industrial market. The June quarter compares with net income of $52.6 million, or $0.29 per share in the prior year June quarter that included a pretax restructuring charge of $15.0 million, or approximately $0.06 per share after-tax. The effective tax rate for the quarter was (2.1%) due primarily to the impairment of goodwill which does not result in a tax benefit, additional tax contingency reserves and recording valuation allowances for certain jurisdictions with losses that may not generate realizable tax benefits.
Excluding the restructuring and impairment charges, the Company generated a non-GAAP pretax profit of $1.3 million for the June quarter. A complete reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure can be found on page 5.
 
Orders for the June quarter were $576 million, an improvement of 21% from the March 2009 quarter, but down 33% compared with the prior year June quarter. The Company's order backlog at June 30, 2009 was $253 million, compared with $436 million at June 30, 2008 and $251 million at March 31, 2009. The book-to-bill ratio was 1.01.
Capital expenditures for the June 2009 quarter were $50.3 million, compared with $31.1 million in the March 2009 quarter and $71.2 million in the prior year June quarter. Capital spending during the June quarter was primarily for equipment and production tooling related to new product development but included $14.4 million related to the restructuring program.
Cash flow from operations was $58.3 million for the June quarter and $369.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2009. Cash and marketable securities were $467.9 million at June 30, 2009, a decline of $38.0 million from March 31, 2009, though $31.1 million of cash was used to repay debt during the June 2009 quarter.
Molex Chief Executive Officer, Martin P. Slark, commented on the quarter, "We are encouraged by the improvement in business levels, especially in the month of June when both revenue and orders reached their high for the quarter. It appears that inventory reductions in our industry's supply chain are substantially complete, which should result in further improvements in our business levels during the September quarter. In addition, we have been aggressive in our response to the business environment, including reducing our headcount by 24% over the last three quarters and controlling capital expenditures for the year to the lowest level since 2003. As a result, we generated significant operating leverage during the quarter as demonstrated by the 560 basis point sequential improvement in gross profit margin."
Restructuring Update
The pretax restructuring charge of $28.0 million recorded in the June quarter was primarily related to severance costs for previously announced actions in Europe and Asia as well as an early retirement plan in Japan that was announced in April.
The cumulative pretax restructuring charges expected to be incurred through the end of fiscal year 2010 remains in a range of $240 to $250 million. Cumulative restructuring charges were $198 million through June 30, 2009, with the remainder to be recognized in fiscal 2010. The expected annual cost savings from the restructuring program remains in a range of $190 to $210 million.
Full Year Results
Revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2009 was $2.6 billion, a decline of 22.4% compared with the prior fiscal year. During the fiscal year, currency translation increased revenue by $5.2 million. Net loss of $321.3 million, or $1.84 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $131.3 million ($99.0 million after-tax or $0.57 per share), pretax intangible asset impairments and other charges of $20.2 million ($12.8 million after-tax or $0.7 per share), and a pretax and after-tax goodwill impairment charge of $264.1 million ($1.51 per share). The effective tax rate for the full year was (0.8%), due primarily to the impairment of goodwill which does not result in a tax benefit and recording valuation allowances for certain jurisdictions with losses that may not generate realizable tax benefits.
Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were $177.9 million or 6.9% of revenue, and included expenditures related to the restructuring program. This compares with $234.6 million or 7.0% of revenue for the prior fiscal year. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 were significantly reduced to match demand and to maximize cash flow in this difficult economy.

Outlook
The improved order rate during the June quarter and through July suggests that both revenue and orders for the September quarter should be above the June quarter level. However, as future visibility remains limited, the Company considers it prudent to provide a relatively wide range for its outlook, and estimates revenue in a range of $590 to $630 million for the September quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.00 to $0.06, assuming an effective tax rate of 34%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $10 million or $0.04 per share after-tax. Due to the limited visibility caused by current economic conditions, the Company will not provide full year guidance at this time.

Non-GAAP pretax profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We refer to Non-GAAP pretax profit to describe earnings excluding the items referenced above. We believe that Non-GAAP pretax profit provides useful information to investors because it provides information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business. Non-GAAP pretax profit is used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance. Non-GAAP pretax profit may be different from similar measures used by other companies.

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: Steve Martens Vice President of Investor Relations (630) 527-4344
Lisle, Ill., USA  October 27, 2009  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 that exceeded previously issued guidance.
 
Revenue for the September 2009 quarter of $674.0 million exceeded the high end of the outlook provided on September 21, 2009 of $665.0 million and increased 18% from the June 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 16%. Orders for the quarter were $724.4 million, an increase of 26% from the June 2009 quarter. Recovery in the data, consumer electronics and telecom markets exceeded expectations.
Net loss for the September 2009 quarter was $11.6 million, or $0.07 per share, compared with a net loss of $219.7 million, or $1.27 per share, for the June 2009 quarter. The range for the earnings per share outlook provided on September 21, 2009 was a loss of $0.08 to $0.12 per share.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the September 2009 quarter was $31.7 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with a net loss of $16.5 million, or $0.09 per share, in the June 2009 quarter. This result exceeded the upper end of the outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.16 per share. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded a pretax restructuring charge of $55.9 million ($38.5 million after-tax or $0.22 per share) and a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share. The tax adjustment is primarily due to the reversal of a tax benefit for a significant number of employee stock options that expired unexercised during the quarter.
 
Molex Chief Executive Officer, Martin P. Slark, commented on the quarter, "We continue to see month over month improvements in revenue and orders in virtually all of our key markets. The increase in orders of 26% from the June quarter was the second consecutive quarter of increasing orders and gives us strong momentum going into the December quarter. Order rates in two key markets, consumer electronics and data, surpassed prior year levels. As in the June quarter, we saw significant operating leverage as gross margin benefited from the increase in revenue and ongoing cost containment actions. This is strong evidence that our restructuring program is yielding the intended results. Looking forward, we are assessing the sustainability of the recovery as well as the impact of rising raw material costs and the weaker dollar."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2009:
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $680 to $720 million for the December 2009 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.11 to $0.15, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $19 million or $0.07 per share after-tax. Due to the limited visibility caused by current economic conditions, the Company will not provide full year guidance at this time.

Item 2.05
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
.
     On June 18, 2007, Molex Incorporated ("Molex") filed a current report on Form 8-K regarding its multi-year plan to implement restructuring initiatives designed to reduce costs and improve return on invested capital in connection with the new global organization launched on July 1, 2007. At that time, Molex was unable to make a determination of the estimated amount or ranges of amounts to be incurred for each major type of cost and the charges and future cash expenditures associated therewith. Molex is filing this Form 8-K/A to amend the June 18, 2007 Form 8-K to update the disclosure therein.
     Molex expects to incur total restructuring and asset impairment costs related to the restructuring of approximately $280 million.
     The $280 million restructuring and asset impairment costs related to the restructuring includes the following: $220  225 million for employee termination benefit costs; $7  8 million pension curtailment gain; and $60  65 million for manufacturing asset impairments or write-offs.
     Molex estimates that approximately all of the remaining estimated restructuring charge of $26 million will be recorded in fiscal year 2010. The restructuring is expected to result in total cash expenditures of approximately $220  225 million.
     Molex's analysis is subject to change and the timing of the implementation of these initiatives and the resulting charges and cash expenditures will be dependent upon a number of factors. If there are further exit and disposal costs in addition to the $280 million, Molex will file an amendment to this report once it is able to make good faith determinations of the estimated costs and future cash expenditures associated with its restructuring initiatives.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Lisle, Ill., USA  January 26, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
 
Revenue for the December 2009 quarter of $729.6 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on October 27, 2009 of $720.0 million and increased 8.2% from the September 2009 quarter and 9.4% from the prior December quarter. The increase in local currency was 5.5% sequentially and 4.6% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $777.9 million, an increase of 7.4% from the September 2009 quarter and 38.4% from the prior year. Positive book-to-bill ratios were reported in all primary markets.
Net income for the December 2009 quarter was $19.3 million or $0.11 per share, compared with a net loss of $11.6 million or $0.07 per share, for the September 2009 quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.6%, reflecting the tax cost of a planned repatriation of dividends from certain non-US subsidiaries in fiscal 2010.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the December 2009 quarter was $41.4 million or $0.24 per share, compared with net income of $31.7 million or $0.18 per share, in the September 2009 quarter. This result exceeded the upper end of the guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.22 per share. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded a pretax restructuring charge of $25.6 million ($22.1 million after-tax or $0.13 per share).
 
"For the third consecutive quarter we saw sequential gains in sales and incoming orders," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue was well above our prior guidance and we had a 1.07 book-to-bill ratio. Margins improved due to higher revenue, cost containment and the favorable impact of restructuring. Looking forward to our third fiscal quarter, we expect to see a smaller than normal seasonal slow down over the Chinese New Year period, returning to normal seasonal patterns thereafter. Longer term, our strong presence in Asia coupled with continued demand for new consumer electronic devices and pent up demand for information technology products should provide us with opportunities for sustained growth."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2009:
Six-Month Results
Revenue for the six-months ended December 31, 2009 was $1.4 billion, a decrease of 6.8% compared with the prior fiscal year. The decrease in local currency was 8.5%. Net income of $7.7 million or $0.04 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $81.5 million ($60.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.35 per share), and a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share.
Restructuring Update
The Company now estimates a total pretax charge through the end of fiscal year 2010 of approximately $300 million, compared with a previous estimate of $280 million. The increase is due to additional non-cash impairments for buildings resulting from continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets and additional specific actions that have been initiated as we approach the end of our restructuring program. As a result, the expected cost savings from the restructuring program has increased by $5 million to approximately $205 million on an annual basis.
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $715 to $735 million for the March 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.18 to $0.22, assuming an effective tax rate of 30.0%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $10.0 million or $0.04 per share after-tax.

Lisle, Ill., USA  April 27, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
Revenue for the March 2010 quarter of $756.3 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on January 26, 2010 of $735 million and increased 3.7% from the December 2009 quarter and 49.6% from the March 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 4.9% sequentially and 45.5% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $838 million, an increase of 7.7% from the December 2009 quarter and 76.6% from the prior year quarter.
Net income for the March 2010 quarter was $23.8 million or $0.14 per share, compared with net income of $19.3 million or $0.11 per share, for the December 2009 quarter. For the March 2010 quarter, net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $9.0 million ($7.4 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) and a pretax loss of $31.0 million ($19.8 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Molex Japan. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the March 2010 quarter was $51.0 million or $0.29 per share, compared with net income of $41.4 million or $0.24 per share, in the December 2009 quarter. This result exceeded the upper end of the guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.26 per share. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded the restructuring charge and loss for unauthorized activities in Molex Japan previously mentioned.
 
"Business conditions in our key markets continue to improve, resulting in strong operating leverage due to our new, post-restructuring cost structure," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue benefitted from a broad based recovery in all end markets and geographies with particular strength in the Industrial market, continued growth in the Automotive market as well as better than seasonal performance in the Data and Consumer markets. We are optimistic that the recovery will continue as global economic conditions improve and as our customers introduce new products. Our operating margin, excluding special charges, was 10.5% for the quarter. With further restructuring savings to be realized and revenue growth developing, we see a clear path to achieving our target operating margin of 14%."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2010:
Nine-Month Results
Revenue for the nine months ended March 31, 2010 was $2.2 billion, an increase of 7.4% compared with the nine months ended March 31, 2009. The increase in local currency was 5.1%. Net income of $31.5 million or $0.18 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $90.6 million ($67.7 million after-tax or approximately $0.39 per share), a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share and a pretax loss of $31.0 million ($19.8 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Molex Japan.
Unauthorized Activities in Molex Japan
In April 2010, Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary because it learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading activities in Molex Japan's name. This individual has admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. At this time, the total amount involved in this fraud scheme has been estimated to be approximately $193.2 million, of which Molex Japan has recognized a pretax loss in the March 2010 quarter of $31.0 million ($19.8 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) and disclosed a contingent liability of $162.2 million. The loss of $31.0 million is comprised of $20.2 million for misappropriated cash and $10.8 million for the repayment of an unauthorized loan subsequent to March 31, 2010. The contingent liability represents the current balance of unauthorized borrowings in Japan.
Restructuring Update
The Company expects to complete its restructuring program by June 2010 and estimates a total pretax charge for the entire program of approximately $300 million. The expected cost savings from the restructuring program is approximately $205 million on an annual basis.
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $810 to $830 million for the June 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.30 to $0.34, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%. Included in these estimates is a pretax restructuring charge of approximately $11.5 million or $0.06 per share after-tax. These estimates exclude any additional losses related to, or costs of the investigation into, unauthorized activities in Molex Japan.

Editor's note:
 
Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures.

We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share provide useful information to investors because both provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share may be different from similar measures used by other companies.

A web cast to discuss earnings and current market conditions will be held on August 3, 2010. A copy of the press release is being furnished as Exhibit 99.1, and a copy of the slides to be presented at the web cast is being furnished as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
     The information furnished under Item 2.02 and Item 9.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K shall not be deemed to be "filed" for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review
.
     (a) As more fully set forth below, management of Molex Incorporated, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and Molex's independent accountants met on August 2, 2010 to consider the accounting for the unauthorized activities in Japan and errors in tax related accounts in prior periods. After due consideration, management and the Audit Committee concluded that the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements and the 2010 quarterly reports should be restated. Accordingly, the financial statements filed by us relating to those periods should not be relied upon. We will file 2010 consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K subsequent to this report on August 3, 2010 containing the restated periods to supersede those earlier filings.
     As we previously reported, in April 2010, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in Japan. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japan's finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japan's name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japan's name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japan's accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation is now substantially complete. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
     At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported the outstanding unauthorized loans as a contingent liability of $162.2 million. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, an accrued liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters. In particular, we recorded cumulative net losses of $201.9 million, ($128.7 million after-tax) due to these unauthorized activities, which were comprised of (1) the asserted unauthorized loans outstanding as of June 30, 2010 of 15.0 billion ($169.7 million), (2) the payment of 1.0 billion ($10.8 million) of unauthorized loans on April 5, 2010, (3) misappropriated funds of 1.9 billion ($20.5 million), and (4) cumulative investigative costs through June 30, 2010 of $4.8 million, offset by (5) an unauthorized investment account with a balance of 0.4 billion ($3.9 million) as of June 30, 2010. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010, with approximately 15.4 billion ($167.4 million) occurring prior to June 30, 2007. The accrued liability for these potential net losses was 14.7 billion ($165.8 million) as of June 30, 2010.
     To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the outstanding unauthorized loans, we would recognize a gain in that amount.
     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we made the following adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements.
     Based on our analysis of these adjustments, we concluded that while the adjustments were not material to the operating results of fiscal years 2008 or 2009, there was an overstatement of stockholders' equity in the amount of $101.3 million, which represented 4.9% of total stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2009. Accordingly, we are restating the fiscal 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements and restating fiscal 2010 quarterly results. The restated financial statements did not impact segment reporting.

Lisle, Ill., USA  August 3, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2010 fourth quarter and its full fiscal year 2010, both ended June 30, 2010.
 
Revenue for the June 2010 quarter of $847.3 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on April 27, 2010 and increased 12% from the March 2010 quarter and 48% from the June 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 13% compared with the March 2010 quarter and 46% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $910.4 million, an increase of 9% from the March 2010 quarter and 58% from the prior year quarter.
Net income for the June 2010 quarter was $39.8 million or $0.23 per share, compared with net income of $38.4 million or $0.22 per share, for the March 2010 quarter. For the June 2010 quarter, net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $26.5 million ($24.7 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) and a pretax loss of $4.8 million ($3.0 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Japan. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.0%.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the June 2010 quarter was $67.5 million or $0.39 per share, compared with net income of $51.0 million or $0.29 per share, in the March 2010 quarter. For the quarter, non-GAAP net income excluded charges for the restructuring program and losses related to unauthorized activities in Japan. The effective tax rate for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis was 27.0%.
 
"We achieved record bookings in the quarter and hit an all time high for revenue in the month of June," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Business activity in all of our major markets is quite strong and we expect to see further growth going forward, although at a slower pace. We ended the fiscal year with strong momentum. As expected, our restructuring program is now complete and we are seeing the benefits of our reorganization and improved cost structure through both top line growth and increased earnings power."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2010:
Full Year Results
Revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2010 was $3.0 billion, an increase of 16.5% compared with the prior fiscal year. The increase in local currency was 14%. Net income of $76.9 million or $0.44 per share included a pretax restructuring charge of $117.1 million ($92.8 million after-tax or approximately $0.53 per share), a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share and a pretax loss of $26.9 million ($17.1 million after-tax or $0.10 per share) related to unauthorized activities in Japan.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the full fiscal year ended June 30 2010 was $191.7 million or $1.10 per share, compared with net income of $55.6 million or $0.32 per share in the prior fiscal year, an increase of 244% for earnings per share. For these years, non-GAAP net income excluded charges for goodwill impairment, the restructuring program, the tax adjustment related to stock compensation and losses related to unauthorized activities in Japan. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year on a non-GAAP basis was 30.4%.
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary because it learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued liability of $165.8 million as of June 30, 2010 for the outstanding unauthorized loans pending the resolution of these matters, as more fully described below. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Restructuring Update
The Company completed the restructuring program during the June 2010 quarter. The total pretax cost of the program was $315 million which is $15 million higher than previously estimated due to additional non-cash asset impairments for redundant production capacity and further reductions in the carrying cost of real estate held for sale. The expected cost savings from the restructuring program is approximately $205 million on an annual basis. To date, we have realized annual savings of approximately $172 million with $33 million still to be realized in fiscal 2011.
 
Outlook
The Company estimates revenue in a range of $850 to $880 million for the September 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.42 to $0.46, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.

Editor's note:
 
 
Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures. We refer to non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to describe earnings and earnings per share excluding the items referenced above. We believe that non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share provide useful information to investors because both provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share are used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance and segment level core operating performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share may be different from similar measures used by other companies.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note A  Net Loss on Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As we previously reported, in April 2010, we launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in Japan. We learned that an individual working in Molex Japan's finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japan's name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japan's name. We also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japan's accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. We retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation is now substantially complete. Based on our consultation with legal counsel in Japan and the information learned from the substantially completed investigation, we intend to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010, we reported the outstanding unauthorized loans as a contingent liability of $162.2 million. Based on the results of the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes an accrued liability for the effect of unauthorized activities pending the resolution of these matters. In particular, we recognized cumulative net losses of ($201.9 million, or $128.7 million after-tax) due to these unauthorized activities, which were comprised of (1) the asserted unauthorized loans outstanding as of June 30, 2010 of 15.0 billion ($169.7 million), (2) the payment of 1.0 billion ($10.8 million) of unauthorized loans on April 5, 2010, (3) misappropriated funds of 1.9 billion ($20.5 million), and (4) cumulative investigative costs through June 30, 2010 of $4.8 million, offset by (5) an unauthorized investment account with a balance of 0.4 billion ($3.9 million) as of June 30, 2010. We believe these unauthorized activities and related losses occurred from at least as early as 1988 through 2010, with approximately 15.4 billion ($167.4 million) occurring prior to June 30, 2007. The accrued liability for these potential net losses was 14.7 billion ($165.8 million) as of June 30, 2010. To the extent we prevail in not having to pay all or any portion of the outstanding unauthorized loans, we would recognize a gain in that amount.
Note B  Restatement of Prior Period Financial Statements
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we made the following adjustments to the historical consolidated financial statements.
Based on our analysis of these adjustments, we concluded that while the adjustments were not material to the operating results of fiscal year 2009, there was an overstatement of stockholders' equity in the amount of $101.3 million, which represented 4.9% of total stockholders' equity as of June 30, 2009. Accordingly, we restated the fiscal 2009 consolidated financial statements and quarterly financial statements included in this release.
 
The effect of the restatement on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2009 follows (in thousands):
The effect of the restatement on the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009 follows (in thousands):

Lisle, Ill., USA  October 26, 2010  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 first quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Revenue for the September 2010 quarter of $897.7 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on August 3, 2010 and increased 6% from the June 2010 quarter and 33% from the September 2009 quarter. The increase in local currency was 5% compared with the June 2010 quarter and 32% compared with the prior year. Orders for the quarter were $868.4 million, a decrease of 5% from the June 2010 quarter but an increase of 20% from the prior year quarter.
Net income for the September 2010 quarter was $75.1 million or $0.43 per share, compared with net income of $39.8 million or $0.23 per share, for the June 2010 quarter. Net income for the current quarter was impacted by investigative and legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $5.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or $0.02 per share). In the June 2010 quarter, net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $26.5 million ($24.7 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) and investigative and legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $4.8 million ($3.0 million after-tax or $0.02 per share). The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 32.2%, which included a charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share for the reversal of estimated tax benefits resulting from the expiration of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock at amounts less than recorded book value.
"Revenue and earnings per share reached all-time record levels in the September quarter and customer demand continued to be strong," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Our growth has been further supported by new product launches and by our Focus Account program that continues to expand and diversify our customer base, bringing us new opportunities for growth. We have now exceeded pre-recession revenue and order levels and are seeing the benefits of our new cost structure. In view of the record revenue and profits along with a more efficient organization resulting from the restructuring, we are increasing our dividend by 14.8% effective with the payment in January, 2011."
 
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2010:
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary after it was learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. The Company retained outside legal counsel and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter and that investigation has now been completed. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex. On October 13, 2010, Molex filed a written answer requesting the court to dismiss the complaint. The Company intends to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment from Molex.
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.175 per share, an increase of 14.8% from the previous cash dividend of $0.1525 per share. The increase is effective for the cash dividend payable on January 25, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2010, for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board.
Outlook
The Company has considered the modest slowing of orders in the current quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global electronics market in setting its guidance for the coming quarter. In consideration of these factors and assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $850 to $890 million for the December 2010 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.38 to $0.44, assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.

Contact: Steve Martens Vice President of Investor Relations (630) 527-4344
Lisle, Ill., USA  January 25, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 second quarter ended December 31, 2010.
Revenue for the December 2010 quarter of $901.5 million exceeded the high end of the guidance provided on October 26, 2010, increased 24% from the December 2009 quarter and was incrementally higher than the September 2010 quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 22% compared with the prior year but decreased 2% compared with the September 2010 quarter. Orders for the quarter were $872 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year quarter and in line with the September 2010 quarter.
Net income for the December 2010 quarter was $78.3 million or $0.45 per share, exceeding the high end of guidance, compared with net income of $13.8 million, or $0.08 per share, for the December 2009 quarter and $75.1 million, or $0.43 per share, for the September 2010 quarter. Net income for the current quarter was impacted by legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share). In the December 2009 quarter, net income included restructuring costs of $25.6 million ($22.2 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) and costs from unauthorized activities in Japan of $8.5 million ($5.4 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). In the September 2010 quarter, net income included legal costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan of $5.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or $0.02 per share). The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 30.3%.
"Fiscal 2011 is off to a strong start with successive quarters of revenue and earnings per share records," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "We expect our expanded and more diversified customer base, coupled with our robust new product pipeline, to position us for a strong second half to our fiscal year. In addition to these organic growth opportunities, in January we announced the purchase of Luxtera's active optical cable business which will give us a more complete offering in our high speed cable business and offer us considerable growth potential both now and for next generation technology. With our new, low cost platform, a strong balance sheet, our extensive presence in Asia and significant growth opportunities in the expanding global electronics market, we believe we are well positioned for the future."
 
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2010:
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary after it was learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. The Company retained outside legal counsel and they retained forensic accountants to investigate the matter and that investigation has now been completed. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex Japan. Molex Japan intends to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Outlook
The Company has considered the seasonal trends and the continued uncertainty in the global electronics market in setting its guidance for the coming quarter. In consideration of these factors and assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $850 to $890 million for the March 2011 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.39 to $0.43 assuming an effective tax rate of 30%.

OFFICES
The registered office of the Corporation shall be located in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware.
SECTION 1. REGISTERED OFFICE.

SECTION 2. OTHER OFFICES.
ARTICLE II.
STOCKHOLDERS
Meetings of stockholders may be held at such place, if any, as may be designated by the Board of Directors or officers calling such meetings.
SECTION 1. PLACE OF MEETING.
The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held on a weekday on such date as the Board of Directors may determine, and shall be held at a time and place to be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held on the next succeeding business day. If the election of directors shall not be held on the day designated for any annual meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors shall cause the election to be held at a meeting of the stockholders as soon thereafter as the Board of Directors determines is reasonably convenient.
SECTION 2. ANNUAL MEETING.
Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, the Secretary or the Board of Directors.
SECTION 3. SPECIAL MEETINGS.
A notice stating the date, time and place (if any) of the meeting, and in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof, shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat not less than 10 or more than 60 days prior thereto, except as otherwise required by the Certificate of Incorporation or applicable law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail so addressed, with postage thereon prepaid.
SECTION 4. NOTICE.
Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 4 shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the Corporation and shall also be deemed revoked if (a) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (b) such inability becomes known to the Secretary of the Corporation, the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. Notice given by a form of electronic transmission in accordance with these Bylaws shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by another form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. For
 
purposes of these Bylaws, "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
Any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation may be given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at such address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholders by written notice to the Corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send the single notice as set forth in this Section 4 shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting of stockholders.
When a meeting is adjourned, notice of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place (if any) thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, if the adjournment is for not more than 30 days, and if no new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact only such business, which might have been transacted at the original meeting as originally notified.
SECTION 5. ADJOURNED MEETINGS.
The holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. Whether or not such quorum is present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting or, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, only such business which may have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified may be transacted. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules and regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation or pursuant to any other regulation applicable to the Corporation or its stockholders, when a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of shares of capital stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any questions brought before such meeting (other than the election of directors). Except as otherwise set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the right of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock or any other series or class of stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, at all meetings of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, a plurality of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors.
SECTION 6. QUORUM.
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, including the rights of any holder of Preferred Stock, each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.
SECTION 7. VOTING.
 
Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date.
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date: (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be not more than 60 nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting; and (ii) in the case of any other action (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting), shall be not more than 60 days prior to such other action. If no record date is fixed: (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose (other than action by consent in writing without a meeting) shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
SECTION 8. FIXING OF RECORD DATE.
SECTION 9. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request that the Board of Directors fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such written notice is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise within ten days after the date on which such written notice is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date after the expiration of such ten day time period on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business, or to any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8 or this Section 9, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting if prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.
 
(b) In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by this Section 9 and applicable law, to the Corporation of written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of performing promptly a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent and without a meeting shall be effective until such inspectors have completed their review, determined that the requisite number of valid and un-revoked consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 9 and applicable law have been obtained to authorize or take the action specified in the consents, and certified such determination for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9 shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
(c) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days after the earliest dated written consent received in accordance with this Section 9, a valid written consent or valid written consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take such action are delivered to the Corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section 9 and applicable law, and not revoked.
SECTION 10. NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND BUSINESS PROPOSALS.
(a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the proposal of other business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders only (i) pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a stockholder of record of the Corporation at the time the notice provided for in this Section 10(a) is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation and at the time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting, and who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 10(a). In order for business to be properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder, such business (other than the nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors), as determined by the chairman of the meeting, must constitute a proper matter for stockholder action.
(1) Nominations and Business Proposals.
For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 10(a)(1)), the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed to and received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day and not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however that in the event the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
(2) Notice to Corporation.
To be in proper form, such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director, (A) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
(3) Required Contents of Notice to Corporation.
 
nomination or proposal for other business is made, (A) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner, if any, (B) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, (C) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or other proposal between or among such stockholder and/or such beneficial owner, any of their respective affiliates or associates, and any other person or persons acting in concert with any of the foregoing (including their names), including, in the case of a nomination, the nominee, (D) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, regardless of the form of settlement, any derivative, long or short positions, profit interests, forwards, futures, swaps, options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into by or on behalf of, such stockholder and such beneficial owners or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding that has been made, whether or not such instrument or right shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of the Corporation, the effect or intent of which is to create or mitigate loss to, manage risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner or any such nominee with respect to the Corporation's securities (which information shall be supplemented by such stockholder and such beneficial owner not later than ten days after the record date for the annual meeting to disclose such ownership as of the record date), (E) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (F) a representation as to whether such stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, intends or is part of a group that intends to (i) deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the voting power of the Corporation's outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the proposal or to elect each such nominee and/or (ii) otherwise to solicit proxies from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, (G) any other information relating to such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (H) with respect to each nominee for election or reelection to the Board of Directors, the completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement required by Section 10(c)(3). The Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as the Corporation may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee.
Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 10(a)(2) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting is increased effective after the time period for which nominations would otherwise be due under Section 10(a)(2) and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 10 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.
(4) Increase in Number of Directors.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders.
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the special meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of special meeting only (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof or (ii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such special meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this Section 10(b) is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation and at the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and upon such election, and who complies with the procedures set forth in this Section 10(b).
(1) Nominations of Directors.
In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by Section 10(a) shall be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
(2) Notice to Corporation.
 
90th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
(c) General.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in any applicable rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act, only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10 shall be eligible to be elected at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to serve as directors of the Corporation and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, have the power and duty (i) to determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 10 (including whether the stockholder or beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made solicited (or is part of a group which solicited) or did not so solicit, as the case may be, proxies or votes in support of such stockholder's nominee or proposal in compliance with such stockholder's representation as required by this Section 10) and (ii) if any proposed nomination or business was not made or proposed in compliance with this Section 10, to declare that such nomination will be disregarded or such business shall not be transacted. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10, unless otherwise required by law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or other proposed business, such nomination shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted, as the case may be, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation.

Nothing in this Section 10 shall be deemed to affect any rights (i) of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provision of the Certificate of Incorporation.

Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of all votes and ballots.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 25, 2011, Molex Incorporated (the "Company") and various other parties entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 2"), which amended the Credit Agreement dated as of June 25, 2009 among the Company, various lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent (such Credit Agreement, as so amended, the "Amended Credit Agreement").
Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the aggregate amount of the lenders' commitments increased to $350,000,000. In addition, the Company may, no more than twice during the term of the Amended Credit Agreement, request increases in the aggregate amount of the lenders' commitments by a total of up to $175,000,000 (which, assuming existing lenders agreed to increase their commitments and/or new lenders provided commitments, could increase the aggregate amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement to up to $525,000,000). The Amended Credit Agreement has subfacilities for up to $75,000,000 of letters of credit, $50,000,000 of swing line loans and $200,000,000 of loans and/or letters of credit in agreed-upon foreign currencies. The Amended Credit Agreement is repayable on maturity in March 2016.
The obligations of the Company and any subsidiary borrower under the Amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries and the obligations of any subsidiary borrower under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company. Molex Japan Co. Ltd. currently is the only subsidiary designated as a subsidiary borrower under the Amended Credit Agreement.
The covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement were revised to (a) increase the amount of liens, debt, investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions that may be incurred or made by the Company and its subsidiaries; (b) remove the requirement that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain a minimum amount of liquidity; and (c) tighten the leverage covenant, which requires the Company to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA of not more than 2.50:1.00.
The foregoing descriptions of Amendment No. 2 and the Amended Credit Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete terms and conditions of such documents. Copies of Amendment No. 2 and the Amended Credit Agreement are filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1.

deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Company's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement. If the Company is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Company within three Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived.
          SECTION 2.07. . (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Local Time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders; that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Applicable Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York City (or, in the case of Subsidiary Borrowers or Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, in such other location as may be reasonably designated by the Applicable Borrower) and designated by the Company in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.06(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
Funding of Borrowings
provided
provided
          (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, (x) the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (y) the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency) or (ii) in the case of the Applicable Borrower, (A) the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in Dollars) or (B) the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Borrowing, including any applicable Mandatory Costs Rate (in the case of a Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency). If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.
 
          SECTION 2.08. . (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type, in the case of Borrowings denominated in Dollars, or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Company may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections
          (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type and denominated in the Foreign Currency resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Company.
          (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
     (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
     (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
     (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and
     (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.
 
          (e) If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing (unless such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, in which case such Borrowing shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration commencing on the last day of such Interest Period). Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars may be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Borrowing, (ii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, and (iii) unless repaid, each Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month's duration.
          SECTION 2.09. . (a) Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.
Termination, Reduction and Increase of Commitments
          (b) The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments; that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments.
provided
          (c) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
provided
          (d) On up to two occasions, the Company may, from time to time, at its option, seek to increase the total Commitments by up to an aggregate amount of $175,000,000 (resulting in maximum total Commitments of $525,000,000) upon at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such increase and shall be delivered at a time when no Default has occurred and is continuing. After delivery of such notice, the Administrative Agent or the Company, in consultation with the Administrative Agent, may offer the increase (which may be declined by any Lender in its sole discretion) in the total Commitments on either a ratable basis to the
 
Lenders or on a non pro-rata basis to one or more Lenders and/or to other Lenders or entities reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Company. No increase in the total Commitments shall become effective until the existing or new Lenders extending such incremental Commitment amount and the Company shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a document in form reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (which shall include the Company's representation that the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are then satisfied) pursuant to which any such existing Lender states the amount of its Commitment increase, any such new Lender states its Commitment amount and agrees to assume and accept the obligations and rights of a Lender hereunder and the Company accepts such incremental Commitments. Upon the effectiveness of any increase in the total Commitments pursuant hereto, (i) each Lender (new or existing) shall be deemed to have accepted an assignment from the existing Lenders, and the existing Lenders shall be deemed to have made an assignment to each new or existing Lender accepting a new or increased Commitment, of an interest in each then outstanding Revolving Loan (in each case, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Assignment and Assumption) and (ii) the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the existing and new Lenders shall be automatically adjusted such that, after giving effect to such assignments and adjustments, all Revolving Credit Exposure hereunder is held ratably by the Lenders in proportion to their respective Commitments. Assignments pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be made in exchange for, and substantially contemporaneously with the payment to the assigning Lenders of, the principal amount assigned plus accrued and unpaid interest and commitment and Letter of Credit fees. Payments received by assigning Lenders pursuant to this Section in respect of the principal amount of any Eurocurrency Loan shall, for purposes of Section 2.16, be deemed prepayments of such Loan. Any increase of the total Commitments pursuant to this Section shall be subject to receipt by the Administrative Agent from the Company of such supplemental opinions, resolutions, certificates and other documents as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.
          SECTION 2.10. . (a) Each Applicable Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each of its Revolving Loans on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Company shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.
Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt
provided
          (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
          (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.
 
          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
prima
facie
provided
          (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).
          (f) If at any time the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of the Lenders exceeds the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) immediately prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess. To the extent that, after the prepayment of all Loans an excess of the Revolving Credit Exposure over the aggregate Commitments still exists, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) promptly cash collateralize the Letters of Credit in the manner described in Section 2.06(j) in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
          (g) The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate LC Exposure and the Dollar Equivalent of each Loan on each Exchange Rate Date. If at any time the sum of such amounts exceeds 105% of the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) immediately prepay the Loans in the amount of such excess. To the extent that, after the prepayment of all Loans an excess of the sum of such amounts over the aggregate Commitments still exists, the Company shall (or shall cause one or more Subsidiary Borrowers to) promptly cash collateralize the Letters of Credit in the manner described in Section 2.06(j) in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.
          SECTION 2.11. . (a) The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.
Prepayment of Loans
          (b) The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments
provided
 
as contemplated by Section 2.09(c), then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09(c). Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.
          SECTION 2.12. . (a) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily amount of the difference between the Commitment of such Lender and the Revolving Credit Exposure of such Lender (excluding its Swingline Exposure) during the period from and including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment terminates. Commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day of April, July, October and January of each year (to the extent accrued during the preceding calendar quarter) and on the date on which the Commitments terminate (to the extent not previously paid), commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
Fees
          (b) The Company agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to each Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Company and such Issuing Bank on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as such Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable in arrears on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to any Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
provided
 
          (c) The Company agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the Administrative Agent.
          (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to each Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of facility fees and participation fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.
          SECTION 2.13. . (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
Interest
          (b) The Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest at the Eurocurrency Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.
          (c) Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest as determined in accordance with Section 2.05.
          (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.
          (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, upon the final maturity thereof and upon termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.09; that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
provided
          (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that (i) interest on Borrowings denominated in Sterling shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), (ii) interest on Borrowings denominated in any other Foreign Currency for which it is required by applicable law or customary to compute interest on the basis of a year of 365 days or, if required by applicable law or customary, 366 days in a leap year, shall be computed on such basis, and (iii) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate shall be
 
determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
          SECTION 2.14. . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in any currency:
Alternate Rate of Interest
     (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period; or
     (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing denominated in such currency shall be ineffective, (ii) such Borrowing shall be converted to or continued as on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (A) if such Borrowing is denominated in Dollars, an ABR Borrowing or (B) if such Borrowing is denominated in a Foreign Currency, as a Borrowing in respect of which the rate to apply to each Lender's applicable Loan is an interest rate equal to the sum of (1) the Applicable Rate for Eurocurrency Loans, (2) the rate notified to the Administrative Agent by such Lender as soon as practicable and in any event before interest is due to be paid in respect of the applicable Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to such Lender of funding its applicable Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select and (3) the Mandatory Costs Rate, if any, applicable to such Lender's applicable Loan, and (iii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing in such currency, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing (if such Borrowing is requested to be made in Dollars) or shall be made as a Borrowing bearing interest at the rate described under (ii)(B) above.
          SECTION 2.15. . (a) If any Change in Law shall:
Increased Costs
     (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement compensated for by the Mandatory Cost Rate or pursuant to Section 2.21(b)) or any Issuing Bank;
     (ii) impose on any Lender or Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or
     (iii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes; (B) Excluded Taxes and
 
(C) Other Connection Taxes on gross or net income, profits or revenue (including value-added or similar Taxes));
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuing Bank or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
          (b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
          (c) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company (or, in the case of paragraph (a), the Applicable Borrower) shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
          (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Credit Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such withholding been made.

The Credit Parties shall indemnify each Recipient for any Indemnified Taxes that are withheld in respect of payment to, or paid or payable by, such Recipient in connection with this Agreement or any Credit Document (including amounts paid or payable under this Section 2.17(d)) and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly
Indemnification by the Applicable Borrower
 
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to the Applicable Borrower a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so withheld, paid or payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent.
          (e) . Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent for any Taxes (but, in the case of any Indemnified Taxes, only to the extent that any Credit Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Credit Parties to do so) attributable to such Lender that are paid or payable by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. The indemnity under this Section 2.17(e) shall be paid within 10 days after the Administrative Agent delivers to the applicable Lender a certificate stating the amount of Taxes so paid or payable by the Administrative Agent. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so paid or payable absent manifest error
Indemnification by the Lenders
          (f) . (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, any applicable withholding Tax with respect to any payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Applicable Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding. In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by law or reasonably requested by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable such Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 2.17(f)(ii)(A) through (E) below) shall not be required if in the Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender with respect to any tax matter. Upon the reasonable request of such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, any Lender shall update any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) (to the extent it is legally eligible to do so). If any form or certification previously delivered pursuant to this Section expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy) notify such Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of such expiration, obsolescence or inaccuracy and update the form or certification if it is legally eligible to do so.
Status of Lenders
     (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Applicable Borrower is a U.S. Person, any Lender with respect to such Borrower shall, if it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to such Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies reasonably requested by such Borrower and the Administrative Agent) on or
 
prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, duly completed and executed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:
          (A) in the case of a Lender that is a U.S. Person, IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup withholding tax;
          (B) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (1) with respect to payments of interest under any this Agreement, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "interest" article of such tax treaty and (2) with respect to any other applicable payments under this Agreement, IRS Form W-8BEN establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the "business profits" or "other income" article of such tax treaty;
          (C) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender for whom payments under this Agreement constitute income that is effectively connected with such Lender's conduct of a trade or business in the United States, IRS Form W-8ECI;
          (D) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code both (1) IRS Form W-8BEN and (2) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E (a "") to the effect that such Lender is not (a) a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (b) a "10 percent shareholder" of any Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code (c) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (d) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant interest payments are effectively connected;
U.S. Tax Certificate
          (E) in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender that is not the beneficial owner of payments made under this Agreement (including a partnership or a participating Lender) (1) an IRS Form W-8IMY on behalf of itself and (2) the relevant forms prescribed in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) and (F) of this paragraph (f)(ii) that would be required of each such beneficial owner or partner of such partnership if such beneficial owner or partner were a Lender; , , that if the Lender is a partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; or
provided
however
          (F) any other form prescribed by law as a basis for claiming exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. Federal withholding Tax together with such supplementary documentation necessary to enable the Applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the amount of Tax (if any) required by law to be withheld.
     (iii) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Withholding Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
 
reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this Section 2.17(f)(iii), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
          (g) . If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including additional amounts paid pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including any Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid to such indemnified party pursuant to the previous sentence (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(g), in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 2.17(g) if such payment would place such indemnified party in a less favorable position (on a net after-Tax basis) than such indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This Section 2.17(g) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
          (h) . Each party's obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under the Credit Documents.
Survival
          (i) . For purposes of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this Section, the term "Lender" includes any Issuing Bank.
Issuing Bank
          SECTION 2.18. . (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, Local Time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn, Floor 7, Chicago, Illinois 60603, except payments to be made directly to any Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs
 
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments hereunder of (i) principal or interest in respect of any Loan shall be made in the currency in which such Loan is denominated, (ii) reimbursement obligations shall be made in the currency in which the Letter of Credit in respect of which such reimbursement obligation exists is denominated or (iii) any other amount due hereunder or under another Credit Document shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall at or before such time have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
          (b) So long as no Event of Default exists, all payments by any Borrower hereunder shall be applied as directed by such Borrower ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of payments then due to such parties. If at any time during the existence of an Event of Default insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
          (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders except as contemplated by Section 9.04 in respect of assignments to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
provided
 
(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.
          (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any Issuing Bank hereunder that the Applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Applicable Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the applicable Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, (i) at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation (in the case of an amount denominated in Dollars) and (ii) the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (in the case of an amount denominated in a Foreign Currency).
          (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.05(c), 2.06(d) or (e), 2.07(b), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid in any order determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
          SECTION 2.19. . (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay, or to cause the Applicable Borrower to pay, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
          (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
 
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Commitment is being assigned, each Issuing Bank), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
provided
          SECTION 2.20. .
Subsidiary Borrowers
          (a) The Company may, at any time or from time to time, designate any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Company that is a Foreign Subsidiary as a "Subsidiary Borrower" hereunder by furnishing to the Administrative Agent a Designation Letter in duplicate, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, together with the items described in Section 4.01(e) and (f) relating to such Subsidiary Borrower in substantially the same form and scope as those delivered with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower designated on the date of this Agreement (or, as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require if there were no such deliveries) and such other documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any such designation by the Company and the Company shall promptly furnish any related "know your customer" information requested by any Lender. Upon such designation and the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Lender thereof (which approval each Lender shall use commercially reasonable efforts to grant within ten (10) Business Days unless such Lender has in good faith determined that there exists a practical or legal impediment to its performance as a Lender with respect to such Foreign Subsidiary (or that it would incur any incremental expense as a result of such designation for which it would not be entitled to be compensated hereunder)), such designated Foreign Subsidiary shall become a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder (with the related rights and obligations) and shall be entitled to request Revolving Loans on and subject to the terms and conditions of, and to the extent provided in, this Agreement.
          (b) So long as all Loans made to any Subsidiary Borrower and any related obligations have been paid in full, the Company may terminate the status of such Subsidiary Borrower as a Subsidiary Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Administrative Agent a Termination Letter in duplicate, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary. Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt by the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Subsidiary Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery
 
or (ii) the obligations of the Company under the Parent Guaranty or any Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guaranty with respect to any such unpaid obligations.
          SECTION 2.21. . (a) For so long as any Lender is required to comply with (i) the requirements of the Bank of England and/or the Financial Services Authority (or, in either case, any other authority which replaces all or any of its functions) or (ii) the requirements of the European Central Bank, in each case in respect of such Lender's Eurocurrency Loans, such Lender shall be entitled to require the Applicable Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of such Loans, additional interest on such Loan at a rate per annum equal to the Mandatory Costs Rate calculated in accordance with the formula and in the manner set forth in hereto.
Additional Reserve Costs
Exhibit D
          (b) Each Applicable Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender.
          (c) Any additional interest owed pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be determined by the applicable Lender, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and notified to the Applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at least five Business Days before each date on which interest is payable for the applicable Loan, and such additional interest so notified to the Applicable Borrower by such Lender shall be due and payable to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender on each date on which interest is payable for such Loan. If a Lender fails to give such notice at least five Business Days before such date, then such additional interest shall be due and payable five Business Days after such notice is given.
          SECTION 2.22. .
Defaulting Lenders
          Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
          (a) fees shall cease to accrue on the unfunded portion of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a);
          (b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.02); that this clause (b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification that proposes to (i) extend the scheduled maturity date of any principal of any Loan of such Lender or extend the date for payment of any interest on any Loan of such Lender or any fees payable to such Lender hereunder, (ii) increase or extend the Commitment of such Lender or (iii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan of such Lender or the rate of interest thereon (except for the waiver of any default rate) or any fees payable to such Lender hereunder;
provided
 
          (c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
     (i) all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent (x) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Revolving Credit Exposures plus such Defaulting Lender's Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders' Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 are satisfied at such time;
     (ii) if the reallocation described in clause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Company shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x) first, prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y) second, cash collateralize for the benefit of any Issuing Bank only the Borrowers' obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06(j) for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;
     (iii) if the Company cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is cash collateralized;
     (iv) if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to clause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders' Applicable Percentages; or
     (v) if all or any portion of such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of any Issuing Bank or any other Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender's LC Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and
          (d) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan, and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and such Defaulting Lender's then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Commitments of the non-Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Company in accordance with Section 2.22(c), and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.22(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
          In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Company, the Issuing Banks and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters
 
that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender's Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage.
          The Company represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders that:

Item 8.01 Other Events.
Unauthorized Activities at Molex Japan Co., Ltd.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has informed Molex Incorporated that the SEC has issued a formal order of private investigation in connection with the previously reported unauthorized activities in Molex Japan Co., Ltd. Molex is fully cooperating with the SEC's investigation.
As Molex previously reported, it launched an investigation into unauthorized activities at Molex Japan in April 2010. Molex learned that an individual working in Molex Japan's finance group obtained unauthorized loans from third party lenders, that included in at least one instance the attempted unauthorized pledge of Molex Japan facilities as security, in Molex Japan's name that were used to cover losses resulting from unauthorized trading, including margin trading, in Molex Japan's name. Molex also learned that the individual misappropriated funds from Molex Japan's accounts to cover losses from unauthorized trading. The individual admitted to forging documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions. Molex retained outside legal counsel, and they retained forensic accountants, to investigate the matter. The investigation has been completed. On August 31, 2010, Mizuho Bank, which holds the unauthorized loans, filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting the court to find Molex Japan liable for the payment of the outstanding unauthorized loans and to enter a judgment for such payment. We are vigorously contesting the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by Mizuho Bank to obtain payment. As stated in Molex's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010, Molex recorded for accounting purposes a liability for potential losses related to the unauthorized activities in Japan and restated prior period financial statements to record liabilities in the periods in which the unauthorized transactions and potential losses occurred.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  May 3, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fiscal 2011 third quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Revenue for the March 2011 quarter of $874.5 million increased 16% from the March 2010 quarter and declined 3% from the December 2010 quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 13% compared with the prior year quarter and declined 4% compared with the December 2010 quarter. Orders for the quarter were $880 million, an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter and 1% from the December 2010 quarter.
Net income for the March 2011 quarter was $68.1 million or $0.39 per share, compared with net income of $38.4 million, or $0.22 per share, for the March 2010 quarter and $78.3 million, or $0.45 per share, for the December 2010 quarter. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 30.4%. These periods include costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan as outlined below in our update on this matter. The March 2010 quarter also included restructuring costs of $9.1 million ($7.4 million after-tax or $0.04 per share).
 
"We were fortunate that the recent natural disasters in Japan had only a minor impact on Molex this quarter. Our employees are safe and our facilities are operational," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "Financial results for the March quarter were generally in line with our guidance and expectations; however, we do expect additional impact on our results in the June quarter due to supply chain disruptions in Japan. Fortunately, we have significant new product introductions and strong new orders outside of Japan which will help to mitigate this situation."
"The rate of expansion of mobile computing, investments in data and communication infrastructure and growth of the middle class in emerging markets continues to accelerate, driving increased demand for our many products. Our new organization structure, Focus Account program and portfolio management initiatives position Molex to benefit from these strong trends."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2011:
Unauthorized Activities in Japan
As previously disclosed, in April 2010 Molex launched an investigation into unauthorized activities in its Japanese subsidiary after it was learned that an individual had obtained unauthorized loans and entered into unauthorized trading in Molex Japan's name. The Company retained outside legal counsel and they retained forensic accountants to investigate the matter and that investigation has been completed. On August 31, 2010, the bank which holds the unauthorized loans filed a complaint in Tokyo District Court requesting payment from Molex Japan. Molex Japan intends to vigorously contest the enforceability of the outstanding unauthorized loans and any attempt by the lender to obtain payment.
Net income for the March 2011, December 2010 and March 2010 quarters were impacted by costs related to the unauthorized activities in Japan of $2.9 million ($1.8 million after-tax or $0.01 per share), $2.7 million ($1.7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share), and $8.0 million ($5.1 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), respectively.
Increase in Cash Dividend
The Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per share, an increase of 14.3% from the previous cash dividend of $0.175 per share. The increase is effective for the cash dividend payable on July 25, 2011 to shareholders of record on June 30, 2011, for each share of Common Stock (MOLX), Class A Common Stock (MOLXA) and Class B Common Stock, and will continue quarterly until further action by the Board.
 
Outlook
The Company has considered the estimated impact on revenue and earnings from the natural disasters in Japan in setting its guidance for the coming quarter. In consideration of these factors and assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $900 to $930 million for the June 2011 quarter, even after a reduction of approximately $20 million due to supply chain disruptions in Japan. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.42 to $0.48 assuming an effective tax rate of 30%. In addition, the guidance assumes unusual costs due to the events in Japan including freight, production inefficiencies and asset related charges totaling $3 to $4 million.

For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  August 3, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fourth quarter and its full fiscal year ended June 30, 2011.
Full Year Results
Revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was $3.6 billion, an increase of 19.3% compared with the prior fiscal year. Revenue in local currencies increased 16.5%. Net income for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was $298.8 million or $1.70 per share, compared with net income of $76.9 million or $0.44 per share in the prior fiscal year. Prior year net income included a pretax restructuring charge of $117.1 million ($92.8 million after-tax or $0.53 per share), and a tax adjustment related to stock compensation of $4.8 million or $0.03 per share. These periods also include costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan as outlined below in our update on this matter.

"Looking back, we are very pleased with our performance both for the current quarter and for the full year. We set annual records for revenue and profitability in a very difficult operating environment. Surging commodity costs, rapid increases in customer requirements and the natural disaster in Japan presented significant obstacles which we were able to overcome," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "As a result, we were able to increase our dividend twice during the fiscal year."
"Looking forward, the long term factors driving our business  increased mobility for consumer electronics, renewed enterprise spending, and a growing middle class in emerging economies  remain intact providing ample opportunities for growth. And, we have the right structure and people in place to take advantage of these opportunities and further grow both revenue and profit."
Fourth Quarter Results
Revenue for the June 2011 quarter of $913.7 million increased 7.8% from the June 2010 quarter and 4.5% from the March 2011 quarter. Revenue in local currencies increased 2.5% compared with the prior year quarter and 2.9% compared with the March 2011 quarter. Orders for the quarter were $906 million, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter and an increase of 2.9% from the March 2011 quarter.
Net income for the June 2011 quarter was $77.3 million or $0.44 per share, compared with net income of $39.8 million, or $0.23 per share, for the June 2010 quarter and $68.1 million, or $0.39 per share, for the March 2011 quarter. All periods include costs related to unauthorized activities in Japan as outlined below in our update on this matter. The June 2010 quarter also included pretax restructuring costs of $26.5 million ($24.7 million after-tax or $0.14 per share).

If any amount shall nevertheless be paid in violation of the foregoing to a Subsidiary Guarantor by the Company or another Subsidiary Guarantor prior to payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Holders to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
Section 8.
Effect of Bankruptcy Proceedings, Etc.
     (a) If after receipt of any payment of, or proceeds of any security applied (or intended to be applied) to the payment of all or any part of, the Guaranteed Obligations, any Holder is for any reason compelled to surrender or voluntarily surrenders (under circumstances in which it believes it could reasonably be expected to be so compelled if it did not voluntarily surrender), such payment or proceeds to any Person (i) because such payment or application of proceeds is or may be avoided, invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, impermissible set-off or a diversion of trust funds or (ii) for any other similar reason, including, without limitation, (x) any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over any Holder or any of their respective properties or (y) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by any Holder with any such claimant (including the Company), then the Guaranteed Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be reinstated and continue, and this Guaranty shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received, notwithstanding any revocation thereof or the cancellation of any Note or any other instrument evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, and the Subsidiary Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall be liable to pay the Holders, and hereby do indemnify the Holders and hold them harmless for, the amount of such payment or proceeds so surrendered and all expenses (including reasonable
 
attorneys' fees, court costs and expenses attributable thereto) incurred by any Holder in defense of any claim made against any of them that any payment or proceeds received by any Holder in respect of all or part of the Guaranteed Obligations must be surrendered. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the termination of this Guaranty, and any satisfaction and discharge of the Company by virtue of any payment, court order or any Federal or state law.
     (b) If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall at any time have occurred and be continuing, and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against the Company or any other Person of any case or proceeding contemplated by Section 8(a) hereof, then, for the purpose of defining the obligation of any Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty, the maturity of the principal amount of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if an acceleration had occurred in accordance with the terms of such Guaranteed Obligations, and such Subsidiary Guarantor shall forthwith pay such principal amount, all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all other Guaranteed Obligations, due or that would have become due but for such case or proceeding, without further notice or demand.

"Adjusted Net Assets"

For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  October 25, 2011  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its first quarter ended September 30, 2011.
 
Revenue for the September 2011 quarter was $936.0 million, an increase of 2.4% from the June 2011 quarter and an increase of 4.3% from the September 2010 quarter. This is a record for the Company and above the high end of the guidance provided on August 3, 2011. Revenue in local currencies increased 1.2% from the June 2011 quarter and declined 1.6% from the September 2010 quarter. Net income for the September 2011 quarter was $80.5 million or $0.46 per share, compared with net income of $77.3 million or $0.44 per share for the June 2011 quarter and net income of $75.1 million or $0.43 per share for the September 2010 quarter.
"Molex had another strong quarter, once again setting records for revenue and earnings per share. Production in Japan increased during the quarter as our operations recovered from the earthquake and tsunami and as our customers pushed to prepare for the Christmas selling season," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "We successfully converted the higher revenue to income, which allowed us to expand our margins and exceed our guidance for the September quarter."
"While near term demand for our products is impacted by economic uncertainty, we remain confident that the long term trends of increased mobility, growth in emerging markets and a hardware replacement cycle will continue to drive the industry forward. With our global footprint, innovative design capabilities and improved cost structure, we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities."
 
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2011:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outlook
At the current time, the global economic environment is very difficult to interpret and this uncertainty as well as our recent incoming order trend has been reflected in the Company's outlook for the coming quarter. The Company estimates revenue in a range of $870 to $910 million for the December 2011 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.37 to $0.43 assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices and an effective tax rate in the range of 30% to 32%.

For Immediate Release
Lisle, Ill., USA  January 25, 2012  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its second quarter ended December 31, 2011.
 
Revenue for the December 2011 quarter was $857.6 million, down 8.4% from the September 2011 quarter and 4.9% from the December 2010 quarter. The impact of the floods in Thailand reduced revenue in the December quarter by approximately $15 million. Revenue in local currencies declined 7.8% from the September 2011 quarter and 6.6% from the December 2010 quarter. Net income for the December 2011 quarter was $64.0 million or $0.36 per share, compared with net income of $80.5 million or $0.46 per share for the September 2011 quarter and net income of $78.3 million or $0.45 per share for the December 2010 quarter. In the December 2011 quarter, we recorded a one-time charge for additional income tax expense of $2.7 million ($0.02 per share). This charge reflects the cumulative effect of a reduction in future tax benefits from deferred tax assets in Japan resulting from a decrease in the Japanese statutory corporate tax rate enacted in November 2011.
"We continue to be optimistic about the future as our new product pipeline is quite strong and long-term growth opportunities remain healthy," commented Martin P. Slark, Molex's Chief Executive Officer. "The uncertain economic environment coupled with the disruption from the floods in Thailand, however, made the December quarter challenging from a booking and revenue perspective. We are pleased with our cost control, cash flow and resulting margins and are encouraged by improvements in recent booking trends. During the quarter we completed the purchase of Temp-Flex Cable, Inc., a specialty wire and cable company. Temp-Flex increases our presence in the medical market and will complement our high performance cable business."

Outlook
Based upon current order rates, backlog and normal seasonality, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $830 to $860 million for the March 2012 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.32 to $0.36 assuming constant foreign currency rates and commodity prices and an effective tax rate of 32%.

For Immediate Release
Lisle, Illinois  August 8, 2012  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended June 30, 2012.
Fourth Quarter Results
 
Net revenue for the June 2012 quarter was $858.5 million, a 2.6% increase from the March 2012 quarter and 6.0% decrease from the June 2011 quarter. In local currencies, net revenue increased 3.3% compared with the March 2012 quarter and decreased 4.4% compared with the June 2011 quarter. Orders for the June 2012 quarter were $901.0 million, an increase of 3.3% from the March 2012 quarter, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 to 1.0 for the June 2012 quarter.
Net income for the June 2012 quarter was $72.0 million or $0.40 per share, compared with $64.9 million, or $0.36 per share, for the March 2012 quarter and $77.3 million, or $0.44 per share, for the June 2011 quarter.
"We are encouraged with our margin performance in the June quarter even though revenue was below our expectations. More importantly, bookings have now increased sequentially in Q3 and Q4 and new product design activity remains extremely strong," commented Martin P. Slark, Chief Executive Officer. "At this time of global economic uncertainty, we have several new product introductions scheduled for the September quarter that, coupled with the pre-Christmas build, are expected to drive revenue growth at a rate in excess of the connector industry."

Full Fiscal Year Results
 
Net revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was $3.5 billion, a 2.7% decrease from the prior fiscal year. Net revenue in local currencies decreased 4.3% from the prior fiscal year.

"Despite the challenging economic environment, we are pleased with our overall operating performance during fiscal 2012. We worked hard to overcome disruptions from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the floods in Thailand. We were also very successful in fulfilling customer requirements in a record setting first quarter, which was followed by a significant slowdown in overall demand in the second quarter," commented Martin P. Slark. "For the full year we increased our gross margin while significantly improving our quality and delivery metrics, introduced many new products and generated record cash flow which allowed us to increase our dividend by 10%."
Outlook
Based upon current order rates, customer backlog and scheduled new product launches, the Company estimates revenue in a range of $900 to $940 million for the September 2012 quarter. At this level of revenue, the Company expects earnings per share in a range of $0.37 to $0.41 assuming constant foreign currency rates, unchanged commodity prices and an effective tax rate in the range of 30% to 32%.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In Molex Incorporated's ("Molex" or the "Company") conference call on October 23, 2012 regarding the Company's financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012 and the following slides, Molex may refer to non- GAAP financial measures to describe earnings for such periods excluding the items referenced in the relevant slides used during this conference call. This is in addition to disclosing the most directly comparable measure for such periods determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Molex believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they provide information about the estimated financial performance of Molex's ongoing business and provide for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the relevant slides reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures intended to be used in the conference call to the most comparable GAAP measure. Page 2

Exhibit 99.1
For Immediate Release
Lisle, Illinois  February 15, 2013 Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, announced today that it has settled litigation with Mizuho Bank, which commenced in Tokyo District Court in August 2010, regarding previously reported unauthorized loans. The charge for the quarter ending March 31, 2013 related to this settlement is expected to approximate between $21 - 23 million before tax based on current foreign exchange rates.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Molex agreed to pay Mizuho 17 billion ($183 million based on current foreign exchange rates) and Mizuho agreed to dismiss the district court proceedings and release approximately $4.6 million (based on current foreign exchange rates) that the bank has held since 2010. In addition, Mizuho agreed to release Molex from any future claims relating to the unauthorized loans and provisional attachments.
"We believe that continuing protracted and costly litigation with an uncertain outcome is not in our best interests," commented Martin P. Slark, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Molex. "This settlement, by eliminating that cost and uncertainty, allows us to focus on executing our business strategy."
As of December 31, 2012, Molex had an accrued liability of $170.7 million and disclosed a contingent liability of $66.2 million with respect to the unauthorized loans.

For Immediate Release
Lisle, Illinois  April 23, 2013  Molex Incorporated (NASDAQ: MOLX and MOLXA), a global electronic components company, today reported results for its third quarter ended March 31, 2013.
 
Net revenue for the March 2013 quarter was $852.9 million, a decrease of 11.9% from the December 2012 quarter and an increase of 1.9% from the March 2012 quarter. In local currencies, net revenue declined 11.5% compared with the December 2012 quarter and increased 3.0% compared with the March 2012 quarter. Orders for the March 2013 quarter were $909.2 million, a decrease of 1.1% from the December 2012 quarter and an increase of 4.2% from the March 2012 quarter.
Net income for the March 2013 quarter was $44.8 million or $0.25 per share, compared with $70.4 million, or $0.39 per share, for the December 2012 quarter and $64.9 million, or $0.36 per share, for the March 2012 quarter. The current quarter was impacted by the previously announced litigation settlement related to unauthorized activities in Japan, which reduced net income by $21.8 million ($13.9 million after-tax or $0.08 per share) representing amounts related to the settlement not previously accrued.
 
"Revenue in the March quarter was weaker than expected, largely due to the sharp reduction in demand from one customer for certain new programs that were launched in the September quarter and ramped significantly in the December quarter. The remainder of the business experienced a normal seasonal decline in revenue. We were able to mitigate the impact of lower revenue by closely managing manufacturing and operating costs," stated Martin P. Slark, Chief Executive Officer. "Our backlog increased both sequentially and year over year and our order rate for the quarter was stable with sequential improvements in the automotive and industrial markets. The distribution channel was also stronger this quarter and we are optimistic that the remainder of calendar 2013 will provide more robust growth opportunities."
Other financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2013:

During the third quarter, the Company recognized a charge to income from operations of $21.2 million ($13.5 million after-tax) largely for interest expense and legal fees, and incurred related transaction costs charged to other income (expense) of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax).
